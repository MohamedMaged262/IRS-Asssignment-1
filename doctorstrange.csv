https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9339210/?ref_=tturv_perm_1,More is less,"Sam Raimi returns to film directing after nearly a decade off producing (or directing for TV) with a mixed bag of tricks for Marvel, held together only by the redoubtable Benedict Cumberbatch. His place in film history already secured largely by his ""Evil Dead"" and ""Spider-Man"" achievements, he seems to have fallen prey to the George Lucas syndrome of too early retirement, as far as his first love- directing movies - is concerned.Since I'm not a Marvel fan, I found the early reels more confusing than entertaining, as if we had entered the story and Universe (Marvel, overlapping with other Marvel movies) in progress with little to no respect for viewers unfamiliar with the background -who are properly treating this 2-hour film as a single entity to watch. Though Sam includes much of his trademark flippant comedy and some dramatic moments, the relentless, slam-bang ""look at me!"" overdone special effects are wearying.I memorably (for me) interviewed Bob Tapert, Bruce Campbell and Sam together at my desk at Variety when they were working on ""The Evil Dead"" back in 1981 and was impressed with their enthusiasm about movies. I later recommended Sam be considered to direct the ""Conan the Barbarian"" sequel (he didn't get the job) when interviewing producer Ed Pressman. But I didn't expect Sam to become the sort of director accustomed to having budgets over 600 times larger than the original ""Evil Dead"". ""Multiverse"" merely underscores that often ""less is more"" applies to being a dedicated, true-to-one's-self filmmaker.",1,1,lor_,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1287548/?ref_=tturv_usr_1_t,24-Sep-23,,,

It would have killed her but he fails and is killed himself. She jumps to the prime universe where the prime Strange tries to protect America.

One must watch the TV show WandaVision before watching this. More will be coming. With all the Marvel TV, this feels like an episode, just a very epic episode. It's setting up for more to come. I do like the sarcastic humor of Strange. The alternate universe is a good way to introduce new characters and bring back old favorites. Wanda is a scary villain.

This one looks and feels different from all the rest and offers a look at the multiverse that's far more satisfying than the one seen in the overrated EVERYWHERE EVERYTHING ALL AT ONCE.

The choices the Stranges must make are interesting, but the results of those are really difficult to understand. When the movie is over, what exactly is left and which universe are we in?

What did he do and so forth ... all things that one has to answer. Maybe he was in a differeren universe (one of the other Multiverses you know?) or somewhere else. But it is just a simple welcome back to the big screens. And I am certain he will be succesful with this outing. Actually the money generated already makes this one of the biggest hits (potentially) of this year.But enough of financial and personal gain (of the director). This is a continuation of the Dr. Strange story - but also a continuation of the story of Wanda Maximoff. The nowadays better know Olson sister of them all. If you have seen Wandavision - which does not seem to be too necessary. It is a nice to know - like there may be also something that might give you some What if callback (Season 1 that is, the only one available right now). On the other hand Sam Raimi also has his usual recurring actor - in a neat small and funny role.So combine the stories (and no Spiderman, though Avengers in general get name checked) and add the Sam Raimi flavor to it. Because there is horror - so much so, that it seems like some viewers felt the need to express this here on imdb by claiming that the violence level is high. Well for a Marvel (MCU) superhero movie you can say that. Do not expect this to be super brutal though.Not much about the story was shared and I avoided most spoilers. Thankfully I did not watch the trailers - there are quite a few moments that are taken away from the first time on the big screen experience. Which was on an Imax screen for me - and in 3D. The effects were quite nice - though having the Avatar 2 trailer playing right before it ... well let's just say that looks monumental. Hopefully that will not take anything away from what some will experience.Back to this for one last time: action starts off from the start, you won't have much time to think about what is happening (which is a good thing, because there are quite a few holes to be found here), there is not enough time to explore all the Multiverses and even with 2 plus hour run time, this does not feel like it is too long - rather the opposite.As usual stay for the scenes during and after the credits. One mid and one after. Both are well worth the wait - revelation wise and the other one because it is just super funny. New characters get introduced here and the Dr. Strange universe gets expanded. I wouldn't mind seeing more of Wong ... very funny and playfully acted by .. Wong. Tempted to watch it a second time in cinemas to be honest ... you may feel the same.",37,49,kosmasp,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur5876717/?ref_=tturv_usr_7_t,13-May-22,9,/10,

When he wakes up, he goes to the wedding of Dr. Christine Palmer (Rachel McAdams). Out of the blue, an octopus-like monster attacks a bus and Dr. Strange and Wong (Benedict Wong) save a passenger, the teenager of Stephen's dream. After defeating the monster, they learn that she is America Chavez (Xochitl Gomez), and has the ability to travel through multiverses, and the monster was sent to abduct her. Dr. Strange asks Wong to protect Chavez in the Kamar-Taj with the other sorcerers. Then he heads to visit Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) and asks her to help them. But soon he learns that Wanda is the responsible for the attacks since she had acquired the Darkhold and turned into the Scarlet Witch. Now she wants the power of Chavez to meet Tommy and Billy. Dr. Strange refuses to give Chavez to her, Wanda attacks Kamar-Taj and kills many sorcerers and destroys the temple. But Dr. Strange and Chavez accidentally travel through multiverses, chased by the power of the Scarlet Witch.""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness"" is a nice adventure directed by Sam Raimi. The plot is full of action and special effects top-notch, and is highly entertaining. The conclusion disappoints, with the attitude of the invincible Scarlet Witch, but anyway it is worthwhile watching.

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8121258/?ref_=tturv_perm_12,Prepare to be ensorcelled...,"Initially then ""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness"" was not a movie that I was planning to spend a cinema ticket admission on, but I ended up doing so any way, as I went to watch the movie with my family. And while I am not overly keen on superhero movies, then Marvel does tend to pump out entertaining movies, so I figured why not.Regardless, then I would have ended up watching ""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness"" any how, be it on streaming service down the road or in the cinema I suppose. And let me just be the first to say that writer Michael Waldron's 2022 take on the ""Dr. Strange"" character and storyline made it worth sitting down in the cinema to watch. The storyline told here was really good, in fact, it was actually the most enjoyable of all Marvel's movies so far for me. So thumbs up to writer Michael Waldron and director Sam Raimi for that accomplishment.I really enjoyed the storyline told in ""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness"", as it was more than just another run-of-the-mill superhero movie where it is the main superhero against one or more villains. Sure, that element was also present here, but the storyline told here offered so much more than just that, in terms of character development, subplots and world building. And the whole thing with the Scarlett Witch was just spot on, I really loved that aspect of the storyline.What worked so well here for me was a combination of the storyline, the acting performances, the visual effects and also the fact that ""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness"" was so surreal and had some horror elements involved as well.The cast ensemble in the movie was great. Benedict Cumberbatch definitely is so well-cast for the role of Dr. Stephen Strange. But Elizabeth Olson, in the role of Wanda Maximoff/Scarlett Witch, was just phenomenal, and she gave some much to the movie. Benedict Wong, in the role of Wong, also delivered a great performance for an interesting character. And I was just thrilled to see Bruce Campbell in small cameo role here in the movie, well two actually. I wasn't at all familiar with Xochitl Gomez, playing America Chavez, but she definitely spruced up the movie quite well with her energy and performance.Visually then I was just blown backwards and bedazzled. The visual department worked great magic in ""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness"", and it was just pure eye-candy to witness all the special effects on the screen. And trust me, the visual effects here need to be enjoyed on the big screen, as does the audio effects.I was more than genuinely entertained by ""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness"" from director Sam Raimi, and I was pleasantly surprised with how appealing the movie turned out to be, despite of it being a superhero movie. For me, then ""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness"" is definitely the best of Marvel movies out there so far.My rating of ""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness"" lands on a well-deserved eight out of ten stars.",120,114,paul_haakonsen,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur22654354/?ref_=tturv_usr_12_t,6-May-22,8,/10,

And so were the fanboys and girls in the theater. I, too, have a soft spot for Marvel, but I certainly can contain my glee when an old character is brought back on screen.'Doctor Strange 2"" was fine. The multiverse was something that had already been established, and we even knew from ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" that different universes could be a lot weirder than our own. The characters were all known, so there should not have been any surprises there either.What I liked was the unleashing of Wanda Maximoff aka the Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen). I thought that Wanda had been underused and understated since her introduction. The Scarlet Witch is extremely powerful. In a comic series titled ""The House of M"" she established her own reality that affected everybody (explored in ""Wandavision""). In another story arc she said, ""No more mutants"" and wiped out all but like 98 mutants. THAT Wanda is what I'd been waiting to see and I finally got the chance. She was unstoppable in DS2, regardless of the universe, and I love seeing awesome nemeses oppose the superhero.As for Doctor Strange's cause, saving America Chavez (Xochitl Gomez), to me it was just a means to an end. America had the power to open a portal to any universe, a power Wanda wanted for herself. If America was simply a puppy Wanda wanted bad enough to kill for I think the movie would've been just as good. The point is that Wanda snapped and there was no reasoning with her so Doctor Strange had to find other means to defeat her and I was all for that.",1,1,view_and_review,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur3670492/?ref_=tturv_usr_19_t,13-Sep-22,7,/10,

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8318231/?ref_=tturv_perm_26,Doctor Strange in the Marvelverse of Mehness.,"There's something off about pretty much every aspect of 'Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2022)'. In fact, it doesn't even feel like a film. Nobody seems as though they're in the same room, several of the actors clearly don't want to be there, the editing is often bizarrely choppy, the story is all over the place (and usually feels more like an excuse to include various cameos, callbacks and sequel teases than an actual narrative), the attempts at character development are superficial, and - despite some compellingly creepy and gooey imagery - the visuals often look like something straight out of 'The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D (2004)'. A lot of the movie amounts to blatant exposition, most of which is only relevant to previous or upcoming films, and this stuff is pretty much always genuinely boring. When things do kick into gear, the action is generally disjointed and floaty. The most satisfying moments occur when a couple of characters go hand-to-hand, likely because you can tell that two people were actually in the same room at the time of filming, but most of what's supposed to be exciting simply falls flat. That's largely due to the fact that the characters are all so dull that it's hard to care about any of them. There are attempts at creating depth here and there, but these feel so tacked-on that the majority aren't even thematically relevant and their eventual conclusions inspire nothing more than a sigh. Benedicts Cumberbatch and Wong are as enjoyable as ever under the circumstances, while Elizabeth Olsen does her best with material that by-and-large butchers her character. Almost all of the fewer-than-anticipated cameos amount to throwaway gags performed by people who sound like they read their lines for the first time just moments before the camera started rolling and, in some cases, aren't even wearing an actual costume (this parody is legitimately better than the cameos it's based on). The best walk-on part is that of an old friend of the Raimi family and even that's a total non sequitur that's only enjoyable due to its blatant absurdity. Apparently, the story was in constant flux (no surprise given the picture's heavily-reported reshoots) and the ending was figured out halfway through production. In all honesty, it shows; this flick is one heck of a mess. I mean, this review is more structured and it's little more than an agitated ramble. Though Raimi manages to sneak in some enjoyable direction every once in a while, the majority of the piece is bland and intangible. Plus, outside of a brief montage showcasing a variety of increasingly ludicrous - and therefore interesting - universes, the picture takes place in the most basic alternate realities imaginable, completely wasting its premise in the process. The movie's enigmatically schlocky title totally oversells the actual affair, as there's very little madness to this particular multiverse. Really, the experience is totally outshone by 'Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse (2018)', in terms of both visuals and narrative. Heck, even 'Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021)', a feature that suffers from some of the same problems as this, blows it out of the water, primarily because it remembers to attach actual characters to its cameos and ensures that even its most surface-level references are enjoyable to some degree. I feel a bit sorry for Raimi, actually; he swapped the studio meddling of Sony for the studio stifling of Marvel. Given the chance, I'm fairly confident he could come up with a weird and wonderful take on the eponymous character and his escapades through an infinite amount of alternate realities. Marvel still isn't letting their directors do their own thing, though. No matter how hard they try to hide it, there's no mistaking the calculated hand of Kevin Feige pulling the strings. As I mentioned up top, 'Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2022)' doesn't even feel like a real film. Instead, it plays like a checklist of things nobody asked for. It admittedly gets more entertaining as it goes along and there are a handful of sequences which are appropriately Raimi-esque. These scenes, which mostly deal in horror-infused action, can be fairly fun (notably those towards the end of the affair). Plus, the lead actors lend credence to the generally weak (and occasionally terrible) screenplay. However, the film's all-too-brief best moments are still hampered by some seriously iffy editing and the fact that the narrative typically fails to do anything even remotely engaging. Also, like in the similarly disappointing 'Eternals (2021)', the insipid post-credits scenes are blatant parodies of themselves. The whole thing just stinks of wasted potential, really. Surely there's a much better version of this somewhere in the multiverse of our own, but sadly we'll never get to see it.",10,9,Pjtaylor-96-138044,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur26820801/?ref_=tturv_usr_26_t,9-Jul-22,5,/10,
https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8422211/?ref_=tturv_perm_27,Stranger Things,"I've said before that I've not really followed the Marvel Cinematic Universe at all, really just dipping in and out of selected titles without any thoughts about how one movie might cross over with another in the one continuing over-arcing narrative. But I was intrigued by the Doctor Strange character having recently read some of the early comics, lately watched the first movie and basically just being a fan of anything to do with the mystical arts. Coincidentally though I had also just recently watched the *Wanda-Vision"" TV series which introduced me to Elizabeth Olsen's Scarlet Witch character who features very prominently here.If, like me then, you're not completely or even partially au-fait with all the characters and situations either in recent Marvel comics or Marvel movies, this one apparently also follows on from the ""Far From Home"" Spider-Man movie which I haven't seen.It certainly starts with a splash as we see Benedict Cumberbatch's Doctor Strange accompanied by a young female companion played by Xochitl Gomez who goes by the name of America Chavez, whose full significance to the plot will emerge later, fight a titanic battle on the edge of the universe and just when they seem to be losing, escape via a portal the girl creates, to a different universe which happens to be ours in the here and now.It turns out that the young girl's portal-hopping power is desired by the Scarlet Witch so that she can find a universe where she can reunite with her two infant children who she knows are out there somewhere in an alternative world.And that's pretty much the narrative in a nutshell as we see an increasingly paranoid Wanda the Witch use any means necessary to try and prise the girl away from Strange's protection. This perpetual chase leads eventually to a fantastical other-wordly castle high atop a sheer mountain peak, where she, Strange, America and Sorcerer Supreme (Benjamin) Wong fight a frenzied final battle which is only resolved when the Witch has to endure a chastening ""careful what you wish for"" moment.Like I said, I don't know enough to join the dots of everything I saw here but I get that true fans would have savoured the cameo appearances, if not the fates, of other characters like Reed Richards, whose appearance triggers the movie's funniest line by Strange and a rather frail Dr X played of course by Patrick Stewart. Talking of which, this was pretty much negated by the odd, misfiring ""No expletive deleted, genius"" intended in-joke line which Strange utters, in apparent denial of Cumberbatch's breakthrough TV role.The movie though is undoubtedly about the SFX which are as wonderful and imaginative as ever. The epic settings, the fight sequences and especially all that kaleidoscopic, scene-shifting action some of it in a decidedly wonky New York City are all eye-poppingly good.So don't try to hard to engage with the intricacies of the plot, don't go looking for deep characterisation, just run down the chase to its end and appreciate all the set-pieces along the way.And yes, the adventure doesn't stop here, as the inter-end-titles epilogues make clear...",2,2,Lejink,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur15298231/?ref_=tturv_usr_27_t,10-Aug-22,7,/10,

The problem is that I can't remember anymore. There were so many movies and I barely remember a few of them. I remember there was a time when people were praising Marvel films for great characters and story, nominated them for Oscars (though mainly for special effects and the likes), but I don't remember which.

The plot shifts in many surprising and random directions that for me involve some great ideas. I particularly liked the use of the character Wanda Maximoff, the cameos introduced via the multiverse, and the 'Evil Dead' direction used in the later scenes. Also it nicely lays more foundations for expansion (or should I say incursion) of the MCU into other franchises.I think if you take superhero movies seriously you will have issues with the how random the plot is, but if you go along with certain concepts for the ride and take aspects such as the horror sequences, with a tongue in cheek spirit there is plenty to enjoy.What makes it feel a bit bloated and rushed at times is the volume of action spectacle. It starts with a frenetic sequence and the pattern continues throughout with very little respite for characters (outside Wanda) to develop or connect with the audience. I felt it's length and found myself thinking ""Okay, another battle of superpowers, can we hurry this up?""There is also a tiresome amount of exposition dialogue, presumably due to the plot being relatively more complex than your average mainstream popcorn flick and the amount of relevant content required to know from other movies and shows.Benedict Cumberbatch and Elizabeth Olsen are easily the standout performers, particularly Olsen who gives another star turn as Wanda.

Similar to Spider-Man: No Way Home, I can't say much about the movie. It's best to go in without knowing anything, like I did (I don't watch trailers). What I will say is, I loved it and it's awesome.The MCU continues to find a way to stay fresh, utilizing the multiverse and its endless possibilities. This movie rewards those who have kept up with everything, which I love. This movie is more concerned with the fans than the casuals, WHICH I LOVE. This movie pushes the boundaries of PG-13 rather than catering to children... WHICH... I... LOVE (although I wish they would just go full R and simultaneously release PG-13 versions for the families).My only flaw is that I thought the first half was better than the second half. It doesn't escalate as much as I would've liked. Although that may change on second viewing when I know what to expect. But I compare it to Spider-Man: No Way Home, in which the movie was beastly throughout, but then escalated to a new level during the last 40 minutes. I would rank MoM behind No Way Home and just behind the original Doctor Strange.I have to give major props to the MCU. I'm not a fanboy (and there's nothing wrong with being one), I've never read a comic and my only exposure to Marvel is the 90s Spider-Man and X-Men cartoons. But I love movies and they continue to consistently give me great iterations with these great characters. I was worried that phase 4 would be a letdown after the amazing conclusion to phase 3, but almost every show and movie has been great since then, with the standouts for me being Shang-Chi, Loki, No Way Home, Moon Knight and now MoM. The MCU is too beastly.

Your desecration of reality will not go unpunished."" Mordo (Chiwetel Ejiofor)Well, thank you, Baron, but the punishment is exacted now with my trying to make sense of the messy multiverse of the new Marvel showcase, Dr. Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. It's as if Marvel called its prominent heroes for a conference, planned by the Marx Brothers, without a drop of humor.Make no mistake, there is much for geeks here (my audience was packed with Marvel madness): gorgeous CGI, gorgeous Elizabeth Olsen (The Scarlet Witch, Wanda Maximoff, et al., just an uber sorceress), gorgeous Rachel McAdams (Dr. Christine Palmer and former Strange lover), and the chameleon actor, Benedict Cumberbatch (Dr. Strange). Should be enough to make a classic if there wasn't so much territory to cover in just over 2 hours. That's several universes, which also contain sinister duplicates of many characters. Too much goodness, too little time.After Strange dabbles in a forbidden spell, he ushers in the multiverse with versions of himself too powerfully bad even for Strange, Maximoff, and Wong (Benedict Wong). This Marvel mess is aided by the usual Marvel tropes of power coming from hands and boulders shattering, together with warped cities, paint people, and so much more. Even the staple of most hero films, Wanda's search for family safety, is present with too little fanfare because it is the most affecting human endeavor of the film.Director San Raimi has brought his chops from previous Spider Man episodes that successfully joined three Spider Men actors to more or less successfully join different characters; it is too unclear here the differences except for a third eye or two.Although hope is here in the form of a new super-powered teen, America Chavez (Xochitl Gomez), who can jump the universes with ease, she doesn't know how to use this power, and we don't have time to grow with her. Dr. Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is itself overgrown but still a mélange of images and ideas to spark the interest of comic book fans and critics up for the challenge.",49,43,JohnDeSando,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1391596/?ref_=tturv_usr_36_t,6-May-22,,,
https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8145154/?ref_=tturv_perm_37,The Quick and The Dead,"Look. I know. The film only really makes sense if you've seen not only the twenty five previous MCU films but also now the Disney Plus TV shows and you can debate whether a film is truly working if it requires that much previously gained background knowledge before you go in. . . But here's the thing, I have. I've seen them all, even the ""Inhumans"" series, and with all that - and the fact that I'm a huge ""Evil Dead"" fan - it's not perhaps surprising that I loved this.Still dealing with the aftereffects of saving the world, Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) is called into action again when he saves a young woman, America Chavez (Xochitl Gomez) from an attacking giant creature. The creature is stalking Chavez because of her power, to jump between multiverses, a power that she can't control but that has cost her dearly so far. As the pair discover who is behind the creature attack, they are forced to take refuge in an alt-world, but their antagonist discovers a dangerous way to follow them.What I can't believe is how much the film must have been altered to greater fit the aesthetic and predilections of Sam Raimi. We're not just talking a cameo from Bruce Campbell and the Delta Oldsmobile - but sound design choices, such as the movement of the camera mimicking those from ""The Evil Dead"", the hell monsters that resemble Dead-ites and there are even music cues that sound like ones from that series. It was excellent to the small percentage of a modern audience who could relate the two properties.As I say, I can't imagine what anyone who hasn't seen ""Wandavision"" might have made of it, but I was certainly all for perhaps the most 'inside baseball' film the MCU have made so far. It was funny, it looked great and was definitely the most horror infused that the series has been. You can't talk about the cameos - though if you've got this far without seeing the film and not seen those cameos online somewhere, really well done.There are dozens of other aspects of the movie that I could talk about, characters and moments, but I've already surpassed my usual word limit. Suffice it to say that I really liked this, and I can't wait for ""Thor"", ""Ms. Marvel"" and whatever Sam Raimi decides to do next.",8,11,southdavid,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0715971/?ref_=tturv_usr_37_t,15-May-22,8,/10,
https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9543371/?ref_=tturv_perm_38,"Generic superhero film, but Sam Raimi manages to balance different tones, being chilling and tense, morbid humor, humor and a lot of dramatic substance in a fun enterteinment","The script, written here by the person responsible for the ""Loki"" series, Michael Waldron, shows Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) in search of protection for América Chavez (Xochitl Gomez), a young woman from another universe who has the ability to travel between realities. The Avenger seeks help from Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen), but ends up realizing that a greater evil is behind the hunt for Chavez, which makes him travel through countless worlds in order to save the girl and, at the same time, try to understand the reasons why he himself became someone who alienates loved ones and loses great powers - after all, he is not with the love of his life, Dr. Christine Palmer (Rachel McAdams), nor is he the Supreme Wizard - Wong (Benedict Wong) took over the post.Just like Strange, Raimi sees himself in a world full of possibilities and takes advantage of each one of them. The hero becomes, just like Spider-Man, a reflection of the director's aspirations on screen. There are no limitations to where these powers can go, or how they can be used. The director and protagonist duo take advantage of this to exercise their creativity, taking the audience on a journey as psychedelic and fun as the character's craziest comics. Raimi mixes realities as if he were uniting genres, bringing a little of the comic horror of ""Death of the Demon"", a lot of the adventure of ""Spider-Man"" and a good handful of ""Darkman"".The moral and emotional dilemmas present in this film place Strange in complicated positions that force him to make important decisions for the stability of the multiverse and the survival of all beings and their versions. However, the entire feeling of ""Multiverse of Madness"" is found in Wanda's arc. The countless traumas of someone who lost her brother, husband (several times) and, more recently, her own children lead Wanda down evil paths, ending up ""transforming"" into the great villain, the Scarlet Witch. This is where the series helps to develop this character deeply, adding her to the debate of best villains in the entire MCU. Wanda's motivations are surrounded by devastating grief and an immense desire to reunite with her family. The multiple obstacles that arise to stop her mission are annihilated with such brutality and lack of mercy that any viewer will be left awestruck by the witch's invincible power. The entire cast delivers excellent performances, but Cumberbatch and especially Olsen are on another level. The actor demonstrates his versatile talent by playing several different versions of his character, while the latest proves that he is one of the best actresses in Hollywood today.But what is more generic about ""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness""? The plot is made up of small tasks (as in procedural series) that accumulate new features. Within this, the feeling of a guided tour exceeds acceptable limits at certain times. There is always someone on stage willing to ""chew"" the circumstances so the viewer doesn't have to think; in each different place there is always someone willing to tell you where everyone is, how they got there and how to reach a possible exit; Whenever a person does something emphasized as important to the whole, someone immediately explains in detail what happened to a conveniently unsuspecting colleague (he's explaining it to the viewer, in fact). The battle scenes are dynamic, but many are not exciting because they are limited to magic duels that place actors and actresses at a distance, making faces and mouths, while digital effects materialize the enchantments. In this sense, the feature film does not have as much physicality, being basically hostage to the sumptuousness that post-production conjures. As Strange and America flee from the Enchantress, we better understand how the multiverse works, what are the powerful sources of wizards and sorcerers, and what artifacts guarantee the success of good in the face of evil. It works, but it could be less common, more exciting and vigorous.But perhaps the production's best choice, besides hiring Raimi, is Michael Waldron's simple and lean script, even with all the observations already mentioned. It's a film that could easily fall into a complex narrative with many explanations about the multiverse, want to close loose ends from previous MCU works to the detriment of the story itself, and, of course, become an empty bath of fan service as happened in the last one Spider-Man film, but the text is very uncomplicated. The screenwriter is more interested in providing a basis for Raimi's sense of spectacle than making the work a nerdy orgasm of theories and nostalgia. In fact, the film only has a single situation that I would consider fan service for fans to applaud, and even in this the film knows how to use references organically in the story, as part of the crazy narrative, still subverting nostalgia with a comedic horror ending. Unexpected and completely hilarious.There is even a certain disregard for mythology in the film. The multiverse is basically an allegory without explanations or rules; the story has a million Macguffins (starting with America Chavez herself and ending with mystical books); and the narrative has some didacticisms (even boring ones at the beginning of the film) to quickly go through contextualization, going straight to the central point of the story: Raimi's genre exercise, mixing heroism with horror. The filmmaker is very inspired, using and abusing vertiginous zooms, Dutch angles, wild scene transitions, superimposed editing, extreme close-ups, sparse and well-composed jumpscares, quick shots that enlarge or narrow environments, and his characteristic shots from the point of view of the characters. His camera is basically a character, chasing, grabbing, flipping, slamming and flying between dimensions. All of this to the sound of a grunge soundtrack and strange riffs that outline the 80s horror atmosphere.The highly anticipated cameos in trailers and leaked news are nothing more than just that: introductions to new characters or variations of known ones, the latter of which were probably just a flash in the pan. On the one hand, it is to be applauded the fact that they were not enchanted by the success of ""Sem Volta a Casa"" and filled ""Multiverse da Madness"" with endless cameos and fan-service. On the other hand, there is literally only one sequence where they deliver everything at once, which is partially disappointing and dangerous for the future. The intention, obviously, was to show Wanda's impressive power without restrictions, but Raimi loses control of this specific situation, not by giving too much value to Wanda, but by belittling other heroes, who are defeated extremely easily (it's of course, the male heroes go first, leaving the female heroes to actually try to fight Wanda... Not to mention the fact that America has two mothers and other agendas inserted more discreetly to please Hollywood's political militancy).The best moments in the production are when the director breaks Marvel conventions. Wanda running after the good guys covered in blood, dragging her leg through the maze corridors is an image clearly evocative of horror tradition; the villain's fight against a team of superheroes formed in another universe - their revelation is the plot's biggest surprise - has ingredients of violence that are uncommon in current blockbusters; finally, the circumstance involving the emergence of a zombie Avenger. That's right: zombie. It is probably the most stylish and out-of-the-box image of the studio's recent productions. In part, Sam Raimi fulfills his promise to make the first horror film in the Marvel Universe that currently also includes television narratives. The director displays his personal signature in key moments and even takes the plot out of a comfortable commonplace in certain very good passages. But, despite this, it does not avoid certain recurrences that have become clichés in Marvel films, given the transformation of the spectator into a passive agent who expects to receive more of the same as a reward for loyalty.It's also remarkable how Raimi controls the chaos. Each scene composition is very careful, ranging from moments of suspense and tension (especially in domestic environments), to the anarchic situations of the villain's pursuits who, little by little, are transformed into a kind of demon in the excellent use of body horror and presence constant, urgent and omnipresent character. At times it is a monster masterpiece straight out of B movies, at other times it is dreamlike and surreal in its kaleidoscopic sequences (much more imaginative and constant than in the first film). All this diversity and creativity perfectly reflects the story that crosses infinite alternative realms, with zombies, hauntings, and so on. There is plenty of praise for the production design, the photography that transitions naturally between explosions of color and dark moments, and especially the CGI that adds to the experience, unlike the dark and generic special effects of other recent blockbusters. In fact, there is a scene in which Strange battles with musical notes that is a dazzling sight to the eyes and ears, an unbelievable visual symphony.In the midst of insanity, Sam Raimi manages to balance different tones. At times the film is chilling and tense, containing morbid humor, but at other times there is a silly comedic feel (in the best sense of the word), and also a lot of dramatic substance. Raimi evokes themes similar to his Spider-Man trilogy, such as responsibility, power and selfishness, featuring several touching moments in a multiverse full of internal reflections and character possibilities.",2,1,fernandoschiavi,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur33162918/?ref_=tturv_usr_38_t,5-Jan-24,7,/10,

Thanks the the Tobey Maguire Spider-Man trilogy, he was well-versed in directing superhero movies, and with the hype around this Doctor Strange sequel having supernatural horror elements, it sounded like he could flex some of his Evil Dead-ish magic, too.But then I heard sort of mixed things about this, when it first released, and I lowered my expectations. That led to me being pleasantly surprised by this in the end, as I thought it was very good (for the most part). It doesn't always utilise its multiverse premise to its full potential (doesn't help that Everything Everywhere All At Once just perfected what a multiverse movie could be last month), and it doesn't have the most satisfying story.But in the moment, I thought it was a lot of fun, had some great visuals, solid performances all around, and plenty of Sam Raimi's signature style. Being a big fan of his, I loved how much of this felt like his movie, as I know that sometimes, a director's style gets drowned out in these sorts of big budget blockbusters.I will say, the story did Chiwetel Ejiofor dirty, as I swear the first Doctor Strange set him up to have a big role somewhere down the road. And while I think Wanda was used well, they didn't really address where Vision was? Which seemed odd, seeing as this seemed to build off WandaVision.But in the end, there was too much I liked about this to be too disappointed.

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8261772/?ref_=tturv_perm_49,Among The Better Entries In MCU's Post-Endgame Saga,"The 28th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is the first entry in their Phase 4 slate of films that comes bearing a director's signature despite it following the standard Marvel formula. There is a slightly rejuvenating quality to it that has got more to do with the directorial craftsmanship on display than the scripted premise and when it taps into the madness, it is at least somewhat fun.Directed by Sam Raimi (The Evil Dead & Spider-Man 2), the story takes a while to find its footing but once it does, the momentum isn't entirely lost as it dives into the darker elements and delivers a picture that's consistently amusing. Raimi directs the formulaic story with passion & finesse while also taking half measures on the horror & camp aspects and he hasn't had this much fun in a while coz whenever the execution is good, it's very good.The overblown CGI continue to add nothing of substance as we find Strange traversing through multiple realities where meets several mystical allies & adversaries, both old & new. However, his own personal journey & growth isn't much appealing this time around. The show-stealer is Wanda Maximoff who embraces her Scarlet Witch persona to unleash havoc & horror with a gleeful ruthlessness that makes her scenes a fascinating & thrilling delight to watch.Overall, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness ranks amongst the bearable films in MCU's post-Endgame saga and also benefits from Raimi's direction who manages to get plenty of mileage out of the serviceable script. While the film plays by the studio rules for the most part, the seasoned filmmaker nonetheless makes sure that his style & trademarks are imprinted on the finished product to at least some extent if not all the way. In short, Marvel Studios' latest is worth checking out.",2,5,CinemaClown,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur20018357/?ref_=tturv_usr_49_t,22-Jun-22,,,
https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9789092/?ref_=tturv_perm_50,"A colossal work of incredible CGI, in which the script is quite lost, and the actors do a good job playing characters they already know well.","Contrary to my custom, I saw this film directly after the first one. It wasn't my will, it was the TV channel that decided to show them in sequence. And that's good: things are clearer and more understandable if we have previously seen the initial film, which explains the origin of the character and her journey. There are some aspects and details of the script that I didn't understand, but as Marvel tends to chain its films together, as if they were the threads of a tapestry, I believe that what I didn't understand will be related to the number of Marvel films that I still didn't have the opportunity to see it.The film is directed by Sam Raimi, which immediately raised my eyebrows: after all, he is a truly creative and intelligent director, who has already given us works worthy of praise, although hero films have not gone well for the director in the past. As far as I know, production was extremely confusing and, as we know, heavily affected by the recent pandemic. Raimi took advantage, rewrote a good part of the script and revised everything, in order to create a bizarre, somewhat scary story (he started out as a director of cheap horror films, let's remember), about the multiverse, a concept that has been explored a lot in the cinema of this decade.As expected, the film was a brutal success, both at the box office and in terms of specialized critics, having registered the fourth-best box office of 2022, and was sacramentally ignored by the Oscars, even in the visual and technical categories where, in my opinion, opinion, he could have had a good chance of winning a prize. In fact, the film is a visual spectacle of supreme proportions, making the most of the multiverse's enormity of possibilities for a visual experience that is worth it in itself. If the first film had already been colossal in terms of effects and CGI, this film surpasses it almost in every way. The sets, costumes, props, makeup, everything was thought out in minute detail and makes good use of the huge budget that Marvel made available. And the work of the stuntmen and choreographers was excellent in the action and fight scenes.The script brings together two characters from the Marvel universe in the same story: the already known Dr. Strange and the Scarlet Witch, Wanda Maximoff. Before this film, and what came before it, I didn't know them because I'm not a big fan of comics, although I recognize Marvel's exceptional work in this field over several decades. There is also a third character who enters here, America Chavez, a young Latina who, honestly, must be some kind of third-line character, but who assumes considerable relevance to the plot. In general, the script seems weaker to me than that of the first film, and this could be a direct consequence of the immense confusion that was the entire process of conceiving and producing the film, between a pandemic, withdrawals and all sorts of setbacks.Benedict Cumberbatch returns to his character and does a job well done, although the actor seems to be working with slightly less interesting material and entering a comfort zone that makes things more monotonous. Elizabeth Olsen was also perfectly at ease with her character, as she had already played it in other films in the Marvel universe that I, as far as I remember, have not yet seen. She is quite good at what she does, and the actress's work is convincing. There are also several other actors from the first film who return for a new job: Rachel McAdams and Chiwetel Ejiofor have an easier job, but it seems to me that the film doesn't particularly take advantage of them. Much better luck had Benedict Wong, with impeccable work, and Xochitl Gomez, who made positive use of the opportunity, even without deserving the spotlight.",2,2,filipemanuelneto,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur53053227/?ref_=tturv_usr_50_t,14-May-24,7,/10,

The dazzling and pop-out colorful CGI need to be appreciated at least on a huge IMAX screen. The story for me actually was very coherent and flowed very nicely, albeit still too long at 126 mins, yet just right compared to the almost 3+ hour long past superhero films. The story was a little monotonous, but at least wasn't convoluted. I did want some more laughs that lacked compared to previous Marvel films, like the Illumawhatti comment. Yet still, it was entertaining, thanks mostly in part to Gomez and Cumberbatch's chemistry and excellent performances. However, I did feel that Olsen's performance lacked realism and conviction, and felt more like a called-in performance.Nevertheless, a great and unique story, with spot-on teaser end-credits scenes that enticed me to look forward to what's next in the MCU, and made me laugh out loud when the final scene showed the vendor.

Less childish than other recent MCU outings, the second semi-solo outing of 'Earth's Supreme Sorcerer' is moderately entertaining but not particularly innovative or memorable. The CGI is spectacular but little clever is done with the concept of inter-universe travel (one particularly banal example has different coloured streetlights) and the entire premise, along with Strange's and The Scarlet Witch's vast occult powers, means that pretty much anything can happen, so it's hard to care about what does. Typical of the Disney era, MCU villains, no matter how wicked, end up redeemed (and their various PG-rated atrocities conveniently forgotten). The cast is fine playing comic-book characters, but Ejiofor isn't given much to do beyond being a human McGuffin (and ticking off a few boxes on Disney's current casting priorities). Presumably as a nod to director Sam Raimi's iconic frugal-spookers (like 1981's 'The Evil Dead'), there are some gratuitous (and ineffectual) horror-tropes thrown in (the zomboid return of a mutilated character suffers from second-rate makeup/CGI and there is a ridiculous scene where an arcane and all-powerful entity who can fly (and teleport) is suddenly reduced to lurching along on foot).

The next morning Stephen responds to a monster attacking the city and comes across the girl from his dreams America Chavez (Xochitl Gomez) who possesses the ability to travel between universes. Eventually it is learned that America is being hunted by Wanda Maximoff/The Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) who following the events in Westview, New Jersey has been corrupted by an evil spell book called the Darkhold which fuels her obsession at regaining her children who were lost when her hex on Westview collapsed. Now Stephen and America traverse the multi-verse in search of a way to end the Scarlet Witch's rampage.After the success of the first Doctor Strange, Cumberbatch was signed for at least one more sequel while still making appearances in other MCU properties. The original creative team of writer/director Scott Derrickson and co-writer C. Robert Cargill had initially been eager to return, but following creative differences with Derrickson and Cargill's original pitch going in a different direction from where Marvel wanted, they amicably left and instead worked on low budget horror The Black Phone. The duo were eventually replaced by director Sam Raimi and Loki and Rick and Morty writer Michael Waldron with the production going through several on the fly revisions due to being so intertwined with not only the Disney+ series Wandavision, but also Spider-Man: No Way Home. The film became a massive success making just shy of $1 billion against a $200 million budget improving upon the haul of the original film but critical reception tended to be more mixed. While the movie does benefit from strong performances and Raimi's energetic directorial style, it is a slight step down in quality from its predecessor.To start off on the strong points, Cumberbatch remains good as Stephen Strange and continues to inhabit the character quite well in terms of carrying his acerbic wit with twinges of unresolved pain. We also get Xochitl Gomez as America Chavez and she makes a great impression in the role and becomes a sort of protégé for Strange in addition to being a protectee with the two bonding over shared pains and regrets. Elizabeth Olsen reprises her role as Wanda Maximoff/The Scarlet Witch and while she is good in the role it does feel like a larger scale revisit back to the House of M inspired material we saw in Wandavision only on a larger scale. The fact that the movie is so heavily predicated on the audience having seen that miniseries does count against the movie as being a film unto itself. As expected Raimi is a lot of fun in the director's chair and he gives us some unique (and surprisingly brutal) visuals that harken back to his horror comedy days. Not quite at the intensity of the first two Evil Deads, but somewhere between Drag Me to Hell and Army of Darkness. I will however say the titular multiverse isn't all that impressive as we're really only shown two as major setpieces and both aren't all that memorable especially since one relies on characters who with the exception of some haven't had much establishment in the MCU and don't have the impact they should. If there's any one word I'd feel best describes Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, it's overstuffed. There's a lot of elements that do work but they do feel like they're fighting for attention to the point that a pretty major point of contention between Strange and America stemming from her encountering him in an alternate universe feels like it's resolved pretty easily.Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is a fun film that does feel like it could've benefitted from some additional polish work on the script. The fact the movie is also heavily tied in with Wandavision and Spider-Man: No Way Home does also make the movie feel a lot more messy and less streamlined than it should be. The movie does still entertain thanks to some strong character moments, performances, and Raimi's direction however.",4,2,IonicBreezeMachine,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur117926588/?ref_=tturv_usr_65_t,22-Apr-23,7,/10,

Because essentially that's what it's like.And how do I write a review for this film without spoilers?I liked it when that character turned up, but felt that they were under utilised. That other guy was a total DILF and I hope that he comes back in future Marvel films. I also liked that they used that other fella from that series that wasn't so good and reinvented that woman that wasn't so good before either. Oh and Benny's hair was terrible. That's about all that I can say about the story itself.However, I felt that the whole thing should have been a ""Multiverse"" film that included Dr Strange and not claimed to be about him. That would have let them bring in loads of other characters and created a better story. In fact they could have made a series out of it, where with each episode he lands in a new universe and he has to work with a different team or individual from the Marvel catalogue of heroes and villains to move forward. I wouldn't have minded them doing that to set up new series' and other films.This one though, really isn't about him, but rather a continuation of the 'WandaVision' (2021) story. If you haven't seen that, then this film won't fully make sense. You may also want to make sure that you've seen the 'What If' (2021) cartoon series before watching it too, although I obviously can't tell you why.It's a shame, because I really wanted to enjoy this second instalment. The first Dr Strange film felt a bit like something that they had to quickly shoehorn in to production in order to make 'Avengers: Infinity War/Endgame' (2018/9) work.But I had hoped that the Doc, having been more well established since then, would get a better story for his own sequel, especially after his appearance in 'Spider-Man: No Way Home' (2021), which also has a build in to this story, but not to the same extent as Wanda.However I felt that because it relied on magic instead of science, the rules are always thrown away a bit. With science fiction, it is based on what can actually be achieved, as far as we as a society currently know, but with magic they've only got to find a new or different spell to get around things and that felt like somewhat of a cop out.It also lacked some polish, as if they got to the end and the CGI/special effects had cost so much that they couldn't afford the reshoots to take out some of the more corny elements, because some of the acting was quite bad in places.It actually seemed like a ""Made For TV Special"" from the 90's. It smacked of 'Xena: Warrior Princess' (1995-2001) and 'Hercules: The Legendary Journeys' (1995-9) with some 'Buffy The Vampire Slayer' (1997-2011) thrown in.My Mother watches some of the science fiction and fantasy films (The ones made purely to keep the ex cast members of soap operas in work) that come up on what I call the ""Hallmark"" channels. I have been unfortunate enough to catch one or two of them and they've had a similar construction to this film.It just felt like the whole film was the productions way to showcase new potential characters, like bringing out new actors at a comicon to gauge the audience's thoughts.I'd like them to focus on what has been established already and build on that instead of introducing new characters that are so unknown that they don't even feature in the Marvel Encyclopaedia and require a search to the deepest parts of the internet to understand where they have come from. Why not make a film to show how The Avengers are building a new team as a result of their losses? It just seems daft to me.There was a musical piece in the middle of the film and like that, I would describe this film as a cacophony. It was all too much going on, here, there and everywhere and with too many people. There weren't enough pauses and there were too many explosions, Etc. It is fantastic what can be achieved on a computer, but this just felt like the artists had finally been given a chance to use colours that would normally be left in the paintbox, because they were so unrealistic.I think that Dr Strange, played by Benedict Cumberbatch, worked nicely as part of an ensemble cast, such as he did in 'Infinity War' and 'Endgame' but he just jars a bit in the character's own stories.

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8195395/?ref_=tturv_perm_71,Another Marvel,"In so many ways this is what you'd expect. Nonstop action and appearances from as many Marvel heroes as possible. The surprise might have been twofold. 1) Different faces than you might expect on a couple of them; and 2) the inclusion of characters from other Marvel franchises. The latter is not so much of a surprise and the former is clever.There is not much I can add to over 2.5K other reviews, so I will throw in a couple of random thoughts I had.During one of the transfer scenes my mind conjured the thought that this would fit into a Sixties LSD trip quite easily. Almost on top of that, my mind wondered if the director told the special effects artists to create a bunch of fantastical scenes at random and then they would figure how to fit them into the story. These were random impressions and not meant as realistic criticisms plus or minus.Another more concrete thought revolved around the use of multiverses. Endgame used time travel to throw all the normal rules out the window. Some great character once said ""I hate time travel"" or something similar. Multiverses is another way to throw all the rules out the window. That and giving the villain almost unlimited power with no cost or consequences to its use. Marvel seems to excel at this last point.",1,1,Jackbv123,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur54314810/?ref_=tturv_usr_71_t,1-Jun-22,6,/10,
https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8264734/?ref_=tturv_perm_72,My expectations weren't met,"A movie solely dedicated to Dr. Stephen Strange had one Wanda Maximoff aka Scarlet Witch in it who not only stole the invaluable limelight from our main 'protagonist', but she also had most of the intriguing sequences to her name, where she was able to break out of her shell and flaunt her true powers and abilities.Doesn't it feel strange (no pun intended) though?I mean, yes, we all were aware that this stand-off would eventually take place at one point and I'm delighted it did; even though, I must admit, to see this legendary battle being almost one-sided was a little bit unexpected. Look, I for one, have always felt sorry for Wanda for what had happened to her. I sympathize with her for all the tragic losses she had to endure; while her actions aren't reasonable, at the same, I could understand her pain as well as her reckless mindset.But to witness her getting too overpowered doesn't provide me any sense of fulfillment, shockingly so! It's rather perplexing to watch her snuff off mightier fighters from another universe in a split second like they mean nothing! And let me remind you, those were not any other ordinary beings, they were the mightiest superheroes in their world!Speaking of worlds, they had a fascinating subject like Multiverse in their hands with an abundance of possibilities and paths to delve into yet what did they do? They opted for the banalest course possible! It's freaking parallel universes we are talking of, it was meant to be grand, and eloquent in every possible way but instead, what have we got?

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9034076/?ref_=tturv_perm_73,Solid Return for Raimi to Horror,"This is a movie that I wanted to catch in the theater, especially since I heard this was considered horror. I couldn't make it work though and I was behind at the time on watching the Marvel properties. Jaime was interested in jumping into this one since she liked the original Doctor Strange movie. We watched this together. I should also say I was stoked to see director Sam Raimi come back to the genre as well.Synopsis: Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) teams up with a mysterious teenage girl from his dreams who can travel across the multiverse to battle multiple threats. They seek out the aid of Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen), Wong (Benedict Wong) and others.We start this by seeing Doctor Stephen Strange helping America Chavez (Xochitl Gomez) get away from a monster. She has an interesting power that the monster is after. Things don't end well for this Dr. Strange, but America gets away through a star shaped portal.Dr. Strange then wakes up. He thinks it is a nightmare. He soon finds out that isn't the case. What he was seeing was another version of himself in the multiverse. He helps America fight off another monster and Wong shows up to help. They know that someone is using witchcraft. This causes Dr. Strange to seek out the aid of Wanda aka The Scarlet Witch.Things don't go as planned there. Dr. Strange and America jump through different multiverses and even end up in a different one where Dr. Christine Palmer (Rachel McAdams) works for a secret group. Things played out differently here. There is a great power that if The Scarlet Witch can obtain this power that America has. Wanda wants something that she had during the events of WandaVision.That is where I'm going to leave my recap of the story and the characters. There is more that I'm leaving out, but I don't want to spoil this one. Where I want to start is that I'm glad Jaime and I watched Spider-Man: No Way Home before this. That introduces more of the multiverse ideas that were introduced through Ant-Man and the Wasp and even Avengers: Endgame. I'm a sucker for multiverse stuff as it makes more sense to me than religion. This one builds on what No Way Home did where the characters from there came to that version of Earth where we are seeing other variations here. That was good.I think this idea is a big part of how this continues into other Marvel Cinematic Universe stuff going forward. I've been questioning what they were going to do with the main villain defeated. We need to have something greater to contend with. There have been a few things that I've seen from the television shows, but I'm still a couple movies back. It has me intrigued for sure. As an update, I'm just one movie that is out back and I'm still curious as to what they'll do.Where I'll then go would be the horror elements and our villain. There is a character from WandaVision that was introduced. That drew me to where it would go. I do believe that character is getting their own show or movie, something along those lines. What it did though is set up that The Scarlet Witch has the capacity to be evil. She lost Vision to Thanos. Sorry if this is a spoiler. There are also children that she loves but aren't hers. I like seeing this power character who switched to being good could become a great adversary again as she realizes more powers. Bringing up the horror elements, we have Raimi directing. This was his bread and butter. The elements are light as this is a mainstream movie. We do get a zombie in theory. This also goes dark with the number of characters killed. It does step into the genre.Now I'm not sure if there is more to go into here so let me shift over to the acting. We have a great cast. Cumberbatch is great as Dr. Strange. He brings an arrogance to the role that works. Olsen is also wonderful as this character. I'll leave it there. Gomez is solid as this younger character trying to navigate things much larger than her. I liked to see Chiwetel Ejiofor come back as Baron Mordo. Wong is solid along with McAdams, Hayley Atwell, John Krasinski, Patrick Stewart and even Charlize Theron. The implications for some of these characters has me excited for the future. The multiverse does a lot there. We also got a Bruce Campbell cameo that I loved.All that is left to go into would be filmmaking. This has good cinematography. It doesn't necessarily have that Raimi feel that I grew up and love. I think he still does an excellent job though to capture that we are in different variations of something that is familiar. I give credit to that. The effects are good. This is CGI heavy, but I expect that. It does look good thanks to the Disney money. Other than that, I'd say that the soundtrack fit for what was needed.In conclusion, I liked what this movie was doing. I'm glad to see Raimi come back to the genre, even though it is light on those elements. What really works here though are the multiverse aspects and the implications that come from there. It uses things that I saw in the What If...? MCU show, we have potential for this universe to keep getting better. The acting is good. This is a well-made movie. I'm probably giving this a bit higher score due to it flirting with the genre more. I enjoyed my time with this one for sure.My Rating: 7 out of 10.",4,2,Reviews_of_the_Dead,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur23318905/?ref_=tturv_usr_73_t,5-May-23,7,/10,

The climax of the film is also decent.Acting is good and Elizabeth Olsen was magnificent in her role. Benedict Cumberbatch was decent and could've been little more effective.

Elizabeth Olsen gets to continue the more layered development of Wanda started in WandaVision in extremely satisfying ways.Benedict Wong is still instantly loveable as Wong and Rachel McAdams increased screen time is much appreciated. Xochitl Gómez makes a great first impression with a charming and likeable character who's easy to root for.Thankfully, Sam Raimi's unique voice and style have not been lost in the franchise's often bland filmmaking, instead delivering a film that's visually striking and kinetic in ways no other Marvel film has been. His horror roots are also on display in some very satisfying ways.The action benefits greatly from the ridiculous inventiveness of it all so no fight feels lazy and generic. Danny Elfman's score is a definite standout, really unique and fun but isn't afraid to reference some classic Marvel themes in clever ways.The film is only brought down by a collection of nitpicks at best. The CG has a few weak points despite being really impressive overall. The fast pace works really well but takes a scene or two to adjust and a few narrative beats may require a suspension of disbelief that's too much for some.",109,97,masonsaul,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur94560739/?ref_=tturv_usr_77_t,5-May-22,9,/10,

Very curious what they were. The movie starts off great, its fun and funny as we catch up with Stephen Strange far more than his role in spider-Man No Way Home. The action starts quickly which was great, but then we get to the point where I feel the movie gets loop sided.A lot of scenes were stretched out and far too slow and what made that really bad was that these scenes were meaningless. If you went to see this movie with a die-hard marvel fan you probably think you miss something person picked up, but I'm telling you right now, a lot of scenes were slow for suspense that was not needed.Then we had a lot of scenes that went by far too fast, and these scenes should have more meaning than they should. There was a reason why we went to see Multiverse of Madness and that reason could have had more meat. Yeah, it was awesome, but not on the three Spider-Men in one film big.Speaking of Spider-man, there was a point in the flick in which Sam Rami does his thing to the point that I wish this movie was called Dr. Strange and the Evil Dead. I feel like I learned something about how a marvel movie was produced. It seemed obvious that this part of the movie was producer Kevin Feige developing the universe he created, while this part of the movie was the part in which Feige allowed Sam Raimi (the man showed Marvel how to make a superhero movie and thus the reason why Feige has a job) do what he does best, and of course this was the best part of the movie as Raimi put his stank on it, but I needed more of the funk.Could have also used more Scarlet Witch then what was given. It does not hurt that for the Scarlet witch to truly work in this flick you needed to have scene WandaVison. That was kinda a flaw because of how important she was to the story. She just was not fanfare, that you really did not need to understand the movie. On top of that you kind of needed to see the other Disney + series What If? For the fan fare to truly hit you. Not that important but that fan fare is why a lot of people what to see this particular entry in the marvel cinematic universe, right?Don't let me discourage you form seeing it. It's good, and I'm glad I saw it once, but it does not feel like something I going to want to watch 100 times before it leaves theatres.",53,42,subxerogravity,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur59627333/?ref_=tturv_usr_79_t,7-May-22,8,/10,

Several realities, in fact, as the title should inform. While fighting to derail the latest dark, magical threat to our universe, Strange and company are sucked through a portal and tread upon dozens of similar, but distinct, versions of the MCU.This serves as a fantastic excuse to get creative, with the brains behind the project energized by the chance... no, the directive... to be as crazy and weird as they wanna be, without the worry of resetting any pieces after the game's through. When you've got a closet full of Dr. Strange variations, the essential mandate that Dr. Strange must survive the latest Dr. Strange flick doesn't really hold water. Of course, there are ethical questions involved with all this - at least, from the characters' perspectives - but to a large degree, it feels like a loosening of the handcuffs.Unfortunately, those freer stakes also make everything seem more artificial and trivial. The film appears to sense this, fighting to retain a degree of importance despite dozens of major, throwaway onscreen deaths, but isn't quite crafty enough shoot the gap. Instead, the pacing suffers for the attempt. An editor's nightmare, Multiverse of Madness is prone to long periods of lush, exciting visual concepts, followed by equally long periods of dull, plodding exposition and glacial character development. It's fun, actually lots of fun in shorter bursts, but very thin and entirely too long. And, while the geek in me appreciates just how thoroughly Marvel Comics the whole premise looks, acts and feels, I fear it's wandered too far from what made the MCU's earlier films so successful.",1,1,drqshadow-reviews,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur26266323/?ref_=tturv_usr_86_t,4-Aug-22,5,/10,

I guarantee the suits got involved a toned down what Raimi probably really wanted but .......Sam Raimi is back in full horror mode ""to best of his ability"" with the MCU's latest installment , Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. This is a very different Marvel movie than whatever has come before it in both tone, action, and comedy, all hailing from the maestro of comedy-horror movies ,Sam Raimi. Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness echo creative choices from Raimi's The Evil Dead films, Army of Darkness, Darkman, and even Drag Me To Hell. I own all four films on Blu-ray disc. This movie is sensory overload to watch it all unfold. If you like your science fiction with a heavy dose of first class CGI , it is mind blowing in this film.This sequel takes place a few months after the events of Spider-Man: No Way Home that follows Doctor Strange crossing paths with a young woman named American Chavez (Xochitl Gomez), who has a super unique power that catches the eyes of every one of the Mystic Arts. Xochitl Gomez is a scene stealer !It turns out that there is an evil demon hot on her pursuit that wants to drain her power and take over all universes. This sets the course for Doctor Strange and America to travel the multi-verse in search of safety and an ancient book the Darkhold (Classic Raimi ! Remember the Necronomicon in the Evil Dead film series) that might be the key to stopping this evil.There are some great characters and cameos that show up, along with Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) back in action since her stint on the popular Wanda Vision Disney+ TV show. Raimi uses these cameos well and is not just a one-note, few-second reveal. I do not watch trailers if I don't have to or read reviews I like to go in blind to most movies I see , so I was tickled pink with some of the nostalgic cameos it really was well done. One in particular was over the top for me as a fan of her work. I will just reveal one ,like any one on this forum really cares anyway or my thought for that matter indulge me . Wait till you see Haylay Atwell's bad a s s costume !You will just have to watch the movie to see all of the nods and winks that Raimi packs into this film.Doctor Strange may have gotten top billing but this is just as much a movie about Wanda Maximoff of Earth 616 (aka the main MCU) , and (Elizabeth Olsen) came to play ! She was the highlight of the film. Olson turned on the her dark and brooding; not afraid to get bloodstained. Did she ever look fabulous on the IMAX screen is (approximately 62 by 82 feet) in 3D no less.This film has many things going for it . It is outside the box far from the formulaic and usual pattern of a movie in the MCU , amazing production value , very talented cast chalked full of fun cameos and fan service . Action-packed sequences, dives deep into multitude of multiverses . Sam Raimi's direction is tight with a more visceral approach. Most of all this is an entertaining piece of Sci-fi most fans of the genre should enjoy.And mid credit scene had a very nice Cameo surprise !",16,21,robfollower,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur78277499/?ref_=tturv_usr_90_t,7-May-22,8,/10,

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8497726/?ref_=tturv_perm_92,Solid entertainment,"Dr. Strange in the Multiverse of Madness looked and felt like a proper MCU film. The story ran at a fast pace. The set-ups happened one on top of the other and fight scenes were frequent in between the narrative expositions. The character arcs in the film were interesting indeed. But as much as the film has Dr. Strange as the main protagonist, it was Wanda's film as it really gave her a huge amount of focus. It felt as though somehow Dr Strange took a backseat in favor of America and Wanda. He was still pretty cool using his magic, but he did not have the same impact from before. The way Multiverse of Madness handled the concept of multiverse was satisfying. There are cameos of alternate versions of characters that appeared in the film. Among them are two of the most anticipated characters to appear in the MCU. It is arguable that the way they were utilized was undermining. The film set pieces were also definitely a Marvel product. It was complete with big CGI background and fights and colorful production set. But it is noteworthy how good the transition was in the scene where Strange and America travel to different universes. Everything happened in mere seconds yet so many things were presented. Kudos to the visual effects and editing team for that scene. As far as performance go, Benedict Cumberbatch and Elizabeth Olsen were the stand outs. On the whole, MoM worked as a standalone film with only minimum references to other MCU films. It may not drive the audiences to madness, but it would surely give them a solid fun watch.",0,2,Abdulxoxo,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur106279729/?ref_=tturv_usr_92_t,29-Aug-22,7,/10,
https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8263309/?ref_=tturv_perm_93,"Has its moments and is visually gorgeous, but the screenplay is lacking! [+62%]","The refreshing aspect here is Sam Raimi's goth-horror take on the visuals. There are a couple of Sam Raimi's signature jumpscares alongside a fun Bruce Campbell cameo. But the screenplay can't match up to his vision - it's, at times, too simple (like the antagonist's motive is weak) and convoluted (with the multiverse narrative) at others. The MCU cameos ultimately end up not meaning much since they already establish that all characters have their distinct versions in other universes, and the resolution to the film's central problem isn't as smooth as I'd have liked. Elizabeth Olsen is certainly having fun playing Wanda/Scarlet Witch, while Cumberbatch occasionally takes a backseat for the former's arc to play out.The standout scene was certainly the takeover of Kamar-Taj. It's visually epic, and supported by stupendous production design and CGI. The climactic set-piece, on the other hand, looks a bit watered down - maybe due to the horror elements present. The 2-hour film almost breezes past, leaving almost no room for subplots. It expects the viewer to have watched No Way Home and WandaVision, so they don't have to explain the current state of affairs all that much. The mid-credits scene intrigues with a key character addition, though I'm not sure it adds a lot of excitement.",1,1,arungeorge13,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur30872044/?ref_=tturv_usr_93_t,22-Jun-22,6,/10,

Little things like the musical fight or Raimi's dry sense of humor with the horror elements stay with you and make the film alive. But this isn't a film unto itself. Instead it is a episode-of mostly set-up with little payoff-of the TV show masquerading as a film series.The MCU continues to prove Scorsese right with each new piece of subcinema that gets released.,5,2,CubsandCulture,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur83822756/?ref_=tturv_usr_94_t,9-Aug-22,6,/10,

Well, the last actually does have a reference, but it is not what you think.But everything that helped make WandaVision practically TV History was missing from this. That was a huge missed opportunity.Although I did enjoy the alternates and cameos that show up in this, Those fringe characters from WandaVision could have made this great. And so I found the story highlighting The Scarlett Witch slightly disappointing.But it is a Sam Raimi film with standard Bruce Campbell cameo, and it did include some ""evil dead"" elements. Not saying what those are, watch it, you'll see.The way this affects Doctor Strange is also very interesting.However, the resolution of this story would make any continuation of WandaVision difficult. Which was a story that deserved more.There was magnificent imagery, and at least two Non-DC references to Starro. There was one Starro reference in Infinity wars toward the end of the fim. And so it was just fitting there were two references here.So, I am just going to rate it 10, because I did like what was there. Mostly because of Sam Raimi's tendency to give us what we want, but not what we expect.There were a few mind bending revelations. This film was totally off the rails very early on, and then they even packed up the rails and rolled them away.

Two hours of her whining and psycho BS were a drag, but at least the end made up for that.Doctor Strange seemed to be in automatic mode. Sometimes he energized his role and seemed really into it. Other times he seemed to be playing Sherlock Holmes. I think Benedict Cumberbatch has gotten a bit too cozy as playing Dr. Strange the same all the time, and is not adding in much of his real personality or anything unique or warm about himself.When talking with America at the end, when she is thanking him as he walks away, Strange brushes her off, like it is all in a day's work. Strange was very cold to her, even though during the movie he did so much to treat her right and show her that he cared.Perhaps the best part of this movie comes at the end, when we see the Eye of Agamoto and Clea finally shows up, in all her glory.",8,5,Cobra_77,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur57178464/?ref_=tturv_usr_97_t,3-Jul-22,10,/10,

What I liked about Dr. Strange in the first movie was his arc--how he went from a guy who was only looking out for himself to using his abilities to protect others. In this movie, Stephen Strange doesn't really change much. It was also kind of tiresome to spend a whole movie watching Wanda try to get her fake kids back after everything that happened in the WandaVision series. I feel like that was the wrong story to tell because it felt like she would have learned from those mistakes instead of going further off the deep end.

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8134767/?ref_=tturv_perm_101,"Not Only Exciting, This Film Is Also Heartwarming, As The Characters Show The Viewers The True Importance Of Love.","The thrilling Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, written by Michael Waldron, keeps you on the edge of your seat-you silently root for Dr. Strange as he embarks on the daunting journey to save America Chavez. Not only exciting, this film is also heartwarming, as the characters show the viewers the true importance of love. The acting is emotional and grounded in reality, even though the Marvel world is fantastical. Marvel fans will be fully engaged as they travel through the endless and unknown multiverse with Stephen Strange.The storyline follows Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) as he tries to save America Chavez's (Xochitl Gomez) powers from being stolen by the indomitable Wanda, the Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen.) The unlikely duo must travel deep through the uncharted multiverse in order to defeat Wanda, but along the way, how will Strange and Chavez overcome the seemingly impassable obstacles that they will inevitably face? Wanda just wants her children back, but how much is she willing to sacrifice and destroy in order to return to her content family life?As usual, Benedict Cumberbatch portrays Stephen Strange's beautiful complexity with ease, making his work seem simple. I forget he is even acting. To me he is truly Doctor Strange. Xotchil Gomez, although new to the Marvel Universe, starts off with a bang. She acts in a relatable and comical way, and it is impossible not to root for her with every step. The CGI is scarily realistic and absolutely essential to the story. The marvelous monsters are gruesome, each universe is unique and colorful, and the fight scenes are powerful-all because of the CGI. The music in this movie, by composer Danny Elfman, makes the action even more dramatic and gives the audience a pump of anticipation and adrenaline. Music even plays a pivotal role in one scene as it becomes a tool and a weapon in battle. My favorite part of the movie is the first time Dr. Strange travels with America to a new universe and experiences wonder and fright and ultimately awe.The message of this film is that love is the most powerful kind of magic. One may be strong or supernatural, but familial love comes before any other superpower. This message is beautiful, relatable, and uplifting, especially for those of us who miss someone we truly love. The film starts really quickly and immediately draws the viewers into to the plot, but there are many macabre scenes that may be frightening to a younger audience.I give Doctor Strange, into the Multiverse of Madness 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 10-18, plus adults.

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8375004/?ref_=tturv_perm_102,Doc Strange 2,"So, COVID may not have killed the MCU entirely but to horribly paraphrase Whiplash from Iron Man 2, COVID made Marvel bleed and I'm starting to lose my belief in them.Dr Strange 2: Multiverse Boogaloo, while not a bad movie was just terribly... Meh. It may be one of the most poorly paced films I've seen in the MCU, which is something. The movie feels like its about 3 hours long and yet it doesn't take the time to really live in any of the moments I would like it to. I'm not feeling like any of these big character movements are really earned or make sense. Even the CGI is... It's fine? At some points its really good and at others you'd forget that this is the bajillion dollar money making franchise and for such an effects driven movie, having those effects not work is death.This is tough for me. As a long time MCU fan, I just can't help but feel they're losing a step in the post-COVID world. Black Widow was a mess, Spider-Man was a blast but isn't sticking with me the way I'd like it to and lets just not even talk about Eternals. Maybe it's just the shift to Disney+ and their lineup of great shows. Maybe this is the time where we stop having such expectations for the movies and start putting attention back to the series. I know I was way more captivated during Wandavision, Loki, Falcon, Hawkeye and What If than I was for anything going on here.Conversely, maybe Doc Strange just isn't my jam. First one wasn't anything spectacular to me either, maybe I shouldn't expect greatness from this.

Even the very title is a reference to the novel ""In The Mountains Of Madness"". Danny Elfman's soundtrack is wonderful, giving the film a good atmosphere. The script is somewhat questionable that I could leave doubts, but when it comes to the multiverse, there is no room for logic. Strange doesn't get to do much and it's surprising that Wanda becomes the antagonist for being corrupted by the Darkhole which uses Wanda's great weakness which is the desire to have a family. It may not be what some expected, but without a doubt this movie is another great start to explore the multiverse and that's why I rate it a 10/10.",6,4,Elvis-Del-Valle,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur139621299/?ref_=tturv_usr_103_t,22-Mar-23,10,/10,

Doctor Strange mistakenly departs from this tried and true strategy and gives a rather mixed and dark sort of film. After seeing the potential and creativity in the multiverse concept with Spiderman I had high expectations for Doctor Strange. Sadly I saw a dull, slow and average film.It also proves that some characters might be better supporting heroes instead of leads. Doctor Strange is great when he is part of a team and entertains us for his parts in the film but on his own he leaves a lot to be desired.

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8118461/?ref_=tturv_perm_105,Elizabeth Olson and Raimi shine in a fun and exciting sequel,"Being a huge fan of the first Doctor Strange film, one that definitely didn't get enough attention in my opinion, and legendary director Sam Raimi- it was clear to me that Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness was gonna be one hell of a ride- and thank god it was. The film is rather loose with its story, but it also provides a anti-typical narrative that does prove to be quite interesting and quite different than the usual Marvel schlock we have come to see from more recent films like Black Widow- though never being as pretentious or lengthy as Marvel Eternals. Where Multiverse of Madness works and the other fails, is its ability to take its audience fully into the insane experience at hand, never letting go for a second and devoting its all to every crazy moment it can. The acting is great, as I expected, Benedict Cumberbatch is again great as Doctor Strange- but even with him being the titular character- it's very clear that Elizabeth Olson as Wanda or ""The Scarlet Witch"" is clearly the biggest standout in the film altogether. Olson ties the film together in a way I didn't expect, and ties the film to a rather emotional and psychological core that is sure to please all fans of her character and devoted fans of the show WandaVision. In addition to Olson and Cumberbatch, the supporting cast also does great, especially newcomer Xochitl Gomez and the returning Rachel McAdams. The cameos can be a bit underwhelming, nothing too special or grand as some other projects. The visuals are often incredible, and thanks to Raimi's signature style- brilliantly dark and even gothic at times- and the special effects are often fun and vibrant- although it is quite silly to see that half done photoshopped eye on Doctor Strange a few times. The music is honestly fantastic, a brilliant score from genius Danny Elfman, both haunting and exciting in the best possible way. In the end, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness may not be as even or brilliant as the original- but it does a great job of enrapturing us in new worlds and embracing us in grand new ways with the characters we have grown to love- and some new ones as well.My Rating: 9.3/10.",76,69,Allierubystein666,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur48282208/?ref_=tturv_usr_105_t,5-May-22,9,/10,
https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8119143/?ref_=tturv_perm_106,"Mad Cameos, Mad Fan Service, And Missing Full Story Magic","LIKES:The Acting: When it comes to the performances, so many solid pieces came together to bring another solid performance in this Marvel installment. Ejiofor, when he is in it, enjoys a nice reprieve of his role, adding the same honor, mystery, and values that we got in the first, only with a little twist. He is funny, he makes a great banter, and he is timed well when he is used, leading to a great inclusion. Olsen hits hard in the emotional feels of this movie, taking what we loved in WandaVision and adding some more layers to help flesh it out, Olson takes the Scarlet Witch to new heights. Fans should enjoy the character development components with it, while relishing in the abilities that the strong character wields. The way she delivered the lines, the emotional flair, while also really bringing that edge to the combat skills. As for Cumberbatch, he's the man, and I really enjoyed the take he brings to Stephen Strange in this second installment. He's witty, he's elegant, and can be vulnerable, and he manages to bring all of it in a nice balance that we love to see in our characters. Strange is very interesting, relatable, but still holds the qualities of the comic character keeping true to the direction Disney took with him long ago. Everyone else hits their roles well, and there is fantastic chemistry amidst most of them to win my two thumbs up, but... there are better moments to this movie.The Music: Danny Elfman always brings character to his work on movies, and this film is no exception. Strange's second feature has solid scores and remakes of Marvel themes and music you love to hear as they appear on screen with big reveals and moments. Props to whoever elevated the score to be utilized more than just background noise though, as the creativity with this music is top notch in how they take an already master score and make it have even more quality to it. That's all I can really say, so let's move on to.The Fan Service/Revelations: If you are part of the Marvel fanbase, one of the biggest things that get you stoked is when your favorite references sneak their way into the movie. Good news, the movie is loaded with stuff that fans will go ape for, in their introduction in this film, none of which I can reveal without ruining the movie. Regardless, the movie opens up the potential for a lot of things to come in our Disney verse in the near future and I for one enjoyed what the Multiverse has brought with this film, and I can only wonder what other films will work their way into the next Phase of the film line up.The Character Development/Emotion: It would not be Disney without some form of character moment put into the film, and again they succeeded in helping evolve the characters in their game of superhero tag. Strange himself has plenty of new avenues to explore, working towards the goal of growing in to a better person and sorcerer as he handles his ""demons."" While I did not tear up, I have to say there were some relevant arcs in this film that I respected, and enjoyed seeing those moments come to life in those deeper moments of the film.The Action...To Some Degree: For fans like me, action is a big part of the movie and Strange managed to bring some awesome moments to take their place in the hall of MCU fame. Raimi elevated the stakes and the tone of these fights, and delivered some amazing moves that will have fans clapping in excitement. As mentioned in the music section, the spells offer new levels of magical chaos to partake in, and they make for some wicked bouts of spellcasting, at least in some of the fights. Strange certainly dips into the pools of strategy and creativity, using a lot of things for weapons as he combats the obstacles that are put before him. It's fun, it's exciting, and it works well to spice up the usual tactics to fighting we've seen in the other films, while still sticking to the comic books that we as fans enjoy. A solid bout of work there.The Visuals By far, the best thing were the visuals and Strange's world once again really bringing the fantasy world to life as the journey through the dimensions unfolds. I'll admit, it's a bit CGI heavy, but Disney's budget has continued to help craft things we only dream about in mind or drawings with a decent realism to it. Want to see Strange portrayed in lots of artistic styles? You've got it in this film when they are going through the montage of Multiverse transitions. Want to see demons and monsters appear with their own horrific style? Again, this movie has managed to craft some great textures and animations to fight with. Want to see spells warp their way around in colorful arsenals and bend the fabrics of onscreen reality with some nice styles? I think I've made my point. In addition, the costumes, settings, and makeup they do at times are the thing cosplayers dream of owning, looking awesome as they once again bring our comic book worlds to life. A solid use of the technology and props, strange has loaded the MCU with plenty of service to animation and design to really get the cinema experience coming to life.DISLIKES:The Action to Some Other Degree: I like lots of the action, but I won't lie that there were some moments built up that did not deliver the punch I thought was coming. Dr. Strange had several fights with that suspense setting, the dark tone promising for fights that were going to have us on the edge of our seats. And yet, these moments sort of dropped to simple resolutions or kind of just dropped off, rather than hitting those sequences the first film did well at times. With the arsenal of spells at their fingertips, and the wisdom these fighters have, I had expected a little more time, dedication, and planning to unleash the full potential I wanted to see in this film. Not the worst, but certainly more fine tuning to really maximize on the MCU adventure.The Visuals a Little Over CGI: We know that it takes a lot of computer power to make these worlds be realistic and often they succeed in keeping the balance between fake and real. However, the CGI was a little too heavy at times for this movie that the illusion was a little more separated than what we have seen. The worlds and spells take a little more of the too smooth or too perfect movement, that it approached the phony levels we sometimes see. Not the worst at all, but again, some more time smoothing elements out to really give it that finesse.Some Characters Get to Shaft: You know from previous reviews that several big characters need to have their due if they are going to be built up. While this film accomplishes good use of the cameos and secondary roles, there are a few other people I feel needed more time to make their mark. Wong and Mordo are the two characters I find to be the most underutilized of the bunch when looking at the trailers. Sure, Wong has some okay screen time and some fantastic moments that show his powers, but there was more that could have been done to really give his involvement the full time in this hasty tale. As for Mordo, well, he's got his moments to be included, but don't let the trailers fool you... his involvement does not merit the full hype you might have. I can't say more than that, but this was a bit of a disappointment for me in the long run given what the trailers promised.The Story: By far the messiest of the movie dislikes for me is the story. No, it's not a piece of crap or misconstrued confusion (at least most of it isn't). However, the movie does feel a little crammed with so many points that several of the things I mentioned where short changed due to this chaotic inclusion. Several twists were not really that surprising or timed well, dropping the truth in seconds rather than really drawing things out and establishing the mystery. Hasty ties to the shows made their quick appearance and then sort of pulsed out, while character development attempts were sort of just dropped to make room for more fan service. Other potential story elements that were supposed to be more intense again felt bland and sort of smudged in, while other promises made by the trailer, were startling limited in their inclusion and execution. Even the ending moments to get us set for the next film felt weaker and less mind blowing and okay, rather than getting me hyped for the next film. This was the weakest element and I think balance was lacking somewhat again for what was needed.The VERDICT:
Our second trip into the world of Strange was certainly an interesting ordeal that opens up the way for Disney's purchases to come home. Special effects wise, it's stunning, a masterpiece for the most part of that animation and adventure we love to see in a Marvel movie. Acting is great and the characters that get good time, have some decent dives into the character pool to help you appreciate their struggles. However, the movie is lacking balance like the last crossing of dimensions, that though has the darker edge many have looked for, lacks the finesse the other movies have. It's story in particular is the weakest element for me, the foundation shaky that other sacrifices and compromises were made to help try and cover the weaker plot. Fan service and cameos took precedence over story sustenance, and even the action was a bit underwhelming at times as the plot points crashed. Still, the movie has enough magic to warrant aa visit to the theater and hopefully it will be entertaining for you fans on other levels to forgive the rougher elements. Note: Kids of the Marvel series are warned for the darker elements of this movie.My scores are:

Having Sam Raimi direct this movie was a clever idea, because the horror elements in the movie would only make sense if he were directing.Benedict Cumberbatch is great as Doctor Strange; throughout the movie you can get behind him and his problems that connect to the main plot. Elizabeth Olsen was excellent as Scarlet Witch/Wanda Maximoff; you feel for what she is going through, and you understand why she is doing what she is doing.I really liked the first appearance of Xochitl Gomez as America Chavez in this movie. I like how she struggles with her powers, and I love how she uses them to travel with Doctor Strange through the Multiverse, along with being able to relate with her.The horror elements were creepy and disturbing, and they keep doing that throughout the movie, especially the 3rd act. There were brutal death scenes that shocked me, which made me like the movie more because it pushes the PG-13 rating and lets Sam Raimi do what he wants with it.I loved the multiple universes they travel through, and I liked how they each had their own design with its different versions of the characters that we know. The cameos in the movie are awesome seeing and some of them are surprising to see.In the movie there are connections to the WandaVision (2021-2021) show and references to Marvel's What If...? (2021-2021) animated show. I am not saying you must watch them to understand the movie, but I recommend watching them, so you understand certain scenes in the movie.I had a lot of fun with this Doctor strange movie; it is one of the darker MCU films and I enjoyed every second of it.

Probably, that's something every MARVEL fan should do in order to be entertained during the current MARVEL phases. INFINITY WAR and ENDGAME days seem pretty far.I love Sam Raimi and i like what he's done here. Still a breath of fresh air. They should let him go even further, more Raimi-esque. If they can't impress the audience with their new stories, they should hire high acclaimed directors and let them do their thing. Producers should be bolder.First hour is pretty good. Then, it becomes kinda boring. There were times here that i didn't really care about what happened. (These ILLUMINATI minutes were laughable and flat). Judging by this movie's reputation, many people felt similar. However, last 30 minutes were good, movie went back on track. A somewhat strong ending saved this, at least for me. At first i didn't like Xochitl Gomez's acting and character, but in the end, i think she was a good choice. There are a lot of likeable characters here.Benedict Cumberbatch is still a very strong presence. Olsen was sufficient enough, i can't say that i loved her specific role here, her motives remained a bit of far fetched, but she made me invested. Wong is likeable as always.

Elizabeth Olsen shines as Wanda Maximoff, giving her all with raw force. The addition of Xochitl Gomez as America Chavez adds a new dimension to the story.Atmosphere and Visuals
The film is visually stunning, with Raimi's trademark whip pans, sudden tilts, zooms, and inside-out viewpoints. The use of special effects enhances the comic book-like atmosphere, making it visually appealing.Conclusion
""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness"" is a wild ride through the multiverse, full of mind-bending moments and trippy twists. Sam Raimi's headlong approach to storytelling occasionally leads the film astray, but it will please the legions of established fans with its embrace of comic book weirdness. The film is a singular vision of an MCU director, and it helps steady the Marvel ship with its frantic, on-the-edge-of-losing-control feel.Rating: 8/10.",0,1,drlex-15751,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur128266142/?ref_=tturv_usr_109_t,29-Oct-24,8,/10,

It is very fun, with some incredibly cool moments, and it's a very solid instalment into the MCU.We get to see Scarlet Witch let properly loose which is truly fantastic to watch. The film is its best when focusing on her, giving us a nice continuation of the WandaVision arc. As a result though I think the Doctor Strange character lost a bit, and he maybe felt a bit flat in comparison. Overall though a very enjoyable story with some great action.The direction from Raimi is very good. He injects his unique campy horror style, which is obviously watered down for a PG13 project, but makes for a very atmospheric and engaging film. Visually I thought it was a treat.As always with Marvel, there are some nice little surprises and cameos which set up some future branches of the MCU nicely.A solid and enjoyable film, but not quite top tier Marvel which I maybe thought it would be going into it.",5,6,ethanbresnett,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur114450253/?ref_=tturv_usr_111_t,8-May-22,7,/10,

her power).In our world, Stephen Strange awakens, gets dressed up, and heads to a wedding. After some less than happy chatting with a former doctor colleague, the wedding march begins, and see that Christine is the one getting married (😱).Outside the church, a portal opens and America comes through, closely followed by a 1 eyed octopus-like creature. Strange switches to his normal attire and quickly pursues the chaos, closely followed by Wong joining in the ruckus.Eventually Strange and Wong figure out that the cause of what's after America has nothing to do with them. It's witchcraft! So Strange decides to go and see the witch he knows.We last saw Wanda at the end of WandaVision where she was hearing the voices of her two boys (that were never actually real in our world).

Something-ness,"Doctor Strange 2 is the MCU's latest balls-to-the-wall crossover event, and it's noticeably not as well done as everything else was in Spider-Man: No Way Home. The effects and action are nice, but the story squanders a palpable script in favour of frustratingly fragmented (which multiverses can suffer from when stories don't address all the inherent issues of multiple worlds directly interacting with each other) fan-service and even more sequel-fodder with its abrupt cliff-hanger ending (pre-post-creds mind you, but still).Doctor Strange 2 covers its concept of multiverses instead of telling a re-inventive character-driven story like Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse had. Doctor Strange 2's got splashes of self-aware humour here and there, but it's gonna have to take some magic to become a film comparable to the MCU's stronger entries.The most notable thing about the film is how many opportunities it squanders with its many supporting characters introduced and then never really getting utilised in the story (except for one). It teases endless narrative possibilities courtesy of the last Spider-Man movie doing so with its lead, but Doctor Strange 2 teases fan service only to deliver shortcomings instead of going all the way with its promise of 'madness' in the title. The good stuff IS there; it just doesn't have enough story-breathing-room in the film.Doctor Strange 2 is definitely a noble attempt at something 'new' for the MCU, and it's sure as hell more confident than Eternals, but it suffers the same character-squandering issues as it.With a universe as vast as Marvel's, not every entry in the MCU was guaranteed to work.

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8148277/?ref_=tturv_perm_132,A Seriously Superb and Creative Concept Executed Blandly,"Sometimes alike but also usually unalike most of the Avengers superhero movies in the MCU, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is a giant mess. It's especially disappointing since its 2016 predecessor was surprisingly a blast; it featured a talented neurosurgeon who lost the ability to use his hands properly after a car crash, following towards some solid drama and his entertaining journey to becoming a superhero. The Multiverse of Madness understandably isn't that, and shouldn't just be a sequel that watches the first film before its new story, but its just too chaotic.You would probably find the film a lot more enjoyable if you properly read and understood what it was actually about, because the trailer was just convoluted and the film is actually about Doctor Strange opening a portal to the multiverse that includes alternate versions of himself, other people and lifestyle. Even for a 2 hour movie, this film feels very rushed, overly pacy and it just ends up convoluted in the way the multiverse works and what happens. It's definitely entertaining and really engages you, but you probably need to go and break down the story to understand it.The action battle between Doctor Strange and the octopus-alien monster really gets you engaged, but all of the action is very loud and too rushed. It's alike Marvel movies for using the same predictable basis Marvel creates for superheroes, meaning big fans of Marvel will probably really enjoy it. This movie mostly deserves points for its new characters and the whole idea of Doctor Strange entering the multiverse (of madness). The characters are executed well and wisely use the talents of a brilliant cast, but the concept is just too rushed and could use some times to stop and take a breath. It's also worth noting that Sam Raimi uses lots of horror scenes and jump-scares throughout this movie, so it's much scarier than other Marvel blockbusters.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",68,51,Zac_La_Porte,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur132809519/?ref_=tturv_usr_132_t,16-May-22,5,/10,

Doctor Strange joins forces with America Chavez(Xochitl Gomez), who can travel across universes, to battle several threats within the multiverse. They also ask Wanda Maximoff(Elizabeth Olsen) & Wong(Benedict Wong) to help them out.Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is an awe-inspiring film. Director Sam Raimi has successfully taken over directorial duties from Doctor Strange(2016) director, Scott Derrickson. This definitely feels like the Marvel Cinematic Universe's first horror movie. I also got the feeling that this is a Sam Raimi film, with all the homages to his iconic Evil Dead franchise. The action set pieces are jaw-dropping. The visual effects are fantastic. The 3D is eye-popping, especially in IMAX. The humor is on point, like it always is with Marvel. I had unrealistically high expectations for this movie, after Spider-Man: No Way Home(2021). First & foremost, this is primarily a Doctor Strange(2016) sequel & a follow-up to WandaVision(2021). There are quite a few memorable cameos but, don't expect anyone & everyone to show up. Also, some crucial cliffhangers from Doctor Strange's previous adventures don't get resolved, which is quite frustrating. Benedict Cumberbatch is spectacular as Doctor Stephen Strange. Elizabeth Olsen is outstanding as Wanda Maximoff/The Scarlet Witch. Cumberbatch & Olsen's unforgettable performances, are the highlight of the film. Chiwetel Ejiofor is great as Baron Mordo.

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8118535/?ref_=tturv_perm_138,"""Este güey no sabe español?""","1st : Highly recommend watching Wanda+Vision. Knowing what happened in Spider-Man's latest entry helps. Even if the Director didn't.. the writers must have.2nd : Has a few elements that force you to consider watching early, if you don't want to step away from the internet and the inevitable spoilers! Although they don't really add much to the core story of the movie, aside from being a set-piece and a ""bump on the road"". Noticeably fabricated to make people talk and want to watch.Anyway, I'm conflicted!It's definitely worth a watch if you still care about this universe. It's well crafted, acted and shot (some interesting camera angles here and there)! They properly told the story they wanted to tell (it being great is another story). At the same time, many things left me wanting more and others utterly disappointed. While it isn't as ""skippable"" as Eternals or Cap Marvel, and doesn't follow the known formula.. I'm not interested in watching it again any time soon! Maybe it's my fault for expecting ""more"". I would have liked the NEXT step in the evolution of Dr Strange, and less of the ""same"".MAGIC & PROGRESS - It feels like there has been little progress in the mage's skills, as if we are continuing exactly from where we left off. Magic is used sparsely and with limited results. I would expect our Doctor Strange to feel powerful at this point! But it's like he came out of graduation and barely has any field experience. There's too many pauses, casting time, and ridiculous childish spells.. like summoning a pair of demonic hands to grab a street-pole to whack someone! This to me is the worst part.. Strange felt incompetent at the start (stumbling through Magic), and then again in No Way Home, and now in this Madness.STORY - While a bit chaotic, it's easily followed. Doesn't leave much to the imagination, and doesn't do anything new or mind-bending. If anything, it was probably made without a real plan, and for general audiences to enjoy. The few nods here and there aren't really enough for fans to go crazy over.. unless they are superficial and easily pleased. It does introduce a new character in America Chavez, but it's still very introspective on the character of Stephen (and ruining Wanda). It slightly deals with a few new topics (some reminiscent of a ""What If"" episode), but the arc doesn't feel earned or advanced in the end. All in all, it feels too humane and grounded.OTHER - Music usage and forced-horror elements are WAY too crafted and noticeable at times, which takes away from the experience. At no point did I feel tense or scared. It's kind of childish, even! I also felt the movie slowed down for no reason (a certain tunnel scene).Finally, the VILLAIN. Wanda works as a scale to compare with Strange's growth, making the lack of new skills even more noticeable.. You could even say her appearance overshadows the main cast.Personally, didn't like one bit what they did with her character, as it feels like a development from an alternate universe instead of something that would happen to the version we are to care about. While it was different and unexpected, it felt shallow and directionless. I ask myself if they allowed the writers and Raimi to do whatever they wanted.. as a part of me thinks Marvel finally lost hold of reins of their horse, and it is doing whatever now.I'm sure people will like it. But I walked out thinking I would have seen this at home, no problem. And may that speak for itself.",20,18,daisukereds,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur26579233/?ref_=tturv_usr_138_t,5-May-22,5,/10,

Sam Raimi's distinctive visual style worked for that movie and its two sequels (Spider-Man 2 (2004) of course being one of the best ever made). This is what makes Raimi's return to the superhero genre exciting in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2022). Nostalgia is a heck of a drug, after all.What was interesting with this Doctor Strange (2016) sequel was how Marvel allowed Raimi to connect to more of his roots in the horror genre. The scariest scene in the original Spider-Man trilogy was in the operating room with Doctor Octopus (Alfred Molina). In contrast, the amount of horrific things shown in this movie creeps closer to his Evil Dead trilogy. Nothing so bad as to earn an R-rating, but still pretty intense for the MCU. Ultimately, he was the right director for this film, considering how much evil lies just outside the boundaries of Doctor Strange's powers and influence.While I'm a moderate fan of Marvel, having seen a lot of the 90s TV shows, but read none of the comics, Multiverse of Madness feels like it's showing the cracks in the MCU. Cameo appearances are great since they hint at what Marvel can do in future movies now that they own more of the rights to these characters. However, connecting the motives of this film's villain to a TV show that's effectively behind a paywall is likely frustrating for fans who feel like they're potentially missing out on key MCU story beats. And the only story this movie brings to the table is the potential for more stories. That's it.A great return to form for Sam Raimi despite exposing flaws in the MCU, I give Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness 3.5 stars out of 5.",1,2,Benjamin-M-Weilert,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur100116496/?ref_=tturv_usr_141_t,5-Aug-22,7,/10,

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8129222/?ref_=tturv_perm_143,Fun with heart,"Doctor Strange is my favorite Marvel character. This comes from my college days when one of my roommates had a stack of Dr. Strange comics and I tore through them - one of the few Marvel comics that I have actually read. So I was thrilled to find out that Sam Raimi was coming back (was he ever gone?) to direct the 2nd solo Dr. Strange film, DOCTOR STRANGE IN THE MULTIVERSE OF MADNESS.And it does not disappoint for while DOCTOR STRANGE IN THE MULTIVERSE OF MADNESS is not quite as ""mad"" as one would expect by the build up to this film, it delivers solid action by actors playing characters that are easy to root for (or root against) all done with a wink in the eye and a focus on Marvel's secret weapon...relationships and heart.You will find no brooding ""dark knights"" in this one.Sprightly Directed by Sam Raimi (THE EVIL DEAD), Multiverse (as I will call it from here on out) finds our titular hero (Benedict Cumberbatch) connecting with - and working to save - a multiverse hopping heroine in the form of America Chavez (Xochitl Gomez) from an evil that wishes to drain her of her multiverse hopping powers.What happens next is a multiverse hopping action/adventure/horror/chase film that really shows off the cinematic sensibilities of Director Raimi who's mark is all over this film...for the better. Multiverse swerves really close to being a horror film, but, fortunately for it's box office fortunes, remains firmly in the action/adventure/superhero genre. Only a director like Raimi can ride this fine line as well as he has and it works for this film.Cumberbatch, of course, is terrific as Doctor Stephen Strange and he slides, comfortably, back into the cloak and sling-ring. Benedict Wong (Wong - The Sorcerer Supreme), Rachel McAdams (Dr. Christine Palmer) and Chiwetel Ejiofor (Baron Mordo) all reprise their characters from the first film and they all seem re-energized in their roles for this one while Xochitl Gomez makes a winning debut as America Chavez.But, make no mistake, the personae that steals this film is Elizabeth Olson as the grieving Wanda Maximoff/Scarlett Witch who Dr. Strange reaches out to when America Chavez falls into his lap. She is outstanding and is really the driving force here. It would not be a misnomer to say that this film easily could have been titled THE SCARLET WITCH IN THE MULTIVERSE OF MADNESS.My one quibble with this film is that it doesn't go to enough Multiverses to suit my tastes and is not quite as ""mad"" as one would hope - our hero does spend a rather large amount of time in one multiverse - but that is a minor issue and this one multiverse does bring many fun cameos...cameos that will not be spoiled here.Which brings up one last point. See this film, if you can, in a theater full of the aforementioned fanboys. The full house IMAX theater that I caught this film in went absolutely nuts when one specific person showed his/her face for their extended cameo and that was a very fun time.As is DOCTOR STRANGE IN THE MULTIVERSE OF MADNESS - it works well as a stand alone film, but if you want to do ""some homework"", check out the Disney+ TV Series WANDAVISION (essential), the first DOCTOR STRANGE movie (good background) and the animated Disney+ series MARVEL'S WHAT IF (some nice callbacks).And, of course, stay for the end credits...it sets up DOCTOR STRANGE 3, a film that can't get here soon enough.Letter Grade: A-8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",3,9,bankofmarquis,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur10919398/?ref_=tturv_usr_143_t,9-May-22,8,/10,
https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8120422/?ref_=tturv_perm_144,A Blast from Start to Finish,"I very much enjoyed the first Doctor Strange film and thought his character has made a nice progression thus far in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. With the events of Avengers: Infinity War, Avengers: Endgame, WandaVision, and Spider-Man: No Way Home, I was slightly concerned about this film being able to stand on its own. Now here's the thing, it doesn't, but I still thought it was great. In fact, I think it's an even more entertaining film than the first Doctor Strange. I would even go as far as saying it would be in my conversation of the better Marvel Cinematic Universe films. Here's why, as long as you're caught up on the connected properties, this one is more than worth your time.Picking up after the events of Spider-Man: No Way Home and WandaVision, both of which laid the groundwork for how the multiverse is talked about in this film, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness takes no time at all before it dives right into the action/madness. If for nothing else, I loved the pace. The film spends just enough time in the first few minutes to establish where relations are with other characters from the first Doctor Strange, but very quickly sets up how and why the multiverse is the mainline throughout the film. Without giving anything away, the reason the multiverse becomes the main plot is due to the character of Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen). Her presence here was electric and I couldn't get enough of it, but I can't go into any details without ruining her story here.With the introduction of a new character in America Chavez (Xochitl Gomez) very early on in the film, it becomes clear that she will be a staple in future films for sure. I'm okay with that because her performance here, along with her arc throughout the film, was all engaging to me. Her abilities and how she has them needs to be explored a little further in the future, but she was a very interesting character. Her interactions with Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) throughout the film were great as well. They share some great chemistry together. With all of that said, let's dive into a couple of minor issues I think some fans may have.There has been a lot of hype surrounding big cameos and appearances from familiar faces, and while there is definitely a small chunk of the film dedicated to just that, I can see why people are saying this film was overhyped. Personally, I didn't know too much going into it, so I was very surprised by a couple of appearances. Still, where I feel people will be disappointed is in the fact that the multiverse itself remains focused solely on Wanda and Strange throughout the entire film. A lot more could've been explored, but I found that holding back made for a better overall film. There are some fun cameos for sure, but I think they went as far as they needed to. This film benefitted from not being bogged down by needless multiverse stuff. Plus, I believe this is still just the beginning of what kind of wacky adventures are coming in the next few films.Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness didn't blow my mind in ways I was thinking it would, but it was also much more of a focussed story and used the fun cameos for a purpose in a way I wasn't expecting either. This film was great in my opinion. Yes, you do need to see a few other Marvel Cinematic Universe entries to fully enjoy everything on display here, but it's worth it. I just had a blast with it from start to finish. Sam Raimi, who directed this film, has his vision on full display here and being a fan of his work for many years, that put a smile on my face. There are a few thrilling scenes that border on a bit of horror and that was also nice to see. Although other films/series have delved into the multiverse already, this film felt like a breath of fresh air for the franchise. It's not perfect and I have some nitpicks with certain things, but I loved watching it.",44,46,kjproulx,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur23240045/?ref_=tturv_usr_144_t,6-May-22,9,/10,
https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8122416/?ref_=tturv_perm_145,When Are They Going to Get to the Fireworks Factory?,"I will try to review this movie for what it is as opposed to comparing it to what I wanted it to be. At this point in the MCU, expectations are high for each new movie. And with the return of OG Spider-Man 2 director returning to helm this, expectations from fans were understandably high.This film had a lot on its plate. It had to be a follow-up to ""WandaVision"", follow up to ""Spider-Man No Way Home"" and a sequel to ""Dr. Strange"". Not to mention, the film has to face fan demand for bringing together this ""multiverse""Not since ""Thor: Ragnarök"" has a director in the MCU so effectively put their fingerprints on the DNA of their film. This movie is 100% Sam Raimi's movie. I am a huge fan of Raimi, and this film is full of classic ""Evil Dead"" style. The MCU is at its best when they allow the director to their job and let their vision shine.I love the action sequences in this movie. They are visceral, brutal and exciting. Danny Elfman's music helps hype up everything to the next level. Every set piece feels like it is the caliber of the top tier superhero finale. But that is a two-edged sword. When all the action scenes feel like a finale, when we get to the actual finale, it comes across as lackluster. As such the ending falls flat.Sadly the emotional core of this movie does not resonate with me. I do not sympathize with the main person our heroes are trying to protect. It is amazing how little I learn about them throughout the film, but how everything I do learn about them does nothing to endear me to them.I love the villain of this story. But when you take a look at their plan, it clearly is not fully thought through. The way things conclude can't help but draw comparison to a superior multiverse film ""Spiderverse"". And there are some points of exposition that don't make any sense when you think about it.The film isn't awful by any means. Part of the MCU's secret to success is their track record of very solid movies, and this one holds true to that. Just at this point in the MCU, and with this combination of elements, I should be loving this film. But I do inevitably walk away disappointed.

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8176958/?ref_=tturv_perm_146,A wast of time with few good moments.,"Marvel's recipe has run out. A good character like Dr. Strange faces his worst enemy: a bland story full of rehashes and with just a hint of originality. In short: a powerful sorcerer must face a witch traumatized by the loss of children she never had, while out of nowhere appears a girl who travels from universe to universe whose importance to the story is zero. Here the great protagonist is the trauma of wanting to be a mother and not being able to experience it in the reality that corresponds to us. Then a lot of things happen that involve death, destruction, the disappearance of universes, the appearance of fantastic creatures and all of that could have been resolved by going to the psychiatrist. On the other hand we have a tribute to Star Wars since a black traitor appears who in turn is supported by robots that look like C-3PO; Billy Dee Williams should be happy. The mental smallness of the characters is inconceivable: Dr. Strange cannot overcome his bad luck in love, the villain of the story should be in an insane asylum and her delusions do not support the movie and the young Latina is as transcendent as a zero . With few visual moments that catch the viewer (and a nice cameo by Bruce Campbell) Sam Raimi's work is just that of a craftsman who does his job but can't achieve anything wonderful with the lousy story of the film.

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8127409/?ref_=tturv_perm_149,A Puzzle No One Cares To Solve,"Oh director Sam Raimi is up to his ""Army Of Darkness"" ways. What with the cameos from Bruce Campbell, a spell book, slapstick snap zooms at canted angles and the Pontiac Delta 88 hovering in a muddled universe. This is a very sloppy slapping together of an intricate storyline of wish fulfillment...if only the bad gal wasn't so into being...a mother? Yeah, that is at the core of the conflict. Wanda the Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) wants the life of domestication versus being shunned as a witch in her own world. Therefore, she must harness the power of a teenager who has this gift.Okay.Unfortunately, what she also has IS the power to live the other woman's life (it's really her, if you think about it) in small doses. And only if she uses some spell book. Who knows. The entire thing is this dense. Meanwhile, Doc Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) is lamenting about his own life. Losing Christine (Rachel McAdams) to a different suitor because it would be safer for her. Such is the life of comic book heroes. A tired trope actually. So he is saddled with that question...in any other universe, would he end up with the love of his life. I shrug here, because all of this is really inconsequential since it never is addressed in the movie anyway. And they have the chemistry of a brother and sister. So I don't get her appeal.Yeah, I think this is an above average flick. Only because I do miss the old Raimi style. This brought back those memories. Other than that, I found myself dozing at parts. The special effects, while really well done, are oftentimes nauseating. Anyone with vertigo should be warned. And, well, it seemed very empty when all was said and done.To me, the multiverse is a fascinating question. One that was wonderfully realized in ""Everything, Everywhere And All At Once"" Here it seems to be a non-issue. And it aggravated me that in every universe they visit, it seems this crew don't address the chaos and mayhem they inflict on the people of the city. I mean, some of the damage to property should closed the city down. In this film, you see teen America Chavez (Xochitl Gomez) eat a torta a scene later. Ugh.The biggest nagging thought is how unnecessary this installment was. Why? Why was this made? Made no sense in the grander future schemes. Perhaps Marvel nerds can answer this.It is also much more adult. Which was a pleasant surprise. I can tell that the kids who went to see this got very lost. Their silence said it all.

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8551178/?ref_=tturv_perm_150,A Filler Episode,"This film is easily the creepiest and darkest film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Filled with jump-scares expected in the ""horror"" genre, there are also gory and genuinely unsettling moments. Sam Raimi's directing style shines through, with this film looking and feeling different than anything else under the Marvel banner. Coming in at 126 minutes (one of the shortest of the franchise), the film is fast paced and continuously moving. The acting performances are excellent, with Elizabeth Olsen's Scarlet Witch stealing the show. Though the dialogue has weak moments, the actors overcome these campy quips with undisturbed dedication.There are a lot of moving pieces in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. With the concept of the ""multiverse"" at the forefront, it is easy to get disconnected from the characters. The stakes are so high and the heroes so powerful that the early days of the MCU seem like a long-lost memory. The treatment of some of the characters is inconsistent with previous movies and the introduction of additional characters feels more like fan-service than legitimate progression. Unfortunately, I left the film lacking closure and feeling tired.As a fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, this film will carry me over until Thor: Love and Thunder hits theaters in July. While it is not a top-tier superhero film, it is satisfying to dive back into the narrative of Earth's Mightiest Heroes.

How can we trust and believe that any events matter if a future film can simply find a magic device to undo them? Tension is dissipated, emotional impact dulled. Mix that with the MCU's approach to the multiverse and this film is seriously hobbled before it starts; nothing really matters. And whilst it looks spectacular - and there are some impressive moments of genuine visual invention - it lacks physical weight; none of this hits the viewer between the eyes the way, say, Inception's startling and very physical visuals do. The second half is better than the first, not least because that's where Raimi seems more free to be Raimi - horror-tinged, and at times downright weird. Unfortunately a decent cast is undermined by Cumberbatch seeming so detached he may as well be sending in his performance via a voice only Zoom meeting. Thankfully it's not as bloated a running time as other recent entities; and whilst there is stuff to enjoy here, the overriding feeling is that either the MCU needs to be radically refreshed or else it's outstaying its welcome.",1,3,david-meldrum,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur32106619/?ref_=tturv_usr_152_t,9-Feb-23,6,/10,

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8116788/?ref_=tturv_perm_155,Continues the titular hero's story with stunning visuals and solid emotional payoffs,"""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness"" is the sequel to 2016's ""Doctor Strange"" and the 28th film to be set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Starring Benedict Cumberbatch in the lead role and directed by Sam Raimi (The ""Evil Dead"" trilogy, Sony Pictures's ""Spider-Man"" trilogy, ""Drag Me To Hell""), it continues the titular hero's story with stunning visuals and solid emotional payoffs.A short time after the events of ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"", Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) saves New York City from an invisible octopus creature while rescuing a mysterious young girl amidst the chaos. The girl later introduces herself as America Chavez (Xochitl Gomez), revealing to him that she has the ability to travel across the multiverse, which in turn has attracted many dangerous creatures after her powers. After hearing her explanation, Strange learns that his alternate self from America's universe was under mind control via witchcraft and decides to meet up with Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) to see if she knows anything about these current events.Since his big screen debut back in 2016, Doctor Strange has established himself as one of the most important heroes in the entire MCU. From making a giant inter-dimensional entity rage quit his evil plans to holding his own against the mad Titan Thanos in a battle for the Infinity Stones, Strange is not only a valuable asset to the Avengers, but also an incredibly powerful hero in his own right. Six years after his first film, Strange finally has another solo role outside of appearing in other hero's films with ""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness"" showing us the dire consequences of tampering with unknown forces.In contrast to previous films and TV series showing the fun aspects of accessing the multiverse, this one treats the very idea of its unfamiliarity as a deadly serious issue. Strange, who experienced first hand what happens when things go horribly wrong back in ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"", is presented in an incredibly vulnerable state. Gone is the cocky sorcerer supreme he started out as and what we have in his place is someone who hasn't yet realised the severity of toying with something so frightening. This adds some much needed depth to Strange as a character, similar to how it took the loss of half the universe's population for Tony Stark to realise importance of having a true family. Stark and Strange have always been kindred spirits with arrogant personalities who need a reality check in order to humble themselves, and this film shows how the latter is now coming to terms with this sudden urge to keep his ego in check.Returning to the director's chair after nine years, Sam Raimi injects his signature style into every scene while also delivering a Marvel film like no other so far. Of course, Raimi is no stranger to the superhero genre since many are familiar with his work on the Sony ""Spider-Man"" films but he is also known for writing and directing horror films like the ""Evil Dead"" trilogy and ""Drag Me to Hell"". It seems like some of Raimi's personal affinity for the genre has rubbed off into this one since he can't help but push the boundaries of what the audience could consider nightmare fuel. I loved how he made the hostile inhabitants of various multiverses seem so terrifying, even relying on the odd jump scare to keep viewers on their toes. Another thing Raimi is known for is his off-the-wall comic relief intended to calm the audiences' nerves after viewing something scary. There were plenty of moments that should provide the occasional chuckle to relieve the tension in a scene, some of which may even surprise veteran MCU fans. I can't discuss too much else about Raimi's best directorial moments since they will venture into major spoiler territory so all I will say is that if you are familiar with his films, keep a close eye out for some of those hidden Easter eggs.Visually, this is the most vibrant looking Marvel film to date. Raimi goes all out to emphasise how much better or worse these multiverses look in comparison to our own. Certain places may give off the appearance of somewhere futuristic and high tech while others look like a post-apocalyptic wasteland. No matter which of the two, I really enjoyed how different they each seemed whenever Strange happened to stumble into one or the other. Despite all of these intertwining universes, the film is still pretty easy to follow. In most other media that deal with inter-dimensional travel and exploration, you expect things to be confusing due to the multitude of things happening all at once. However, for the most part, the film has adopted a more straightforward method of telling the story. I'm not sure if this was Raimi's decision or if Kevin Feige and the other higher ups at Disney wanted things this way, but I think this was the right thing to do overall.Something else that took me by surprise was the quality of the film's score. In recent decades, there haven't been that many memorable musical motifs in superhero films. Aside from perhaps some of the Batman movies, the MCU happens to be the worst offender in this category. ""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness"" appears to remedy this by recruiting Danny Elfman to bring us what could be considered the best musical score in a Marvel film since the four ""Avengers"" movies. Not only does Elfman implement some of the original ""Doctor Strange"" theme into his score but also certain tunes from other media I won't mention here at the risk of giving away spoilers. Elfman is a frequent collaborator with Sam Raimi so their combined efforts helped elevate this film above what could have been another one with a forgettable score. In addition to keeping an eye out for visual Easter eggs, I also think fans should keep an ear out as well.As mentioned earlier, the Doctor Strange we have been familiar with over the past six years is noticeably different in this film and Benedict Cumberbatch plays into that perfectly. I liked seeing this more pragmatic Strange making decisions based on what is necessary rather than out of recklessness, especially after we are shown the dangerous ramifications of upsetting the balance of the multiverse. Likewise, it's also nice to see Elizabeth Olsen finally having the opportunity to play Wanda Maximoff closer to her Scarlet Witch persona. I'd been wondering when we'd actually see this particular incarnation on the big screen and it sure was satisfying to see her done justice. Also, newcomer Xochitl Gomez does a fine job holding her own alongside the rest of the cast. It's always entertaining to see young characters who wield incredible powers finding out how to keep them under control and it's equally as interesting to see how she learns how to use them in combat.I feel I should now address the elephant in the room, in that there has been speculation over the implementation of some newly acquired IPs thanks to Disney's buyout of certain companies. Before its release, there were many rumours circulating that this film contains some exciting alleged cameos. Without spoiling any of these possible appearances, all I will say is keep your expectations to a reasonable level because not all of them turned out to be true. This film is by no means on the same plain as ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" in terms of fanservice but it does have a few great surprises that seem to show the direction the MCU is heading.In its current state, the MCU looks set to deliver some new and exciting content in the near future. From what I can gather, Phase 4 has undoubtedly been its most experimental so far. We've seen Disney+ series expand upon some already established hero backstories and some movies that have even deviated from the typical origin story template as a whole. ""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness"" is yet another crucial puzzle piece in a bigger picture that has long been laid out for us. Regardless of how it all turns out in the end, the MCU isn't going anywhere anytime soon.I rate it 8/10.",33,35,MrDHWong,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur18374284/?ref_=tturv_usr_155_t,5-May-22,8,/10,
https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8116942/?ref_=tturv_perm_156,Sam Raimi returns in his own unique way as the director of a superhero movie.,"Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is the sequel to the first Doctor Strange movie from 2016. This sequel is directed by Sam Raimi, the director of Spider-Man and The Evil Dead. In the film, Doctor Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) and Wong (Benedict Wong) must protect the girl America Chavez (Xochitl Gomez) from demonic forces, who try to make America her own to travel between universes. To better protect America, Doctor Strange asks Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) for help, but America's uncontrollable powers end up traveling across universes. Here, in these unknown worlds, they must continue to protect America from the evil that travels after them.With this film, Sam Raimi returns after 9 years as a director and after 15 years also as a director of a superhero film. He manages to return as a director in his own unique way. He knows how to bring this film back into focus and sometimes in similar ways to capture scenes as he has done in previous films. Fans can enjoy and recognize some more of these references and hints to his old movies. Surprisingly, Sam Raimi also provides an introduction to the horror genre in the Marvel film series. This film uses elements that can be more exciting or even scary for young children. While horror elements aren't too scary, kids under 12 shouldn't watch this movie alone without a parent with them. In addition to the horror elements, the film also uses sequences with prolonged flashing lighting effects, which may be sensitive to people with photosensitive epilepsy. Sam Raimi, together with the photography director and editors, also ensure that the visual effects come across well and believable. In this way they know how to convey the transition between different universes in a beautiful way. Sometimes you can see with some creatures that they have been placed in the film with CGI, but fortunately this does not disturb while watching. To better understand the story, it is useful if you have seen previous Marvel films and series, especially their Disney+ series WandaVision. Fortunately, the film itself explains other references to previous films or series enough so that you can continue to follow what is happening or what it is about. Furthermore, the film has a gripping story that you as a viewer quickly get involved in. The film script was written solely by Michel Waldron, for whom this is only his first film script. Before this, he has written more scripts for TV series, even for the Marvel Disney+ series Loki. Still, the script is sometimes a bit on the weak side and problems are solved too quickly or too simply. A director like Sam Raimi deserved to work with a better screenwriter. Sam Raimi and Marvel producer Kevin Feige could have looked at this a little better, because then they could have had a better movie. Around the film, just like the previous Marvel film Spider-Man: No Way Home, there were many ideas and theories about what could emerge in this film. For a more entertaining experience, you should not go to this film with too high expectations, because that can lead to disappointment in some cases. In this film Sam Raimi also works together with music composer Danny Elfman, who again manages to provide a good and appropriate soundtrack. The acting is also well done by the film cast. After the events of the preceding Marvel films, Benedict Cumberbatch still manages to portray the character of Doctor Strange in an appropriate and somewhat sarcastic way. Yet in this film he is also a bit more inquisitive and insecure with the new universes that he also visits for the first time. Elizabeth Olsen also gets the chance to portray her character on a more dramatic side in this film after everything her character has been through in the previous films. The rest of the cast doesn't get many opportunities to do much with their characters because of the lesser script. The celebrities are doing just as good a job as in their previous Marvel films and the film also has a few entertaining cameos.",11,16,movieman6-413-929510,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur34790048/?ref_=tturv_usr_156_t,5-May-22,7,/10,
https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8713586/?ref_=tturv_perm_157,"This should have been the movie that finally would come up with a cohesive idea behind the multiverse that Marvel cooked for so long. Instead, we have two hours of nothing.","With ""Multiverse of Madness"" I have the official confirmation that Marvel does not know what is doing with this fourth MCU phase. After all these movies and TV shows focused on this concept, this should have been the film that would finally express a cohesive vision behind it. I mean, the title speaks by itself. Instead, we have some kind of auto celebrative production that throws around characters from unrelated narratives such as Charles Xavier or Reed Richards, that do not add any depth to the story. Seems that Marvel just fished randomly in the huge vastness of their superheroes roster, and inserted them in the script, just because they can. Obviously, there was no proper thinking while the creators were writing. The whole setup is just unbelievably bad. I don't know who this America Chavez is, and the plot does not give any background about her, except for a very short and ineffective flashback that comes way too late in the movie. Therefore, I never perceived any danger for her, never rooted for or against her. She seemed more like a side character, with the purpose to fill a bit a few minutes of plot, except she is in fact the protagonist and the whole movie turns around her salvation from the bad guy. Not to mention that the acting skills of Xochitl Gomez are average to say the least. There was no proper build up, we discover who the villain is in the first 20 minutes and the reveal is pretty lazy and uninspired.Of course with a director as talented as Sam Raimi, there were pretty creative scenes, especially when it comes to more horror vibe scenes. I liked the photography, there were some peculiar shots that I have really enjoyed. On the other hand, the CGI quality is very inconsistent: there are a few stunning effects that I am pretty sure would truly surprise me on a big cinema screen with a proper audio system, unfortunately there are also many sequences that are way below the standards for a multi million production. I think that the first three phases were excellent, there was a clear direction and the audience could understand where the MCU was going. Since the beginning of the most recent narrative strand, I started to lose interest, but I always gave Marvel the benefit of the doubt, until now. With that being said, I will keep watching once in a while their products, but not with the same intensity as before.",3,2,fciocca,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur62460576/?ref_=tturv_usr_157_t,3-Dec-22,5,/10,
https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8115054/?ref_=tturv_perm_158,worst of the worst,"The good is the cinematography and visuals which are, mostly, great. I actually saw the movie in 3D and that was trippy and worth it! I highly recommend seeing this movie in 3D. Everyone did a great acting job, except for Elizabeth Olsen of course - probably the worst casting choice in Marvel history. The very high, and weird, pace of the movie trickles out into a few pretty cool and good and horror-esque moments in the 3rd act with a couple of moments that are pretty gorey for a Disney superhero movie. We also get a few cool pretty nice fights, but sadly here the praise ends.Where this movie fails is in the story. It is very, very, very thin. Perhaps some of the plot holes I saw actually wasn't plot holes, everything move so fast, but there are definitely a bunch of them.They take the already thin story from Spiderman: No way home, and the nonsense story from Wandavision and mix it together in a psychedelic weirdness soup which never really amounts to anything. This mindtrip and very high pace of the movie is meant to cover this up, to make you not notice how badly told and how badly written this movie actually is.Xochitl Gomez who does a great acting job, she is wonderful actually, but her character America Chavez is just thrown in there and with very little background story she becomes the McGuffin of the story. America is a very liberal very PC and very ""diverse"" character in the comics, so although I see people complain I did not mind that at all. She stays true to who she is in the comics, and I have no problem with that, it is the character here in this movie and how badly written she is that bothers me.The jokes never land. I think I chuckled a bit once, the other attempts at ""marvel humor"" did not work, especially not in this type of movie.I give the movie a couple of extra points for a marvellous post credit scene, and a few decently surprising cameo's. But in the end this is not that great of a movie, and we are also left with a few lingering questions. I think this is mid- to low Marvel. I give it a 5/10 but I will throw in 1 extra point for never having to see a certain character ever again, so 6/10.If you follow Marvel and you like superhero movies, this is of course worth it. I was not unhappy, and I think my money was well spent, but this is not anything special. The first Dr Strange was a lot better.---
review updateI just saw the movie again and I have to say it is even worse than I first thought. On second viewing the plot holes shine more, and you can clearly see that many more of the actors cannot do their jobs. The high speed of the movie, pacing completely off, make you not notice all the errors the first time around but seeing it again with this level of acting... oh my... a real travesty. And the illuminati scene with the poor casting choices and their horrible ""jokes"" was so cringe I could barely watch.On my second viewing Elizabeth Olsen also get even worse... I did not think that would be possible, but here she really show us she is the worst actress in the entire MCU. And yes, that includes extras.I need to lower my score significantly. This is top 5 worst Marvel movies for sure. It is not as boring as Black Panther or as horrible as Endgame was, but this is really, really bad. I will lower the score to 3/10.",148,194,namob-43673,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur60195330/?ref_=tturv_usr_158_t,4-May-22,1,/10,

But...,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free thoughts, please follow my blog to read my full review :)""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is undoubtedly one of the most unique installments in the MCU, thanks to Sam Raimi's distinctive visual style and his impressive ability to elude the Marvel formula by seriously venturing into the horror elements. Never has a film from the cinematic universe been so violent, bloody, and terrifying.Benedict Cumberbatch and especially Elizabeth Olsen carry the complex story about the multiverse through Michael Waldron's flawed screenplay. The balance between the various storylines could be better, America Chavez is just one MacGuffin to reach another MacGuffin, and the journey through the multiple universes only compensates for the mind-blowing visual effects.Some personal disappointment is associated with the cameos treatment and the lack of real-location filming. Overall, more was expected from what was supposed to be Phase Four's ""big movie"", but it's a solid entry into the top half of the franchise.""Rating: B.",6,10,msbreviews,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur79118814/?ref_=tturv_usr_160_t,6-May-22,7,/10,

It felt refreshing to see a spin on the classic Marvel formula. Olsen delivers one of the best performances in the MCU and Doctor Strange gets a lot more character time than I expected. The story can feel a bit hacked together, which is expected given the tumultuous behind the scenes events, but it delivers all the expected emotion. Raimi proves yet again he can be wildly creative with horror as there are several scenes that really impressed me.However, there were a lot of cameos teased for this film and I don't feel like they fully delivered. Given this is now the third MCU project in the past year to heavily feature the multiverse, I expected more to be happening with it by this point. They just keep teasing it and teasing it.While I do find this film to be slightly disappointing given the lack of true madness in the multiverse, it overall is a pretty enjoyable time at the movies.",5,7,cardsrock,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur24373984/?ref_=tturv_usr_161_t,11-May-22,8,/10,

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8121335/?ref_=tturv_perm_165,A Fantastic Unique Comic Book Film,"After a long wait, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness has finally come to cinemas and today and I have watched it and here is my review for what was my most anticipated film of 2022. The premise of the film sees after the events of Spider-Man: No Way Home. Stephen Strange has to deal with more misgivings with the Multiverse that could lead to major ramifications.Main Character
Benedict Cumberbatch is once again back as Dr Stephen Strange and he is fantastic in the role. The film does a really good job of expanding his character, as in the recent team up films we haven't had a huge chance to do that. This film continues his character journey from the original film and Cumberbatch absolutely nails it.Supporting Characters
After WandaVision I truly realised just how great Elisabeth Olsen is as Wanda Maximoff and she shines here. Her character is given real shine here and her development is probably my favourite part of the film and I am glad it is given the time and justice for the character and actress. Benedict Wong gets more screen time as Wong and he is actually one of the most underrated characters in the MCU and I love the dynamic between him and Cumberbatch as they have developed into one of my favourite partnerships and this is the most we have seen of it. Xochitl Gomez plays America Chavez and she is a fun character, I don't really know anything about her character in the comics but she was a well fleshed out character here. Again the dynamic between her and Strange is well realised and feels like a friendship that we can care about. Rachel McAdams is back as Christine Palmer and she is better realised here then she was in the previous film and I liked how her character was used throughout the film.Story
The story is good, this film does plenty of good character work and the main characters progress nicely and it really helps with the plot. You understand where they are all coming from and how things progress feels fluid. But, this film doesn't hit all the points, there are things from the previous film that are seemingly ignored and I understand it couldn't quite fit here but I was disappointed that it was clearly ignored. Also one character's ending didn't quite work for me and I think it could have been handled a bit better.Script
The script is really good, the mix of humour and drama is really well realised. This film actually feels quite unique considering it is in the MCU but the writing is still really clever and it just suits this film.Style
The film looks amazing, he film doesn't jump all over the place with its aspect ratio this time which is great. The CGI looks amazing and the tone is so interesting. This is the closest the MCU will ever get to a horror film and these elements feel really unique to a Marvel film and that made it really stand out to me. It is actually paced really well, which I was a little worried about and despite a lot going on it manages to all link up well.Overall
Overall, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is a fantastic film, you have to have watched the first Doctor Strange and WandaVision to truly appreciate it but this unique and entertaining film is definitely worth the watch.Rating - 9/10.",9,17,alindsayal,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur147091341/?ref_=tturv_usr_165_t,6-May-22,9,/10,

Although the film felt like the experiment had gone too far.Everything was out of place, and because the film moved at such a slow pace, it seemed to last forever. The acting and line delivery were bizarre, the action was shot in the most boring way possible (except for one scene), and the editing was occasionally confusing due to time freezing between scenes.Overall, while I laughed a lot because some scenes were so bizarre (allegedly intentional or self-ironic), I'd still watch a more traditional comic book film rather than this one.5 stars out of 10.

They attempted to bring together so many varied threads - WandaVision and What If... and subplots from the original Dr Strange that happened 6 years ago, not to mention references to other MCU properties. Following everything practically requires a glossary. In order to make that work, it feels like half this movie is exposition and the other half is forced action/dialogue with pretty low stakes.

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8117112/?ref_=tturv_perm_173,Some Bald Guy Once Said: Keep Your Expectations Low and You Will Never Be Disappointed,"So thanks to watching some early reviews on YouTube saying this is more of a Doctor Strange and Wanda movie than a Multiverse movie, I adjusted my expectations and I enjoyed the movie thoroughly.And you might say, ""well it's literally called Multiverse of Madness, how do you expect me not to expect a Multiverse from this movie"", which I agree with. I had the same expectation when I first heard about the name of the movie and saw the trailers. But trust me, the whole thing revolves around the Multiverse And there is a lot of Madness, but not in a way you're thinking of. Naming this movie Multiverse of Madness was a real double-edged sword and it really shows, by how people reacted to it.First of all, I gotta say that this is probably the most different and unique movie of MCU, at least in the aesthetic department, or should I say the most different-looking. And you already know it's exactly because of Sam Raimi and the horror and creepy aspect he introduces in this movie. And I loved it!About the runtime, I remember seeing people argue that 2 hours is not actually bad and Sam Raimi movies are always more or less 2 hours and we are the unreasonable ones to think 2 hours. And I and many others thought ""well how is a movie about the multiverse is gonna be only 2 hours? We need at least 3 hours"". Which weren't wrong, because after watching the movie I can say that it definitely needed at least 20 more minutes. The pacing is really on and off, it kinda lingers in some scenes and it fast-forwards in some scenes that needed more time, especially the ending. I think they just need to hire better writers because once again, this didn't ""feel"" a movie, it felt like an episode and a teaser to the real thing, but I still really enjoyed it and had fun with it.And it is really weird too because the last movie they released was literally 2:28 hours and they've already seen that the longer runtime still sells like Infinity War and the 3-hour Endgame which are like in the top 5 of all time sellers in BoxOffice. I don't know why they cut scenes or why they didn't let some scenes linger more. Was it because of the writing? Then why not hire better writers or a team of writers like Markus and McFeely who knew what they were doing and gave us 4 decently written movies? I hope now that they're delving into the multiverse stuff, they actually get more creative writers and work on the script a lot more before releasing the movie.It would be interesting to see a director's cut of the movie or even a Scott Derrickson version where he actually continued the first movie and not mainly WandaVision (which is an understandable problem people have with this), but we'll never see just like we'll never see Edgar Wright's Ant-Man. If I were in Feige's, I'd just go crazy with every movie and give 100% freedom to directors to make whatever tf they want and go nuts with it and have a different MCU next to the main one. And even now is the best time to do it, why not let Edgar Wright make an Ant-Man movie and call it something like What If Ant-Man...? This is the perfect opportunity for them to go crazy with the multiverse stuff, but I guess making movies is hard and expensive, but I doubt these movies won't sell. Just give directors full control and hire better writers and writing teams and the word of mouth and the good reviews do the rest, just like Everything Everywhere All at Once.For people that are concerned about cameos and think this is gonna be a cameo galore and fanservice, don't worry. The cameos are fairly short, they are great and serve the plot, and are not just there just to be there, and they have some of the most brutal scenes I've seen from MCU. There was one particular scene that you know when you see it, that trod the line between PG-13 and R, and was so brutal that if you showed me the clip of it without context and without telling me anything, I would assume it was a scene from The Boys season 3. Yeah, that level of brutality!Danny Elfman did the score and it fit the movie and the gothic vibe beautifully and there was a certain battle that I'm not gonna even hint at, but you'll know when you watch the movie, that was just audio-visual delight. I am a little disappointed and sad that they didn't use the amazing Doctor Strange theme Michael Giacchino did, and I think he would've done an amazing job if they kept him, but I guess Danny is Sam's blue-eyed boy. But the score is still good, just wish his iconic theme was used more in this movie.The visuals were amazing too, although it still had some that looked really bad, and it seems like Marvel has been lacking with CGI in this phase more than before, even in the tv shows.But the thing about the visuals is that even though they are great and a joy to witness, I kinda miss the reality-bending we got in the first movie and No Way Home, I wish they used it here too and went crazier with it.And as for the direction, I gotta say it's pretty good and it's obvious Sam Raimi directed it as it has his fingerprint all over this movie and I loved it. It seems like Marvel is getting a little more open to having visionary directors take the helm and give them freedom. It's obvious that this movie is not given to Sam with 100 percent freedom, but I think they're getting a little bit better and I hope this freedom becomes bigger in the next projects. Sam Raimi does a great job with all the creepy, horror scenes, and the jump scares and this movie is more about witchcraft than it is about wizardry and spells. I really hope they keep doing these different genres and don't just stick to action-comedy as they've been for a long time. It's a breath of a fresh air seeing this being a different kind of superhero movie.I also really liked that he actually used a good color grading and that the colors and environments are alive and that they don't look like another bland Marvel movie.I don't think I need to talk about the acting because you already know they all do an amazing job. But surprisingly Wanda is the star of this movie and some people have a problem with that? I get that it's called Doctor Strange and this movie kinda lets Wanda outshine him, but did you also have a problem with Infinity War being more of a Thanos movie, or The Dark Knight is more of a Joker movie? I don't get that people say Doctor Strange had less things to do or even less cool things to do than Infinity War, because it felt to me that they both had more of or the same amount of screen-time and Doctor Strange had obviously more screen time.And America Chavez is a really interesting and a great addition to the MCU and Xochitl Gomez did a good job of portraying her.Some reviews said that Christine Palmer was again underutilized, which I guess? But I don't know what more they could've done with the fast pacing of this movie and I thought they did a decent job with Palmer anyway. Obviously, and as I said before, this movie could've benefited from some breathers and 20 extra minutes, but it was still fine.We also get Ashley Williams of course! And Bruce Campbell is great as ever. You can't have a Sam Raimi movie without Ash!I also heard some people say that they liked the first one better, which it's ok I guess? You could argue that the pacing of the first movie was better and Stephen Strange had a good development in there, but since the villain sucked in that movie, I cannot say that the first one is better. The villain and ""their"" motivation in this movie were far better in this movie, and I guess they had some movies and shows to get more development and it's kinda unfair to compare and say this one had more development because duh. But even if this was their first appearance, they still had a better motivation and were a better character anyway. (I'm using ""they"" to not spoil who the villain is but I think it's obvious for anyone who that is)In conclusion, this movie might not be what you think is going to be, so manage your expectations. The acting is great, the direction and Sam Raimi's touch are great and so is the cinematography, the music is good but disappointingly there is little to no use of Doctor Strange's iconic theme, the villain is good, the visuals are great but it needed more visuals and reality-bending from the first one, the horror aspect is fine and gives a fresh look to the MCU, but it's ultimately rushed, the pacing needed some work and needed extra time. I also forgot to say that there are some loose ends left from the first movie that they didn't deal with for some reason and it's not really a continuation of Doctor Strange as it is more a continuation of WandaVision, and in that case, people are kinda right if they think this wasn't that much of a Doctor Strange movie and more Wanda's.Maybe I'm just a little carried away and I'm giving it an 8 impulsively, and I am doing it as I've done times before, and watching it a second time will show me its flaws better, and yeah it's not a full 8/10 but more like a 7.5 leaning towards 8 and I liked this one more than the first one.Update: Watched it a second time and I think I like it a little less and noticed more problems with it, but I still like it, so I'm changing it to a 7 here.",341,205,MamadNobari97,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur45507551/?ref_=tturv_usr_173_t,5-May-22,6,/10,
https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8118485/?ref_=tturv_perm_174,Great but I'm not impressed,"I like that marvel took a darker route to doctor strange, guess it was to be expected once they got a horror movie director to it. It still has a few laughs and visually speaking was fantastic. But as much as I loved it, I was a little underwhelmed.When ""everything everywhere all at once"" came out I thought wow,so glad this came out before multiverse of madness because people are probably going to compare and this should be enjoyed on its own; but now I can't help compare Dr strange to that movie. Hypocritical. I think I was more engaged in that one, and since I watched it recently, Dr Strange's multiverse didn't feel as novel. It felt like ""everything everywhere all at once"" but in the MCU and darker. The pacing also felt off at times, it could have been made more thrilling, and despite this being one of the more ambitious projects done by Marvel, I feel like more could have been done.I'm also kinda disappointed by Wanda and Dr Strange because they both weren't as mighty as I thought they'd be when they fought head on. They've both shown much more power in other marvel projects. I mean, Wanda literally made Thanos ""rain fire"" in endgame despite it killing his army, and Dr strange closed up the multiverse while it was ripping apart in Spider-Man, just to mention a few. Also surprised there's no mention of Loki or the sacred timeline,time keepers. I hope they have good plans for Kang the conqueror.I still loved this and it is great, I particularly loved the more grim aspects of it like Dr Strange's counterparts in alternate universes. Loved the hero characters that made cameos in other universes. I just think it could have been more thrilling, the movie reels us in through showing us the actual madness of the multiuniverse with prismatic visuals, but the story or plot line itself isn't much to be astounded by. They focused more on creating this amazing multiverse but they didn't really deliver a good enough story to match it. Don't be dissuaded though, it is still very much worth the watch.And I can't wait to see Charlize Theron in the next one, Marvel really has a way of getting you excited for sequels, mastered that.",10,10,AfricanBro,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur120413622/?ref_=tturv_usr_174_t,5-May-22,7,/10,

Instead many of them appeared for a couple of minutes, fought and died. Perfect examples are the Illuminati and the Shangri-La School of Witchcraft and Wizardry where students die in handfuls without anyone wondering why they have to die so stupidly. Another question I asked myself is how Scarlet witch knew about America's existence at the beginning of the movie and how she could find it since America ends up in our universe by chance running away from a demon supposedly sent by Scarlet herself.The answer could be the cursed book but this still does not explain why there is a temple with the statue of Scarlet witch on the top of the Himalayas and what those 4 monsters on steroids were doing there.

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8147938/?ref_=tturv_perm_185,I Went in With Low Expectations and Walked Away Very Impressed,"Every sequel has the burden of surpassing expectations or avoiding the impulse to retread the same ground. This is doubly true for the MCU.... maybe even several times over with how many movies and shows the cash cow turns out. Doctor Strange is far from the weakest entry but it's not as distinctive when compared to the rest of the expansive Marvel library. The Multiverse of Madness brings back many of the original's same characters and boasts similar action set pieces, but I was pleased by how much I could see Raimi's fingerprints on the stylistic choices. I know some critics complained about how this movie didn't push the envelope further but I thought they struck a nice balance of taking a relaxing dip as opposed to cannonballing into the pool. Between some of the more offbeat humour, the camera angles to the more horror-style pacing and action, the creative team walked a fine line. But I think they included enough to court those looking for something more akin to Raimi's zany previous works. I was also surprised at how violent some of the movie's scenes got. Some of it was implied but again, it had a surprising amount of bite and I dug it.Stephen has been incrementally growing as a character but the Multiverse of Madness really holds a mirror up to his arrogance and his futility as a hero and I really enjoyed that decision. The character development around the board was a standout element for this movie. Strange has always come across as a less likeable and more deadpan Tony Stark and while he was willing to help Peter Parker in No Way Home, he needed some humility and its served in sizeable doses here. I also respected the route they took with Wanda's arc. Without spoiling anything, she's still reeling from the events of Wandavision. She's in considerable pain and more than a little miffed that she lost so much while others were spared. Her focus is single-minded but it never becomes too pat or too irritating. Her actions are a reflection of her hellish situation and seem dark but plausible despite the larger picture being secondary. It's a solid job by the screenwriter (Michael Waldron) and that continues in America Chavez's arc. She isn't star-struck by Strange, which would have been too easy. The good Doctor has to earn her respect and her trust, which she has every reason to withhold. The development isn't perfectly spread out but the main players are done properly and it's easier to miss on that than you'd think.Benedict Cumberbatch is a wholly impressive actor, he rocks almost every part he's cast in. With that said however, Doctor Stephen Strange is a part that's so firmly in his wheelhouse that his casting surprised no one. I do think this might be his best performance as Stephen, he gets more emotional depth to his role and I liked that he was a more vulnerable and imperfect Doctor Strange. The true standout is Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda Maximoff, this shouldn't be surprising after her stellar turn in Wandavision or in just about anything else she's in. Her character's emotional turmoil has become bottomless in this adventure and Elizabeth's emotionality helps you understand Wanda's mindset and how it has corrupted her reasoning. Elizabeth's one of the most talented actresses out there and with her continued work, I'm always going to be interested in what she's doing next. Benedict Wong and Chiwetel Ejiofor return and I liked how they also weren't given the same ground to tread. Mordo gets a nice character flip that Ejiofor is more than game for and Wong's humour is always a welcome diversion. Xochitl Gomez doesn't have any easy task but she's up to it as America Chavez. She not only has to get us to comprehend her character's plight but help open the door to Stephen's journey in the Multiverse of Madness. I was really happy to see Rachel McAdams again but if anyone got the short shrift it's her. She wasn't well utilized in the first one, she gets different material here but I still think she could have done more. I'm not going into the surprise inclusions (or incursions) in the cast, even if they've been revealed, I don't want to spoil the fun.Multiverse doesn't feature many missteps, there are small plotholes here and there, but none of them upset me to the point where it threw me off. If there's anything that disappointed me about Multiverse, it just can't be all things to everyone. It can't be the edgy/hardcore and campy Raimi horror movie that the film buffs wanted. It can't be the revolutionary action/sci-fi superhero movie because Marvel can't clear the ever moving bar every single time (No Way Home has become the new benchmark since the Thanos/Avengers saga) and it can't escape the widening expectations of the die-hard Marvel fans. I will say this isn't the best Marvel movie and it's debatable whether it's even one of the best Marvel movies that's come out the past couple of years. But if that's the pass/fail question that you're asking yourself every time Marvel releases a movie, you might need to take a break regardless.I went into the theatre like most of the audience for this movie, hopeful but understandably skeptical. I think people are starting to bet on when Marvel's going to buckle under its own weight. I'm suffering from a little comic book fatigue but The Multiverse of Madness has enough juice to keep the ball rolling. It gave one of Marvel's most one note characters some real emotional depth, they bring enough of the visual sensibility that made the first entry memorable while adding something new and it's a unique film in the ever expanding Marvel cinematic universe which is an accomplishment by itself. I'd rate this around an 8.5/10 but I'm rounding up to 9. Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is absolutely worth seeing on the big screen and hopefully we can expect the next couple of Marvel movies to be just as invigorating.",5,5,CANpatbuck3664,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur63857399/?ref_=tturv_usr_185_t,15-May-22,9,/10,

I don't think it is bad, unwatchable, but, at this point, the overall plot is so complicated that my brain hurts.I think, today, that movies that are from the MCU main plot-thread are only for die-hard fans. Fillers are just fillers that touch the main plot-thread; but then there are movies like Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness that really tries to set the tone of the Phase we are in.With the flop that was Love and Thunder, I was concerned that this one was going to be a pain to watch. But nope, it was OK, although I could see some shining light into what Love and Thunder would turn out to be. Corky lines and all.Spider-Man: No Way Home sort of gave us a good feeling of what convoluted mess the whole Multiverse shenanigan would be; and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is exactly as the title: madness.The plot is probably the main problem here: it is too simplistic in a setting too complex. I don't think the plot is bad or anything, is just that the multiverse stuff is so complicated that you don't care about the main reason all the stuff is happening. You just want to know what is up with this whole Multiverse bonanza. And to make things worse, we are not even sure if Strange from Earth-616 is the original Strange we are used to, if there ever was one, so we don't even care if things go south because there will always be another universe to try to make up for the cr** that happened.Kudos for the darker tone and blood.

Instead, we suffer from unlikable character-itis in this latest MCU entry. Seriously - is there a single person here who is worth rooting for? Sure, Elizabeth Olsen's Scarlet Witch is unsurprisingly front and center after years of playing second fiddle to the more noteworthy Avengers, but she and Cumberbatch's Stephen Strange do not feel like natural nemeses, nor are they particularly animated in this film.And yes, there are some cool effects scattered throughout, and random cameos (Prof. X, is that you? Thanks again, multiverse). But 'Madness' drags on despite not having an overly long runtime - that's perhaps worse than having a long runtime and feeling long.I'm sure this is only a sign of things to come, but the line between ""pre-Endgame"" and ""post-Endgame"" is beginning to become pretty clear.",2,4,Mike_Devine,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur5631526/?ref_=tturv_usr_199_t,23-Oct-22,5,/10,

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8130287/?ref_=tturv_perm_204,I'm left feeling unsure,"My gut feeling about DR Strange is he's better as a cameo in other films, too much time on him I feel it ends up a bit convoluted borderline nonsensical but also easier as it's so easy to explain anything away.This was far better than the first, the action, story, acting and effects were all a big improvement. However with marvel films I feel they have this ""living up to the buzz"" that trailers and other things they do create for films. In this respect it did not, the cameos whilst cool were short lived and I did pop for a couple overall after reading and watching so much I feel this promised way more than it delivered, but I guess that's what it's for, you'll always go and see it so the money is there, until disappointment turns to non attendance then there will be these feelings.Do I like waiting for cut scenes? Not really, we're they that exciting? Well one had a new cool actress and one was literally mocking you for staying so no, got no excitement from that.But key, does this make you want more dr strange? Answer for me is yes but only in cameos or spin offs with other people, him alone is a pass for me. I don't love the character, I don't really enjoy his variance of the universe and the people in his direct company.There were the usual attempts at woke which always crop up now, par for the course but still sadly so blatant.Overall it's a rainy Sunday film not a classic marvel you will rewatch. I'd definitely not watch it again. But I have to admit the standard of marvel films from ten rings to eternals to venom, the quality seems to be dropping, they almost need a new hot star to base a franchise around.

With 26 predecessors, the second Strange film remains almost original due to its dark and suspenseful undertones. The use of ominous music, dread drenched imagery and the unfiltered & ""gruesome"" outcomes, offers a new and unique experience which is something to behold. Don't get me wrong however, as this is still an MCU film therefore, you are in store for top of the class action and for me, this is where the film shines the brightest. Here, Magic is the name of the game and the film features ONE OF THE BEST visual effects & scores I have ever seen. The battle scenes and jumps across multiverses was captivating and immersive. What comes next is unpredictable and exciting, proof of unlimited creative juices from our filmmakers. That musical battle... WOW.Another highlight of this film is how it uses the Multiverse concept. Fans are in store for an example of the crossover potential of this Multiverse, with characters from different universes, making an exhilarating appearance. We also see deeper & extensive implications of Multiverse-rending actions as new power players are introduced. Exciting stuff!What didn't work for me, was the ending and the script. It seemed that no one knew how to end the film as it became more of the same (I did say almost original, right?). The dialogue also seemed cheesy at times so much so that tremendous acting from our leads, were not able to save these scenes.Overall, Sam Raimi's first crack at an MCU film, was a resounding success. His signature brand of weird and horror brings much needed fresh ideas. There is definitely room for improvement but with truly amazing effects and immersive score, there is zero chance for viewers to get bored.PS: My wife whispered sweet lines to me mid viewing.

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8122558/?ref_=tturv_perm_212,The choice is yours,"Directed by Sam Raimi Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness has us following up with Stephen Strange(Benedict Cumberbatch). Stephen finds himself on a multiversal journey. When he comes across a young girl named America Chavez(Xochitl Gomez) being pursued by a monster. When he and Wong question her they find out that She has the power to freely travel the Multiverse. And soon other beings begin seeking America. Madness would be the best way to describe this film for both better and worst. The movie within its limits does not hold back from its visuals, action, and Gore It throws a lot at you. The Locations are interesting although there are some realities that when you see them it feels as though you wish you got to see slightly more of those locations. The story does fall apart in many areas there are plot holes where it is clear that doing the multiverse has opened up some recons. In many ways, it feels cluttered in some parts. The tone in many ways feels like a Raimi film when it's said that this is not like the rest of the MCU it's not that far off. There are some things that kids might be able to handle. While you do get the typical Jokes it is not as Forumulalic. Yes, there's a villain and yes the overall goal is to stop the villain. The Action is intense, fast, and Bloody Old PG-13 Style Bloody. The amount of Death that Follows in this Film and How Brutal some of it is Executed. Combine with horror Elements, when it is Raimi putting his vision to the screen. It's here where the film is at its best, when the movie starts to pull away that's where it loses some of its appeal. It might not feel in line with the rest of the MCU you, but it does feel more in line with Doctor Strange. Where sometimes it is bright and colorful, but also has its more grim occult Morbid. The cast themselves Benedict Cumberbatch of course is just as great as always He embodies this character While still having much of that Charm. Although he is downplayed a bit. The whole time people are just judging him saying he's an idiot and he is at fault at the time. And moments where he is just gullible. Wong is Good though he has his problems. Elizabeth Olsen quite possibly has the best performance in the film. Let's just say that they don't puss out with her. The whole plot with American Chavez would seem like if you were going to introduce this character this would probably be the best to put her. While She is not in the way and thrown in the background. Why? Really out of all the characters could introduce you to go with this one. You didn't really need her Stephen and Wanda would have been enough. And Mordo is just there. The Cameos some are cool and others are meh. Overall Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness While does excel again with its style and visuals, the music by Danny Elfman is great. The characters do feel basic and the plot as a whole becomes more cluttered as the film Goes on.",11,9,EdwardtheBlackPrince,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur129636274/?ref_=tturv_usr_212_t,7-May-22,5,/10,

Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is a pretty good impression of the new generation on MCU. I will admit it does suffer as a bit of a downgrade from the first film due Scarlet Witch being a weak villain in this film even from her backstory. But the execution was able to take up for it with a solid story, great action, some of the good characters that give the events what we will see for the rest of the saga (which I won't spoil), and visuals that are strange in the best kind of way. Even though it's not as awesome as the first film, this would be a great idea to watch this to see what the Multiverse is like and what to expect what we will being seeing for this generation. After watching this, I should watch WandaVision someday. Seeing her in this film, I can tell the character has changed into a powerful one and I was starting to become curious how.

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8121101/?ref_=tturv_perm_217,Not sure how the Wanda weirdos will take this but I had fun,"In my review of Black Widow, I talked about how Marvel fans aren't generally that good at dealing with death.I wrote that death is so rare/weightless in the MCU that when someone finally becomes expendable enough to get killed off, the adult kids despair. I wrote that the actually meaningful deaths, e.g that of Black Widow, thus need to be alleviated by having the characters appear in prequels, lest the fangirls start a petition to resurrect them (as they did with Quicksilver) because God forbid anything in this canon actually poses a genuine threat to anyone.Something I failed to mention was the impending Multiverse saga. Now the possibilities are endless. Anyone we've had to bid farewell to can now very easily be brought back, long as we search within the right timeline, ""parallel universe"", or whatever.And in no Marvel property were loss and grief so crucial as in last year's WandaVision, where Wanda ""Scarlet Witch"" Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) dabbled in the interdimensional to possibly bring back the person -- or android -- she loves. In the well-made but oft-sloppy Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, she may just get her chance! The movies, after all, are still the ""real"" content.As much as I enjoyed WandaVision, it does largely exist as a set-up for this new biggie, where the titular Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) begins to explore the Multiverse -- following last year's Spider-Man shenanigans -- and the redoubtable Wanda uses her ever-evolving witchcraft to ""help"" (or so it seems at first). You'll recall that WandaVision hinted at a connection to a certain other Marvel-branded universe (not just an alternate MCU timeline) and that this particular plot point was ultimately a gag. But after No Way Home introduced that concept for realsies with its Peters Three, that's what we're doin'.I doubt that's a spoiler to anyone after the Super Bowl ad blew up on Twitter back in February and we learned that Patrick Stewart will reprise his role as Charles Xavier (?) from the X-Men film series -- which has such lousy continuity it may as well take place in its own Multiverse. We also see Baron Mordo (Chiwetel Ejiofor) again, as well as Shuma-Gorath, which, as a fan of Marvel vs. Capcom, is one of those character choices that actually got the geek within me kinda stoked. Xochitl Gomez plays newcomer America Chavez, whose superhero shtick is the fact that she's the only America Chavez across the Multiverse; her power is to journey between them.The movie isn't terrible. The visuals, as guaranteed by the very premise, are much more creative and striking than most MCU films (though some shots recall Thanos' usage of the Reality Gem in Avengers: Infinity War), but it's still about as safe and inoffensive as this kind of story will permit. Its best parts are the ones where Sam Raimi is allowed to go full ""Army of Darkness"" on our asses, taking a break from the Marvel Sludge™. I may even have gotten some feels during its climax.While it works fine on its own -- despite some glaring continuity issues -- and, on the flip side, its connections to other MCU plots are expected, I am left wondering what the latest mainline Marvel works TRULY have to do with each other.As of now, the Phase Four storylines don't acknowledge each other all that much -- even when it comes to, say, revelations on how the very cosmos they share functions (one second Kang is effectively God, the next it's the Celestials). Worse yet, they don't indicate any sort of common goal. Phase Two had similar problems, but even then, the endgame was clear. Here, some works head one way; some head another. Some works, even if they feel like skippable teases, add stuff of great importance, but this stuff only matters to this or that series.I'm starting to wonder if Kevin Feige still has a plan. Back in the day, even if the world-building was occasionally questionable, the MCU mostly held together and was clearly building toward the Infinity Saga. Even when the post-credit teasers were for solo adventures like Black Panther and Spider-Man: Homecoming, almost all movies seemed to look toward the same ultimate battle. Now, all kinds of universe-breaking things are being built up/teased, all of them going in different directions.Shang-Chi teased something huge with the Ten Rings that hasn't been elaborated upon (despite Benedict Wong, who made the urgent discovery, having appeared in two flicks since). Eternals introduced all kinds of crazy sh-t, but only really teased the Blade reboot without any sign we'll see the Eternals, say, have dinner with the Avengers (or that anyone gives a f-ck about the giant Celestial that almost burst through the planet à la Bionicle 4). All the Black Widow-Hawkeye stuff is kind of going its own way too. And while Loki indicated that the next MCU ""boss"" will be Kang the Conqueror, I now honestly doubt we'll see that many Avengers come together to fight him. He's in an Ant-Man movie next, for crying out loud!All that being said, I think Doctor Strange 2 works just fine as its own movie (taking better advantage of these concepts than the first Strange) and that it hints at interesting things to come. But really, the most rewarding part has been people's reactions to Wanda's lamentation (as seen in the Super Bowl ad) that she gets labeled a villain just because she broke the rules once:Some of us would point out that what she did to ""break the rules"", more precisely, was to mind-control an entire village into acting out her small-town fantasies. Others would reveal more than enough about themselves by either playing Wanda's Advocate (though their defenses would usually reduce themselves to ""Well, yes, BUT..."") or explicitly declare that Wanda could commit genocide and they would still ""stan"" this fictional comic-book lady -- which is a very normal and well-adjusted thing to base your personality/Twitter persona around. Take this with you the next time you worry Zoomers use the Internet too much; it's literally better for public safety that some people are terminally online.",6,4,TheVictoriousV,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur19932818/?ref_=tturv_usr_217_t,6-May-22,5,/10,

Sam Raimi goes ham on this movie.A script like this would not have worked in the hands of any other director. Raimi turns what could've been an incomprehensible mess into a visually inventive and occasionally gruesome adventure. The flaws in the script are still there, but the fantastic direction always makes sure you're not thinking too hard about them. This is easily the best directed movie in the MCU.The movie has fanservice for both Marvel and Sam Raimi fans. There are moments that are clearly direct references to the Evil Dead movies, and a number of comic book characters make suprise appearances.These moments surprisingly never distracted me from the story, which while often too chaotic for its own good, finds a strong anchor point in the emotional journeys of Stephen Strange and Wanda Maximoff.I have no idea how this movie will hold up on a rewatch, since it definitely has flaws, but right now, I'm just extremely happy to have an MCU film not afraid to let its director put every bit of themselves on screen.",12,14,mahmus,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur82462880/?ref_=tturv_usr_218_t,8-May-22,8,/10,

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8372834/?ref_=tturv_perm_223,Not such a strange Doctor I was waiting for...,"The advertising campaign and various conversations about the new film about Doctor Strange were going hard. However, after the cancellation of the release in Russia, there were no fewer YouTube videos from bloggers. It seemed that the project would be worthwhile. The expectation was especially great after the very successful ""Spider-Man 3"". But it is quite possible that high expectations played a cruel joke on me. Frankly speaking, I didn't like the film.The plot offers the viewer a confrontation between Stephen Strange and Wanda Maximoff, who wants to find her children who do not exist in her world in parallel dimensions. To fully understand the whole tragedy of the Scarlet Witch, it is necessary to see her solo series, which was released a year earlier. But even knowing about the story of a young girl, it is impossible to get into the current drama to the end. Wanda has suffered quite a few losses in her life, including Mercury and Vision, and then this complicated story with the whole town and her children. In the finale of ""Wanda/ Vision"", at least it was clear that the girl's psyche was so broken, what a tragedy it was for her to lose everything and, in fact, to be left alone with this problem. In the same film, we see the consequences of how dangerous the situation can be, first of all, for the person himself, who was left without support with his losses. However, the serial strong line of Wanda's intrapersonal problems in the ""Multiverse of Madness"" is fading. She doesn't have that strength, and I, as a spectator, simply don't believe the girl and her trouble, although I can even imagine what it's like for her. But I don't have to imagine and think. Experienced screenwriters and director Sam Raimi had to twist this nerve so that no one would have any doubts - Wanda is suffering and going crazy with grief.As a result, in the film about Doctor Strange, I mostly saw the story of the Scarlet Witch. This is a mistake, because there was a bias in their joint history. On the other hand, the complicated history of the relationship between Stephen and his long-time lover Christina Palmer, who is going to marry another, absolutely passes by. Again, it feels like they want to show us the difficult experiences of Strange, but this is done in a hurry and badly twisted. As a result, you conclude that the creators of the film were in a hurry somewhere. You bet. The film seems to have been remade, sent for reshoots, shortened such a large-scale project to two hours on the screen. And all this is felt: the ragged rhythm of the narrative, the weak elaboration of the characters. But Raimi was happy to disperse in his horror themes, which were well represented here to the extent that the rating of the film and the philosophy of the film comic as a whole allowed. In a couple of moments it was really creepy. Hardly anyone missed the second when the deadly Wanda looked straight into their eyes, as if punching through our universe.The audience was very much waiting for some of the heroes. What was their surprise and disappointment when, in fact, it turned out to be just a cameo, and even with such a plot development, when you don't have time to really get acquainted with the characters yet, and they are already leaving the narrative, because you should return to the main storyline. It is clear that this was done specifically for fans, but you need to focus on the entire audience of the film.The film, of course, came out colorful, but fast. The multiverse, in my opinion, was little disclosed. So many worlds have been presented here, but we have not stopped at least a few to show how they differ from what we are used to. It is clear that this could not be the goal, but the presented material was clearly not enough.Some scenes and dialogues look frankly weak or even strange. ""Musical fight"" made me think a couple of times, but I'm definitely not watching some kind of fake. It's just that Marvel's decision wasn't like them at all. Even if such a fight, like it was in the comics, seemed frankly unnecessary to me in the movie.The film is generally not bad. But I was disappointed. I was waiting for a much larger project with a clear confrontation and more competently written characters. In the end, the story did not impress, remaining somewhere on the sidelines in front of the visual. But as you know, in the modern world, you can't go out on special effects and a beautiful picture alone. We have long been accustomed to the modern possibilities of graphics and drawn worlds. History itself should prevail after all. But it's definitely worth noting that the artists of the painting did their best, showing the audience amazing fantastic locations that they really wanted to explore. Who knows. Maybe Marvel will lead us to this one day, showing in some hypothetical ""Avengers 5"" a whole multiverse war, where different worlds will be revealed much better.6 out of 10.",0,0,alekspredator87,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur52780913/?ref_=tturv_usr_223_t,26-Jul-22,6,/10,

Overall, a highly anticipated Marvel movie that plays too strongly to its predecessors as it is very formulaic in the MCU boilerplate and has pretty poor writing overall, but has some highlights when it comes to acting, direction, visuals, and new stylistic choices that make it a bit different from other MCU movies (even though by not a lot).Good Direction (Was able to take control of the different action scenes as well as the different character building scenes, all while sprinkling in different elements of horror that makes Sam Raimi famous), Good Acting (Very good from Benedict Cumberbatch (Continued his role as he now has the weight of carrying the Marvel franchise in this new phase), Good from Elizabeth Olsen (While there were many holes/I did not like her character, Olsen did a good job in trying to portray what they were going for in Wanda in this movie), Good from Benedict Wong (Standard Wong), Very Good from Xochitl Gomez (I really enjoyed her performance as she played the teenage character with potential archetype very well (and I look forward to seeing more America Chavez in latter MCU content)), Good from Rachel McAdams (played the ex-love interest very well), Good from the rest of the cast), Pretty Bad Story (The entire story was very formulaic and easy to predict (took from the standard comic book boilerplate), and the Wanda Storyline was very poorly written to the point that it was more annoying than entertaining; also, there were many plot holes when it came to the multiverse), Decent Screenplay (Typical Marvel Dialogue but there were many questionable lines that were more cringey than entertaining), Good Score, Very Good Cinematography, Very Good Sound, Very Good Editing, Great Visual Effects (Similar to previous Doctor Strange), Good Costumes, Plot Structure was very formulaic as it followed the standard MCU/Superhero boilerplate (But it spends way too much time in the exposition to where the rest of the movie does not have that much time), Pacing was incredibly fast as the shortened runtime was easy to see (would have liked to have seen 20 minutes added towards the rising action), Build to climax stood out and had good moments despite being overall pretty standard MCU; climax was the typical MCU climax (but had some moments that were very cringey), Tone was the standard MCU tone (but I did enjoy some of the horror touches and homage to his earlier horror films)",1,2,cinemapersonified,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur82414298/?ref_=tturv_usr_225_t,13-Jun-23,6,/10,

With that, the violence is harsher than other Marvel movies, though it doesn't quite have the R rating. Probably would have an R rating if it had just a little bit more blood and gore.It does feature more of Wanda being Scarlet Witch. The power of the Scarlet Witch is more tested in this alongside WandaVision, where Wanda actually becomes the Scarlet Witch.It does also feature the live action debut of America Chavez, the Hispanic heroine who has the power to travel the multiverse. It features more of her origin in the MCU. It does seem like she's more of a plot device in the film. She's the character who moves the plot forward and the other characters are the ones who got more development.Multiverse of Madness is more of the appetizer for the Multiverse Saga while Avengers Secret Wars would be more of the main course. I would expect more universe hopping and characters from different universes from the next two Avengers films. Though that makes it seem more madness than multiverse. I just expected it to be more of an appetizer, so I'm not really disappointed for it having too little universes they're in
I do like the general feel to it. I like the combination of the magic of Doctor Strange and a small bit of horror dashed in. I'll be ok if Doctor Strange 3 would have a similar direction. Though I do prefer the first.Speaking of Doctor Strange 3, there is room for a third Doctor Strange. I hope they're working on a third and they release it before Secret Wars (maybe Doomsday as well but it's alright if it's one of the films released between the two).",0,1,auskooper,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur168372141/?ref_=tturv_usr_228_t,12-Oct-24,8,/10,

This is also a bit different, as it dips slightly into horror territory, with demons, monsters and zombies - it is directed by Sam Raimi, from the original Spider-Man films, but also 'Evil Dead' fame.The plot follows new character America (Gomez) and her teleporting power and what that has to do with Strange, Wong (Wong) and Wanda (Olsen). This film follows along the lines of what happened in 'WandaVision', 'Loki' and 'No Way Home', so it should be no surprise to viewers with all the interdimensional hopping, magic and psychedelic ""other worlds"" in this film. It's good to see some of the alternate Strange's and the other characters they chose to show us.While not actually horrific or scary - even though there's a few minor-shocks - it's certainly quite dark and tragic, with the Scarlet Witch storyline being quite well-done, even if it leaves little room for humour or fun. It's good to have McAdams back and she gets some screentime. Cumberbatch is good, but Olsen practically carries the film.

#DrStrangeInTheMultiverseOfMadnessSam Raimi once again returns to the Marvel fold to direct this film. In this film, we join Dr. Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) shortly after the events of Spiderman ,No Way Home as he encounters a mysterious traveller ""America Chavez"" (an excellent Xochitl Gomez) who has reached our version of Earth after being chased across Multiverse's by a mysterious unknown entity. Strange, alongside the Sorcerer Supreme, Wong (Benedict Wong) embark on a journey across the known & unknown Universe's to uncover the truth. Who is America Chavez? What power does she hold and Why is she being relentlessly chased by the entity is what the film is all about .The film can be confusing for the uninitiated as it has references to previous Marvel movies.However, the fast paced narrative , awesome VFX & fantastic BGM make it a memorable experience overall.The combination of Raimi and Cumberbatch has given us a winner for sure.

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8119566/?ref_=tturv_perm_241,"A visually arresting, eerily poignant tale of multiversal proportions!","Marvel has well and truly embraced the realm of psychological turmoil and mind-bending narratives, first by conjuring up the infinite possibilities of the multiverse in ""Spiderman: No Way Home (2021)"" and then following that up with the nerve-rackingly psychedelic ""Moon Knight"" series. The Master of the Mystic Arts faces the repercussion of his multiverse-opening antics in this eerily engaging visual extravaganza, with a decadent amount of surprise guest appearances and a poignant storyline that will closely resonate with fans of the MCU.Veteran auteur Sam Raimi returns to the director's chair in ""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness"" after having spearheaded the rise of the genre with his groundbreaking ""Spider-Man"" trilogy (2002-07) starring Tobey Maguire. The aesthetically arresting style of the director combined with two ace performers in Oscar-nominee Benedict Cumberbatch and Elizabeth Olsen deliver a riveting saga of coping with loss and the universe-altering ends one will go to to repair a broken heart.We join Doctor Strange after the events of No Way Home, having encountered a mysterious traveller ""America Chavez"" (an excellent Xochitl Gomez) who reached our version of Earth after being chased across multiverses by a mysterious unknown entity. Strange, alongside the Sorcerer Supreme, Wong (Benedict Wong) embark on a journey across the known and unknown universe and across the legends of sorcery and witchcraft to get to the truth, recruiting a morose ""Scarlett Witch"" (Olsen), still reeling after her tumultuous sojourn in the Disney+ series, ""Wanda Vision"".Cumberbatch is a revelation as Dr. Strange, portraying the angst and confusion of a man who returned after getting 5 years of his life erased away by Thanos' snap, with elan. He finds that the world has moved on in his absence, especially his former lady-love, Christine (Rachel McAdams) and we get to see the human side of the world's most powerful sorcerer while he comes to grips with his predicaments. As Dr. Strange embarks on a perilous adventure across multiverses, we get to see the immense range of Cumberbatch in full flow, with the nuances and intricacies he brings to each version of the master sorcerer in the different worlds we visit, a joy to behold.Elizabeth Olsen continues the fine form she displayed in ""Wanda Vision"", delivering a perfectly balanced performance that is equal parts poignant and powerful. Oscar-nominee Chiewetel Ejiofor returns as Dr. Strange's bête noire, ""Mordo"", in a short but impactful cameo. Without giving much away, let me just say that the dizzying array of other surprise cameos not only provide several whistle-worthy moments in the theatre but also gel in well with the narrative structure.Doctor Strange's second stand-alone movie is a fitting addition to Marvel's darker, murkier Phase 4 where we get to explore the inner psyche of our heroes at a deeper level and is more reliant on its performances than on being spectacle-driven. That being said, the CGI and visual effects are nothing short of mesmerizing as we journey along with our heroes across multiverses, with the storyline opening up an infinite array of potential spin-offs and future tie-ins featuring our favourite heroes from franchises long past as well as promising new ones down the line. A must-watch in theatres. Highly recommended!

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8121633/?ref_=tturv_perm_249,Well it certainly feels like a Sam Raimi movie,"I enjoyed the first Doctor Strange film even though it followed the same format of superhero origin stories. The exploration of the magic side was just an interesting aspect of the universe and I just love how they portrayed it visually. So I was gutted when the director of the original, Scott Derrickson, left the project. However, it was then revealed that legendary director Sam Raimi, director of the Evil Dead and Spider-Man trilogy, would direct it and I was super excited again. So does it deliver a multiverse of fun or is it a multiverse of dullness?Firstly, this is definitely a Sam Raimi movie. All the usual flairs that you would expect from him are completely in here and I love it. The stylistic way he shoots a scene, the way he portrays New York feels like what he did in Spider-Man, the slight goofiness, the horror elements and jump scares are all here. There are some great visuals during the magic sequence and multiverse stuff. There are also some horrific scenes that genuinely surprised me as it felt too gruesome for a PG 13 movie. It's a Sam Raimi film through and through and his direction elevates this movie to new heights.There are also some great action set pieces that were very creative and a blast to watch. The music is composed by Danny Elfman and he does a great job. There is a fun action sequence with the use of music and Danny does a great job with the music score to illustrate that battle. The actors are also all doing a great job. Benedict Cumberbatch is still the perfect Doctor Strange and delivers on every scene. I also love how he portrays the other Doctor Strange variants from other universes. Benedict Wong is great and his chemistry with the other Benedict is still fun to watch. Rachel McAdams returns as Christine but unlike the first film she has more to do this time and I appreciate that since she is wonderful in the role. Xochitl Gomez is good as America Chavez and I like her interaction with Doctor Strange. The other supporting cast does a good job as well even with their small screen time. The biggest standout is Elisabeth Olsen as Wanda. She does a phenomenal job in her performance. I just love how she did in every scene from the emotional to the scary. She is the core of this film.However, that is also part of the reason I didn't enjoy the story as much. For a movie titled Doctor Strange, he isn't even the complete focus of the plot as he shares equal screen time with Wanda as well as having to share it with America Chavez as well. All 3 of them have story arcs but none are done to a satisfying degree. Strange still loves Christine, Wanda still loves her children, and Chavez doesn't trust Strange and this is their character for almost the whole of the movie. They all lack proper characterization and depth which makes them all feel one dimensional. Chavez ends up feeling like a MacGuffin for the plot and a person to spout exposition, rather than an interesting foil to Strange or Wanda. There is also a pacing drop around the second act where it is just a lot of walking and talking which went on for a bit too long. Ended up making the movie feel longer than it is. The ending is also great and very Sam Raimi but the mid-credit scene just undoes any impact of the ending and that is such a shame.Overall, I am thrilled by the return of Sam Raimi to the superhero genre. While the screenplay lets the movie down a bit, Sam Raimi was still able to make this movie feel unique. It's clear that the MCU didn't restrain Sam's wackiness and I am glad about that. Thanks to his amazing direction and the terrific performance from the cast, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness ends up being extremely fun to watch.",9,10,MovieWarfare,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur112855274/?ref_=tturv_usr_249_t,6-May-22,7,/10,

Cumberbatch too is always watchable, but is really just collecting his pay check at this point. Ejiofor is tolerable, and despite some cringe level token diversity casting among the minor characters, the (White European) Gomez isn't awful, although her performance is completely bland and forgettable.I focus on the actors because it's all downhill from there.The writing is simply dreadful. There's no narrative arc, just two hours of chase and snuff told in a series of essentially unrelated ""and then, and then, and then"" scenes. Characterisation is minimal, and the dialogue is almost pure exposition with no memorable lines.Visual effects are fair except for a bizarrely modelled octopus creature which is inexplicably Harryhausen in appearance. If they had a point to make with it, it wasn't explained. Costumes and makeup are decent, although the Raimi deadite motifs are mere pastiches.The score is appalling, being a near constant barrage of overblown blaring which drowns out the dialog and any possibility of emotional investment.

I'm more a fan of the traditional superhero crime fighters that wizards and witches. I enjoyed the visual style of the first Dr. Strange but the film wasn't very involving. When I saw that Sam Raimi was the director of this new film I was very happy with that because Raimi is a good choice for this kind of story. He has a visual style and sense of humor that is uniquely his so I had elevated expatations.We I saw the new film today and I do feel it is an improvement on the first Dr. Strange. The character is still not my favorite character but
Benedict Cumberbatch has made the character his own. The cast is pretty good also. Especially Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda Maximoff. Xochitl Gomez plays America Gomez. A being that has the power to travel through the multiverse. She tells Strange that she is being chased by demons because of her power. It turns Wanda is responsible for the attacks so Dr Strange tried to protect America. To explain what goes on would be difficult and their lies one of my problems with the film. Because this is a multiverse story where there are alternate realities and you see different versions of the same character it's hard to get really involved with the story on an emotional level. There is too much going on to get involved with the characters. It is a Marvel film but I think they are so much better when you care about the what's going on with the characters in the story. Sam Raimi directs this with great energy and does add horror elements which are his specialty but I wish he would have been given some more control. I suspect he was held back by studio execs on not going to far with some of the more disturbing elements of the story.Overall it is an entertaining Marvel film though.Grade: B.",2,9,flicklover,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0266568/?ref_=tturv_usr_254_t,8-May-22,8,/10,

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8118847/?ref_=tturv_perm_256,"Stellar direction, clumsy writing.","Sorry for the long review, but this is a strange one. I have a lot to say.The MCU now has its first horror film. And it's director Sam Raimi REALLY elevates the material above the standard superhero fare that's on the page.With Raimi's experience directing horror comedies, he adds an incredibly fun sensory experience to every scene in the film. The action is over-the-top and even the dramatic scenes have a distinctly heightened visual and auditory nature to them that makes them far more impactful and made me feel something.Raimi also makes the villain legitimately scary as she brutally tears through her enemies. There are some very effective jump scare sequences that never feel cheap; they always elevate tension and the sense of danger. This has some of the most intense, graphic violence I have ever seen in a PG-13 movie. This movie is NOT for the young children.This film's other strength is in its villain. Wanda's development is handled far better in this movie than it was in Wandavision, and even though her decisions are irrational, we clearly understand them. She's in the top-tier of MCU villains.This is where the positives end, unfortunately, because the writing in this movie is largely abysmally idiotic.The plot is almost entirely contrived and treats its characters like intellectually bereft morons. Just about every single event in the film happens because characters do what the plot needs them to and not what any actual person with half a brain would do.Every character except Wanda is simply a plot device and does not add the emotional weight to the story that they should have. In fact, this story is almost entirely driven by a series of objects that need to be obtained and the human heart that should be there only shows up occasionally.The pacing in this movie is also so sloppy. The entire middle portion of the story consists of characters waiting for something to happen, and a pseudo-courtroom drama ensues that is completely irrelevant to the main story. I found myself just wanting the signature Raimi fast pace to come back.It's a mixed bag of a movie, but there's definitely more to like than not to like, and I praise it for actually having a distinct atmosphere-like an artist was behind the camera rather than just some executives trying to churn out another episode of the MCU.",8,8,benjaminskylerhill,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur117768316/?ref_=tturv_usr_256_t,6-May-22,6,/10,

I do have one good thing to mention before the mess, the special effects were spot on, and I am saying this because a lot of the latest big budget Marvel movies had awful CGI but at least they got that part right on this one.The plot is just simply not good, for one thing it's very rushed and it doesn't feel like a Doctor Strange or even a Marvel movie at all to be honest. The monsters, dimensions and powers (aside from the stuff we've seen in previous films) are generic, basic and most of them inexplicable, I get it, it's the Multiverse and anything goes there are no rules, but the feeling I got is that this is being used as an excuse for lazy writing.Without giving much spoilers the villain (although it was set up before) doesn't convince me and became too dark to quickly, the cameos were pointless and their only purpose was fan service, and the finale setting up a continuation for this mess was the final cherry on top of the bad.It's a messy movie ironically with a basic plot, I felt detached from familiar characters and the future is not promising at all, again they will never drop such a profitable project but things have their time and I am afraid quality will continue to drop.",0,0,thePopcornExplorer,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur36922988/?ref_=tturv_usr_261_t,24-Jun-22,5,/10,

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8167985/?ref_=tturv_perm_266,A strange compilation of loud scenes,"Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness (2022)2/4As a movie on its own, this movie doesn't work. It is ridiculous. The movie is a loud, obnoxious piece of big budgeted Disney-Marvel entertainment; full of style, but no substance to keep everything going. It is a disappointment, considering the talent involved, particularly Sam Raimi, director of 'The Evil Dead' and the original Tobey Maguire 'Spider-Man' movies. He is a man of intense visual style, a filmmaker of great composure and interest - he's always been one of my favorite directors for it. Unfortunately, the movie is a massive disappointment, and what is most disappointing is that Sam Raimi was unable to hold himself together through the out of control story and unintelligible plot and Marvel mythology. It is ponderous, predictable, tedious, and sometimes even boring. It just goes on and on and on... it's like it almost never ends.Where shall I start with the plot? I don't know, because I don't really know the plot. Here is what (I think) happened - I'll try to do my best. The movie follows Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) as he teams up with a teenage girl who he recognizes from his own dreams who can travel through Multiverses. Slowly, they fight threats to the Multiverse itself.There are many flaws. The characters all act strange; Cumberbatch plays his character as a sort of one-dimensional hero, and many others feel like pieces of cardboard rather than likable characters. The story is completely off the wall; messy is a word to describe it; the movie just seems to be a bunch of random scenes put together by a screenplay that barely strings it all together. It's one of those movies you could turn on at any time, and still not know what was going on. The script is stupid and juvenile, and it is just not quite enough to keep me involved and interested.There are many more flaws, but the only reason the film is receiving two stars instead of one is because of director Sam Raimi's undeniable stylistic impact. It is full of vibrant and visual color, complete with slick design. The palette of the movie's visuals are superb; the visuals stunning, and the cinematography breathtaking. But, unfortunately, it doesn't quite save the movie from the slow and unintelligible tempo.In total, it's a massive disappointment, and must surely be among the MCU's worst.",2,2,redcrossaint,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur119124198/?ref_=tturv_usr_266_t,23-May-22,5,/10,

Both times I was blown away. While it's not nearly as great as ""No Way Home"" it still gives a lot to look forward to. In my books it equals ""Doctor Strange"" (2016) in terms of rating 81 (2016) v 82 (2022).Hard to write and not spoil, but the expanded idea of the multiverse is fascinating bringing in other realities that you would figure exist if there was only a singular verse, but it doesn't because of conflicting backgrounds. (If you've seen the film hopefully that makes sense)The acting was terrific by the experienced Benedict Cumberbatch, great by the getting there Elizabeth Olson, and alright by newcomer Xochitl Gomez. I believe she'll come into her being the more she plays America Chavez, but her performance was good enough that I look forward to seeing her again in the role.The cinematography, and especially the score, we're insane. Absolutely chaotic, but enhanced the senses in ways that some MCU films fail to capture. Some of the camera shots within the other dimensions were stomach churning, or headache giving, as they went in circles. However, can't complain too much.Perhaps the biggest negative is how quickly certain things took place. There wasn't much build up to the villain and the end scenes felt unnecessarily rushed. A three hour movie with relevant scenes would've been more appropriate than the two hour movie it was, crunched together.Overall, it was an excellent movie. I'd recommend checking it out in IMAX if you can. The score was incredible. Expansion of the multiverse was pretty incredible to see, but could've been more in-depth.Thank you for reading my review.

1. Elizabeth Olsen (Wanda Maximoff/ The Scarlet Witch) gives a really amazing performance. She nails the emotional arc of The Scarlet Witch/ Wanda Maximoff.2. There were Sam Raimi (Director) horror undertones, with the help of well-timed jump-scares, and they help to keep you on edge.3. The fight scenes, for the most part, are fun and engaging.4. The Scarlet Witch makes for a brilliant villain with her emotional pull, complexity and ruthlessness.Cons:
1. Some of the CGI is really bad. For example, the third eye on Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) looks like it's just been copy-and-pasted.2. The information Wong (Benedict Wong) gives to The Scarlet Witch on the Dark Hold seems to be done, just to set up the tower setting. Which is bizarre, because she went to the length of attacking the sorcerer stronghold for said information.3. Jett Klyne (Tommy Maximoff) and Julian Hilliard (Billy Maximoff) both deliver wooden performances.4. The new heroes introduced are extremely underwhelming. They're introduced, and then pretty much killed off in the next scene, leaving their introduction pointless.5. There's not enough focus on the multiverse. The characters just hop from one different universe to the next, with little aim. The multiverse ended up feeing like a gimmick, rather than a relevant plot point.6. The new Professor Charles Xavier wheelchair looks utterly ridiculous; it looks like it belongs on Pimp My Ride.7. The musical note fight scene between two Doctor Strange's from different universes was just plain bizarre and distracting.8.

But I went in after reading reviews praising it for being ""signature Sam Raimi"", ""very weird"" and ""surprisingly violent."" And some of that is sort of true, I guess.The Raimi stylization feels more like that ""Say the line, Bart!"" meme. He has a unmistakable little song and dance, and he's playing to the crowd by leaning in to his own gimmicks to the point where it almost feels like a parody of Sam Raimi. I don't know if that's a complaint. Maybe it isn't?The movie was not weird enough and not violent enough for my expectations. Multiverses are not as weird as Marvel thinks they are. They have spent a long, long time (multiple movies!) easing people in to the concept like nobody's going to understand it. They do a couple of fun things with the idea here, but it feels pretty reserved. I wanted weirder, wackier, more imaginative. For a ""multiverse of madness"" the scope here is pretty small.As for the violence, the easiest way for me to describe this movie is that it's very clear they are trying to keep a PG-13 rating. There's implied violence, and implied blood, but they always make sure dance around the subject matter so that it's never actually bloody or violent. I don't really care, I'm not one of those gorehounds, but it's just about the expectation, and given what I expected, I got something that was a little softball.The real problem with this movie is the structure, I guess? It is a movie where a lot of things happen but it almost feels like its being made up as it goes. Good movies build up a concept, like they're chasing an idea that's bigger and wider than just what happens on screen. Like, Jurassic Park is about more than just dinosaurs eating people, and the movie is structured around a metaphor of learning, growth and change, both for the characters in the movie and the audience.Strange 2... doesn't do that? It is a terribly blunt, straightforward movie. Everything is this bizarre stream of consciousness where there is very little foreshadowing, no setups or payoffs to anything. It hits the ground running with things happening, and when there are no more things left to happen, it ends. It's like the whole movie is one big budget improv routine. It's very bizarre.And yet I still think I liked it? Strange indeed.",3,1,Blazehgehg,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2054447/?ref_=tturv_usr_274_t,14-Jul-22,7,/10,

So nothing I can fault casting wise as the whole cast did really great work. The actress playing America Chavez newcomer she may be but really impressed with her acting in the movie.In terms of special effects and sounds, well it's a Marvel film with the budget that comes attached to that. Absolutely brilliant visuals and audio throughout the movie.In terms of story well, it's basically Wanda gone evil apparently from something which happened in her WandaVision show (Haven't watched it but heard what happened in it from family.). The story overall is pretty good though it feels very rushed to me, like the movie needed another hour to it at least to try give all its characters some meat rather then just leave them hanging bare bones in front of the audience.While the title says Dr Strange in it, It honestly feels misleading. A more apt title would be America Chavez or Stepping Stone/Setup Film for future marvel projects. While this film had Dr Strange as its main character it just didn't feel like he was the main character in the movie. He is still there in nearly every frame but if the film was called America Chavez & The Multiverse Of Madness or something it would probably have worked as well.Anyway enough of me going on about how it's a Doctor Strange film but feels like something else, the movie is still fun and really enjoyable to watch. It has a great cast and all the Special Effects money can buy. The story is a bit mad and kinda confusing at times but followable for the most part. A solid 7/10 from me!P. S.

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8130042/?ref_=tturv_perm_291,There's a lot to talk about here,"Doctor Strange and Scarlet Witch are my two absolute favorite Marvel characters, going right back to the comics, so having them both play lead roles in the same big movie is kind of a dream come true. I've been waiting for this one. So does it measure up? First off, it has the same high-level production values we now expect, and then some; this is a special effects riot going almost into sensory overload. There's enough in the way of action scenes to satisfy anyone in the popcorn brigade, lots of characters to follow, and an extended centerpiece 'Illuminati' sequence that is in danger of just tipping over into pure fan-service territory but somehow manages to be more than just a crazy detour -- it actually moves the storyline forward.And before I forget to mention it -- the mid-credits scene was *exactly* what I was hoping for! Introducing, with flair, a central, long-time character from Dr. Strange's comics history who ought to have been there right from his first movie. I just wanted more and I wonder if this might set up not Doctor Strange #3 but a limited streaming series instead. Why not? The MCU did big stuff with WandaVision and What If and Loki, so ... why not this? A great storyline awaits.And the acting is never less than good. Benedict Cumberbatch has the basics of the title role down pat, and the script gives him a little extra time (not much, unfortunately -- it would have been a better film to do more) to expand the emotional range of the good Doctor and humanize him a bit more. Elizabeth Olsen as the co-lead might be the standout though --she is a very fine actor and her nuanced expressions are worth just as much as her dialog. Newcomer Xochitl Gomez doesn't have a very complex job to do but is perfectly fine playing someone who is basically just a scared kid on the run. But one thing that pleasantly surprised me was Rachel McAdams; I thought her Christine Palmer character was going to be just a short sidelight, but she (or actually, one of her multiverse analogs) had a satisfyingly big role to play.Visually, they really lean in to the multiverse concept where no matter what you dream or imagine it's out there somewhere. I'm still left wanting more (for example, in the early Steve Ditko/Stan Lee comics they imagined mystic landscapes built out of nothing but geometric shapes and magic portals) but it is a step forward from Strange #1. And there's a fun ""wizard's duel"" scene where the weapons are sharpened musical notes and sound bites. More of that kind of thing would have been great.New concepts are important too. Credit to the writers for using dream and dreaming as a running theme and for coming up with the idea of 'dream-walking' as a way of travelling the multiverse, if you can control it properly. Turns out it takes a lot of discipline and focus to be a first-rate villain, as we see here. On the other hand, there's Wundagore Mountain, which seems completely out of place. In the comics it's the home of the High Evolutionary and generally a place for good. Here in the movie they turn it into a nexus of evil. I guess they just thought the name was cool.OK, now to talk about the real central issue of the film. If you haven't seen it yet, don't read on! This is your SPOILER ALERT.So here we go.Marvel did an incredible job of keeping all this under wraps right up to general release: the main villain is, in fact, Wanda. The reason given in the story is perfectly clear -- the Darkhold book last seen in WandaVision has given her not just enhanced power but corrupted her mind. Delving into it was a big mistake. Without it, it's implied, she'd have gradually come to terms with the loss of her fantasy children (and husband) and at least have stayed on the side of good. That's the condition we last saw her in at the end of WandaVision. Her central tragedy is that she now has the ability to get what she wants, i.e. Access to the multiverse where somewhere her two boys are real.I guess it's obvious that they didn't have to do this to her. Can't she EVER catch a break? She lost her parents, her brother, her husband, her idyllic homelife and children (that admittedly were of her own imagining). Enough already! It borrows a lot from some of the recent comics, where Wanda essentially goes insane and releases destructive magic at a world-changing level (though in the comics, nobody ever stays permanently dead and there's no path that can't be rewritten). There are a number of pretty troubling messages here not far under the surface. For example, that a woman who's too powerful must be destroyed? (Remember Phoenix?) This all seems misogynistic in the extreme. Just two days after the movie released I've already seen pro reviewers out there rip the writers for exactly this, and for sure there will be more.On the other hand: why *can't* the Big Bad Villain be a female? In the MCU we've already had Thanos, Ultron, the Mandarin, Doc Ock, Green Goblin, Zemo, Magneto, and a bunch more. Isn't it a weird but valid sort of gender equity to have a woman play such a role? Are we still that stuck in stereotypes? What about ""Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned""? No. Hell hath no fury like a mother who's lost her children. This is a kind of motivation that is purely a woman's, so why not run with it? Oddly enough, old Disney movies are no strangers to evil witches; I guess they were either way before or way behind their time.The main problem I'm left with is that I would have been a lot happier if Wanda had been a protagonist and the pair of them fought a common enemy. I just want to see her on the side of good. Which, by the very end, she is, but it looks like the only way we'll see her again is through a multiversal, less powered version of her. I hope so because she's a great character to work with. But maybe that's just something for me to adjust to. The path the production crew chose to go with was one of the logical possibilities coming out of WandaVision, just not the one I would have preferred.",4,5,gcsman,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur66541531/?ref_=tturv_usr_291_t,9-May-22,9,/10,

Still, the story is cumbersome, protagonists are underdeveloped, and dialogue is unnatural. The plot is straightforward (villains trying to capture a kid), yet there's so much complicated exposition that Multiverse of Madness feels laborious. Plus, that significant groundwork leaves little time to explore the characters. Strange gets some emotional moments and Wanda is powerfully motivated, but that's it. Furthermore, the only actor with enticing material is Olsen. Despite all this, Multiverse of Madness connects because of its trippy elements and heartfelt touches.Meanwhile, Multiverse of Madness is the most artistic MCU film because Raimi's personality shines through. There is camera movement, suggestive framing, and dramatic lighting. There are beautiful match cuts, striking dissolves, and clever transitions. These techniques set a psychological mood that suits the narrative. Moreover, the sound is complex, symbolic, and creepy. Also, the music heightens adventure and punctuates horror. This is all harmonized by unique direction and production, which cohesively blends clean MCU, bizarre multiverses, and horror undertones. Overall, Multiverse of Madness overcomes its bloated script and MCU ties with fair drama and eccentric craft.Writing: 6/10

There are a lot of extended horror-inspired scenes (with director Sam Raimi clearly going back to his roots). My 13yo and 15yo were both surprised by how intense this is at times. Younger children may well find it downright scary.Now onto the film. Visually and sonically it is spectacular. A creative tour de force that the technical teams should be very proud of.But that's it's problem. It's just a technical success. The story (and most importantly the characterisations) are really thin.Now I'll confess that I always have a problem with superhero films that fall into the ""most powerful being in the universe"" trope. As soon as someone is that powerful, all tension disappears. They can just destroy everything if they want to, after all, so why are they messing around with endless force-field battles with one another?You just end up with two hours of all-powerful beings jumping from universe to universe and engaging in increasingly boring conversations about the multiverse and the power of witchcraft. With the action/horror sequences getting increasingly silly as time goes on.It does sort-of tie in with Wandavision and it does have a sequence in the middle that is clearly aimed at Marvel superfans, so if you are fully signed up to the franchise you'll get more from it than I did.But as a casual filmgoer it is disappointing.

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8195644/?ref_=tturv_perm_318,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness Review,"Probably the most underrated MCU film in my opinion and one of the more underrated Sam Raimi films. This film is an absolute blast to watch. I was very skeptical beforehand about this being a cameo fest film and while there were some cameos, it was relegated to one section of the film and there weren't a lot of them. Plus they use those cameo characters in an interesting way. This isn't perfect by any means and the script is easily the weakest part of the film. The dialogue is definitely VERY rough around the edges and it definitely could have used another rewrite or two but oh my god the directing, performances, and characters are great. I really enjoyed seeing Doctor Strange's and Wanda's arcs in this film. Both coming to terms with what they have lost. I really loved that Wanda was the villain of the film. I really wanted WandaVision to go in that direction but it didn't and it seems that this film rectified that decision and saying what Wanda did in her show wasn't okay. It's safe to say here that all of the performances are great. Benedict Cumberbatch is still doing a great job as Strange and Elizabeth Olsen shines as Wanda but Xochitl Gomez shines as America Chavez. I hope we see more of her in the future. My absolute favorite aspect of this film is Sam Raimi's direction. It truly feels that Kevin Feige just told Sam Raimi to do whatever he wanted as long as he followed the script and my god did he deliver. Besides the first hour, this film is screaming that this is his film. The camera movements, the horror elements, and especially the gore. There was a surprising amount of violence in this film that I didn't expect to see from the MCU and it was definitely a welcome decision. I do believe though that this film would be so much better if the dialogue was ironed out more but this is so much fun that I can't hate on it too much. The second post credit scene is also one of my favorites in the MCU however it really only works if you've seen Raimi's other films. Definitely go check this out if you're an MCU fan and especially if you are a Raimi fan. You won't be disappointed.",2,2,theredsky,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur101697549/?ref_=tturv_usr_318_t,2-Jun-22,7,/10,
https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8121615/?ref_=tturv_perm_319,If you thought No Way Home was heavy on fan service,"Sam Raimi was the right director for this project. I went into this with very low expectations and really just reluctant to watch, and it didn't help that I bought the tickets for a 3D showing. It really wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be.The turmoil surrounding the production of this film really painted a bleak picture for me going into this. I don't remember how many directors and writers they went through before settling on Sam Raimi. I do remember that this was originally going to be a horror film and I think it would have been much better if they stuck with an R rated horror film instead of this superhero film ""with horror elements"" that we got. But since they went with a weird genre mix, getting Sam Raimi was an excellent choice. His background in horror and work with Spider-Man (specifically the second one) really helped this film feel coherent, and I don't think many other directors could have done such a job with the awkward parameters forced by Disney.That being said I had almost no idea what was happening in a lot of the action sequences (and really most of the CGI heavy parts). I have seen the first Doctor Strange so I knew to expect a CGI reality bending extravaganza. But this film isn't as impressive in that aspect as I remember the first one being, though I have not watched the first one since I saw it in theaters. I really don't like time travel films and while this isn't one I still felt a little bit annoyed in a similar way.The plot is Strange fighting the Scarlet Witch across multiple realities to save a girl who can travel across the multiverse so that Wanda won't take her powers to travel to different universes. Just typing that out makes my brain a little bit sad, even more so considering the real point of the film was to have callbacks to different movies and characters that will be in other movies. It's literally just a self referential film that bends over backwards to capitalize on fan service and it really just feels gross and annoying. This film is literally everything that The Matrix: Resurrections (2021) parodied which just made me laugh at how stupid that entire concept is. So this film being such a corporate ploy made me like that film more.This film reminding me of another better film isn't surprising considering how much this film pays homage to the classics that we all know of. I don't know if it was Raimi or Disney that decided to remake classic shots and scenes from horror (and just general film) history, though I would guess Disney, but it really limits the potential for the film. You can tell they didn't want to try anything new or take any risks for this film. They relied heavily on references and fan service, which makes for an incredibly uninspiring film.The ""horror elements"" in this film make me wish they would have went all in on a true horror film instead of this nonsense. But it isn't complete trash, which is really par for the MCU. It's a watchable film that could have been better. I don't think I'll ever watch this film again because it is so uninteresting.",1,8,Dominic_25_,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur152062879/?ref_=tturv_usr_319_t,6-May-22,5,/10,

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9540341/?ref_=tturv_perm_325,Despite being utter nonsense it's very fun!,"I'm not into the Multiverse arc as when writers go down that route it means they can't think of anything creative or original within the confines of our own universe (which is already quite limitless).So we get the Multiverse arc, with the usual doppelgängers of familiar characters in their copy-Earths. It all feels quite small, to be honest. We don't even get an original villain or particularly interesting new characters/species/worlds. Certainly nothing with any depth.The plot is total nonsense. The motivations of the villain and the deus ex machinas are so blatantly contrived. Yet.......yet despite these significant issues the movie-experience succeeds in being entertaining & fun. It's a horror-lite action piece, like if Evil Dead had a PG-certificate. I wish the producers allowed an actual 18-rated fantasy-horror, or at least 15. The PG-rated stuff we do get however is very well made, there's a bunch of fantastic imagery, exciting pacing, and Liz Olsen - despite her character's questionable motivations, and physically petite frame - manages a magnetic threatening screen presence. Very stylish rather than scary, mind. Shades of Terminator, Apocalypse from X-Men, and even Carrie through to Ultimecia, combine to make a memorable villain. A shame that the plot-resolution is a cheap unimaginative comedown after all that build-up.Also fine work from the rest of the cast. They all manage to sell us this frankly ridiculous story.Despite the 8/10, it does feel like the MCU quality is on an inconsistent downward trend from the strong stuff we got in Phases 2 & 3. From Phase 4 I've only watched Shang-Chi (good) & Spider-Man 3 (meh) so far. Not bothering with any more Marvel except Guardians 3. It's been a mostly fun ride since starting with Iron Man 1 back in November, and has been rewarded with a very rare 10/10 in Infinity War. So overall the Infinity Saga is well worth watching in full. The Multiverse Saga? Not really feeling it. And judging by reviews very few of these movies are worth checking out as standalones. Doctor Strange 2 however is highly-recommended for fans of the first one, tho' turn brain off to enjoy more :)Let's see if Guardians 3 will be a quality farewell to the Marvel universe(s).",1,0,slowcando,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur59092557/?ref_=tturv_usr_325_t,4-Jan-24,8,/10,
https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8296865/?ref_=tturv_perm_326,This Film Makes Me Mad,"With a title like Multiverse of Madness you go in expecting, well, a Multiverse of Madness. What you will find is a bland mess of a film, the visuals are neat and the direction is possibly up there as some of the best in the MCU but the characters are hollow shells which do nothing except move the film along. The multiverses we'll be travelling to are the INSANE New York with greenery and the EVEN CRAZIER New York but it's somehow even greyer than it usually is. Unless you count a couple seconds showing actually interesting universes this is all of the multiverse we'll be seeing.Don't worry though, we have these great characters to take us through the story. I can't wait for Doctor lady who turned up for all of 5 minutes in the first film to be revealed as actually important for some reason. Doctor Strange lacks any real character, he sort of develops but it's very small and doesn't amount to much. America Chavez is here. She's a character. I mean it, she steps on the magic exposition dump pavement so we can see her tragic backstory get televised to the world in a shop window. Neat how that worked out and suddenly I care about this girl who hardly has anything to do apart from move the plot along.The CGI is pretty bad at points, likely due to the fact they have to rush these films out so that everything fits together. I don't like the forced cameos. Really this film over promised and under achieved. Also the villain reveal is so obvious and the motivations just aren't immediately clear unless you have a decent knowledge of multiple other properties and bits of lore.The maddest thing about this film is that, even with all this said, I still enjoyed it and I'm going to continue watching every one of these movies until I die or the MCU does.

As many have pointed out, this was really a WandaVision sequel and I really didn't like where they went with it. I imagine the intention was complexity, but it just descended into silliness.The biggest problem is the sheer escalation of every round. First it's saving the city, then the country, then the planet, then saving the universe and now we're into multiverses. They might think they're being clever, opening up the possibility of endless reviving of characters and plots, but it all becomes rather meaningless after a while, since it diminishes the importance of each individual and universe - there are so many others out there!The upshot is that I am no longer enthused about a prospective Marvel release and couldn't care less if there was never another Spider Man, Batman or even Superman movie. That doesn't mean I cannot be won over - WandaVision was excellent and I enjoyed Hawkeye, but the characters have to be appealing and the plots well structured and intelligent (without having to be complicated - the audience is there to be entertained, not baffled).",2,1,blrnani,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur60516395/?ref_=tturv_usr_333_t,4-Jul-22,6,/10,

This would be great if they just called this ""The Scarlett Witch's Multiverse of Madness"" and it would have been fine. The way this film is written it's 35% about Doctor Strange and 65% about Wanda.This would have been better as a Disney series. Broken up into episodes. As a movie it's like sipping flat soda. It has all the flair but it's substance isn't there. This is a beautiful movie with great special effects but the plot is uninteresting. It stars a character (America) that you have no reason to care about (she's a minor comic book character) and Dr. Strange (who you came to see but it's not about him) and Wanda Maximoff (who finally reveals how powerful she is all too late since this is post Thanos) who has the most ridiculous plot device to let her powers emerge.This whole movie to me was just based around a bad plot. It would have been so much better if she was trying to revive Vision or find the Yellow powerstone in another universe to recreate him but that's not it.

Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness is a slightly disappointing film to feature a title and story concept that illustrates how vast and crazy the universe is that in fact does not match what is in the movie. By presenting the title ""Multiverse of Madness"", not many universes are discussed and explained to the fullest. There are only two universes that are the main points of this film. The rest is just a fleeting view of the universe.Apart from this, this film also feels lacking in terms of story plot. Instead of presenting a different universe story with the enemies faced, it will also be much stronger, in fact, this film focuses too much on Wanda or Scarlet Witch as the main enemy. Conflict is built on Wanda's personal problems who feel sad about the loss of a loved one (if you follow the WandaVision series, of course, you know). Therefore, the main focus that led to Wanda's conflict became a boomerang for this film to be able to explore the concept of the universe that she wanted to present.Overall, I'm satisfied with the film despite the many flaws in it. The presence of America Chavez's character is a refresher and a regeneration event to feature young members of the Avengers. Likewise, featuring the Illuminati group in this film adds its own charm. Moreover, the cast for the Illuminati members is the most anticipated cast by fans, such as John Krasinki and Sir Patrick Stewart. Charlize Theron, who also enlivens at the end of the film, becomes an unexpected part.Just like the previous film, the second film from Doctor Strange still gives a good and beautiful visual appearance. Directed by Sam Raimi, this film does not present a much better and cooler visual appearance a la Sam Raimi. In addition to the visual appearance, the shooting technique of this film is also commendable. Sam Raimi really gives his trademark into this film.",2,2,HafizhMaulana21,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur158897541/?ref_=tturv_usr_339_t,1-Dec-22,8,/10,

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8122776/?ref_=tturv_perm_341,Raimi brings some horror and style to the MCU in this entertaining yet flawed entry,"""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness"" may not have been exactly what I was expecting, but it's a movie that I liked a lot and has grown on me the more I think about it! While I think it's a small step below the original, it's a great and most importantly entertaining film! However, while there is so much I really did love about the movie it isn't perfect, nor is it the home run for Marvel that I hoped it would be. That being said, it really is a fantastic Strange and Wanda story with some fun multiverse action! I was enthralled and entertained throughout the entire runtime, and I love the touches of horror that we got! There's so much to unpack here, so many things I liked and some that I didn't, which makes this movie a whole lot to process - in a good way!One of my absolute favourite parts of this movie is Wanda, the Scarlet Witch. I have wanted to see her go full evil for awhile, and let me just say this movie delivered on that! It continues her emotional arc from WandaVision perfectly in my opinion, and adapted stories from the comics in really interesting ways. While I loved how villainous and terrifying she could be, I liked that there was a tragic side to this, seeing how utterly destroyed by her emotions she had become, and this made it easy to sympathize with her. Her emotional arc in the MCU is one of my favourite and I can't wait to see where it goes next! Her powers were also such a thrill, she was very overpowered, but it made it all the more fun (especially in a certain scene near the midpoint of the film). I will admit there were a few missed opportunities and it didn't perfectly line up with her development in ""WandaVision"", but I was so happy we got to see this version of Wanda. It also worked so well because of Elizabeth Olsen's stunning performance- she truly stole the show. As much as I loved Benedict Cumberbatch coming back as Strange (and he was fantastic too- so good I don't even need to talk about it because it should be expected), Elizabeth Olsen really poured her soul into this performance just as she did in ""WandaVision"". Much like Oscar Isaac's performance in ""Moon Knight"", Olsen's performance here has become one of my personal favourites in all of the MCU.Now, that brings me to one of my issues. As much as I loved Wanda here, it really took away from the movie feeling like a Doctor Strange focused film, as he only had half the screen time and had to share with Wanda. While I loved this pairing, I wish this was a standalone ""Multiverse of Madness"" film instead of a sequel in Strange's trilogy. I say this because the writing clearly focused more on Wanda over Strange, her character arc was way more polished, contrasted with Strange's which was seemingly nonexistent, and forgot some of his development from ""Infinity War""/""Endgame"". It continued his story nicely and was fun, but it just didn't feel like it was as much of a ""Doctor Strange"" film as it should have been. The introduction to America Chavez was also quite nice, I love the character, but unfortunately she was used as a human plot device (but they did a decent job of it), and took important screen time away from Strange and Wanda.The writing here is easily the biggest issue I have with the film, which surprises me as the screenplay was penned by Michael Waldron who wrote ""Loki"", one of my favourite of the MCU shows. He did a fine job here, but the script is simply flawed. While it set up the lore and rules of the multiverse pretty well, it felt rushed and had very awkward pacing and dialogue. It wasn't the tightest script at all, could've easily used another draft, and even seemed shallow at times, with some pretty lacklustre character drama. The movie also felt like it was missing something; and that something was heart. It just didn't have a soul to it, and barely had any emotional value, it merely showed the story and that was that. Sure it was fun, but it lacked the impact that films like ""Infinity War"" really had. The first act was very clunky and it wasn't until about 30 minutes in that the movie really found its groove. The story was actually pretty simple when you boil it down, and didn't have as much to it as I would have liked it to. There were definitely some big missed opportunities, but on the flip side I loved how the script really embraced the weirdness of the Doctor Strange comics and brought in a lot of cool elements we haven't seen before. I also liked the contrast between Strange and Wanda, Wanda focusing on emotion over logic, while Strange has extreme emotional detachment and relies on logic alone, I just wish the movie focused on this more. The film did feel disjointed at times too, and honestly it didn't always work, but when it did, it was truly awesome. As much as I bashed a lot of Michael Waldron's work here, I still think he did a good job and thoroughly enjoyed everything his screenplay had to offer, it just had a few flaws. I would definitely love to see him do more with Marvel as long as he continues growing as a writer. (And I love that he got a cameo!)This film felt very different from the rest of Marvel, as much as I love the ""Marvel formula"" I love it when they try something new even if it doesn't work perfectly. This movie started off feeling pretty generic, and slowly became more and more Sam Raimi's film in the back half. Sam Raimi is easily this film's greatest strength, and I loved the breath of fresh air his style brought to the MCU. I was really surprised to see we got more of the ""Evil Dead"" and ""Drag Me to Hell"" Raimi over the ""Spider-Man"" Raimi, but getting those moments of horror sprinkled throughout was really fun! It's very distinctly a Raimi film, he nailed it with the style and horror, and really pushed the boundaries of what you can show in a PG movie! It was great, I had so much fun with the horror elements, this is the closest we'll ever get to an MCU horror film. The movie is quite bloody and brutal at times, had a lot of gore and even some jump scares! I couldn't get enough of it! It had Raimi's campy, creepy and especially groovy DNA all over it! There were some scenes that felt out of place or a little weird, but I liked the creativity of it. I also felt there were times (especially with Illuminati) where directors like the Russo brothers may have handled the action and large set pieces a little better, as a lot of the action scenes felt like they were over before they even began. But for the horror stuff alone, I'm so glad Raimi got to direct this, it had some truly horrific moments! I even loved the nod to ""Evil Dead 2"" with the Bruce Campbell cameo!This movie works so well despite its flaws because of Raimi's style. He radiates energy and enthusiasm as ever, truly saving this movie from itself and building it into something so unique and distinct. His instantly recognizable touch is present through and through, even surpassing the usual limitations of the MCU. From snap zooms to circle wipes to shaky cam in first person POV, he pulls out all the old tricks while fully realizing the untapped potential of Doctor Strange to further expand his visual arsenal. The visuals here are fantastic! I even loved how on top of his usual stylistic choices, he added in some canted angles and dolly shots that felt right out of a horror film! His aesthetic choices were very Raimi-esque and I liked the look of the film a lot, and on top of his circle wipes I also loved the way he used match cuts in sequences cutting between universes. The CGI was fantastic and this is one of the only movies since the last ""Doctor Strange"" that I genuinely think used 3D well! My only issue was that it did lack some of the trippy, Escher-like visuals from the first film, it wasn't as visually interesting in that sense.One of my other issues was with Danny Elfman's score. I am a sucker for good musical continuity- something this film barely had. Elfman completely threw out Michael Giacchino's themes for the character which have been used in the MCU numerous times since the first film, and this really upset me. I miss the harpsichord based instrumentation, and while we got a few seconds of the Strange theme here and there, it was largely missing from the film. The soundtrack was okay otherwise, my favourite new part about it was the theme Elfman composed for Wong. There's also a music battle in the film, which was quite strange and caught me off guard, but somehow worked in a weird way because of the score for that scene.The trailers definitely gave away too much of this movie, and fans speculated way too much. Going into the film I had very different expectations because of all that, but I was glad to see that the movie was different from what I expected. I admit I am a little disappointed in the simplicity of the plot, and that there were a few missed opportunities; this wasn't the slam dunk I had hoped this would be, but I still really liked this movie! It had some things I've been wanting to see for a while that made me very happy! It's not a cameo-palooza, but I was extremely happy with how the few cameos we got were treated! The film is flawed, and could've used 15 to 20 more minutes to add in some more breathing room as it moves at a breakneck pace and felt rushed at times, and could've gone a little more crazy with the multiverse, but what we got is still pretty good! The movie is an extremely entertaining time at the movies, its a solid new entry into the MCU with such a fresh feel, some great acting and distinctive directing. While it has issues, it is very satisfying and a joy to behold. And as an added bonus... it seems like Feige might be planting the seeds to start setting up a ""Secret Wars"" arc for the MCU! So, this movie may not be as good as the first ""Doctor Strange"", but I thoroughly enjoyed this new chapter and of the MCU, as well as the horrific tone it took on!",1,2,parksiet,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur73501762/?ref_=tturv_usr_341_t,7-May-22,8,/10,

I was surprised in seeing how many people actually disliked the movie. I get that people have different likings but if you hated the movie because it did not give you an absurd amount of cameos then you shouldn't have overhyped it. I will avoid making spoilers but we got 7 cameos in the movie: 1 in the post credit, 3 normal ones during the movie and 3 massive ones that made canon to the MCU 3 different groups. This is enough cameos for one movie. As for the movie itself I was glued to my seat the whole time, from beginning to end. I would have prefered the original cut of the movie but Marvel needed to reshoot things in order to be able to let kids watch the movie. Same treatment both Morbius and Venom got. Nontheless the movie was able to be dark and violent (if you've seen the movie you know I'm talking about one scene in particular). Another thing I see people complain about were the mothers of America Chavez. I do not care if you dislike LGBT or what, you do you, but hating a movie for a 30 seconds scene it's absurd. I almost forgot,you don't need to see Wandavision before this movie. You will understand things even if you haven't seen it but watching it would make things more clear about Scarlet Witch motivations. On the last note I really liked the music in this movie and loved how you got to see it tie togheter to the visual in some scenes.So that was my review, feel free to like it or dislike it, your choice.",26,37,ITALUKE,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur83793226/?ref_=tturv_usr_345_t,6-May-22,7,/10,

The script buckles under its weight serving different masters being a Doctor Strange sequel, a WandaVision sequel, a Sam Raimi film, and another chapter of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.First off, Michael Waldron's script took me by surprise. The trailers lead me to think the story was about something else than what we got, which was oddly smaller in scope than I expected.Like The Big Bang progressing to the theorized inevitable Big Crunch, the weight of the ever-expanding Marvel Universe is starting to cave in at the expense of the story, especially with the inclusion of a multiverse. These movies are starting to feel like weekly visits to the comic book store and reading a serial story with no end. I'm wary about that as that was why I stopped reading comic books serially in the first place and switched to graphic novels.Benedict Cumberbatch is a captivating actor and has made the Stephen Strange character his own, steering away from similarities to Tony Stark. Elizabeth Olson gives her best performance yet as Wanda Maximoff. The script gives her lots to play and she has the most range out of the cast.Sam Raimi's trademark B-movie horror movie elements are a breath of fresh air and fun. There are moments of terror and distress that parents should be aware of before taking children below the age of ten. When the horror sets in, it is treated like a contractually obligated time slot for Sam Raimi to take his turn and contribute his portion, as if the studio was saying, ""We did our bit, Sam. Now it's your turn. Go!""The first Doctor Strange was one of my favorite MCU solo films with the best cast full of character actors, trippy visuals, and firmly established an arc for Benedict Cumberbatch's Doctor Strange to grow in his next solo outing.Although these story elements are rightfully in place, The Multiverse of Madness does not pick up where the first movie left off satisfyingly. I wanted a deeper exploration of Doctor Strange as a character. What we got, the ""Are you happy, Doctor Strange?"", was telegraphed and unearned. This felt more of a sequel to Doctor Strange after the events of Infinity War and Spider-Man: No Way Home. I ultimately didn't feel the story was as emotionally compelling as the first Doctor Strange and it loses that initial earnestness, despite all its fun action sequences.",5,3,ObsessiveCinemaDisorder,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur77520024/?ref_=tturv_usr_347_t,14-May-22,6,/10,

The title drops another clue that we might be in store for a Cthulhu or two, certainly a movie rife with Sam Raimi's personal love-touches which are sure to include that crafty Bruce Campbell.Some have suggested this Doctor Strange is a full-service fan-job, yet the darkness of the horror is playful and the names of the characters or their origins are irrelevant to this tale, just as it would not matter what Cthulhu's house looks like or what Cthulhu does in its leisure time. The core question within all of the versions of ourselves is whether we have lived our lives with proper gusto and thus moved the cosmic needle. If so, we then ask what that means, blow up some buildings, insert a denouement, wipe the smudges off our 3-D glasses, and rebuild back better based on Lessons Learned.Thankfully, there is left open the distinct possibility that there exists some version of a Spider-Man with the ability to shoot webs from his (or her or its or their) butt(s).",4,4,justinwfirestone,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur61431381/?ref_=tturv_usr_363_t,18-May-22,8,/10,
https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8127526/?ref_=tturv_perm_364,Phenomenal visuals but flawed plot,"After a rough two years following the pandemic in which the MCU had almost only misses, Dr. Strange 2 is one of the few exceptions. It's not one of the strongest, but its entertainment value is there. This is true mostly thanks to Sam Raimi who gave an excellent performance behind the camera and of the creative team. The visuals, the various worlds, the imaginary and the camera movements are all inspired and the final segment is a total madness such that I think some scenes will become iconic. On the other side however, the plot is very weak. At least there is an overall sense and so the great visuals are not wasted, but if we look closer a lot of problem come to the surface. Also the whole premise of the movie, the villan and its motivations are kind of a nonsense because they could have been solved right at the start of the movie. And so if I have to do an average I'd say that Dr. Strange 2 is an ok movie, that is able to entertain for all of its duration and that is a fresh new entry for the MCU with a particular style, but the issues of the plot prevent it to go from a fun watch to an incredible experience.

Welcome back and to the long-awaited review for Dr. Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. You've got it this weekend Dr. Strange 2 was finally released and MCU fans can finally let a sigh of relief taht the MCU Phases are still coming hot and fresh and all new tricks.My biggest issue with the movie is that it glosses over the connection to No Way Home. It felt as if that was no significant or consequential time in the MCU. I mean Dr. Strange is pompous and flippant but it felt sooooooo ... idk. And quite early in the movie he makes a decision that just seems so careless and devil may care attitude. It felt a bit weird. Other than that I felt the movie moved a bit too fast but I do appreciate the under 2 hour runtime. Under two hours and it felt like things were just moving so quickly. Almost feels like you missed something and have to see it again. Quite refreshing i must admit and I do plan on seeing this again in short order. But let's get to the good.The movie is wild. The qualify this as madness and it was but it was even more so murderous. I mean from the trailer you can see how everything is literally unraveling on the screen, but the full movie takes it up a notch. The thing I'm most pleased by is that the trailer seems to show so much but the movie has so much more left in the tank. I was quite frightened this was just going to be What If come to live action. And while this movie definitely, touches What if tones, they are not derivative. I should've had more faith in Sam Raimi, Disney and Kevin Feige that they wouldn't let us down. On top of that, the cast doesn't let us down either. Benedict is all over and manages to keep his head straight. Elizabeth Olsen continues her great performance from WandaVision and really doubles down on the mad in this one. The newcomer who plays America Gomez, doesn't add much but let's see what we get from her character in the future. And all of the extra cast play their roles to a T. Was it all perfect? No. The directors or editors might have missed or should've used other takes but interestingly enough that makes me want to see the deleted scenes from this movie. They definitely whittled this movie down to be what it was which makes me think what crazy things didn't make the cut.All in all, I couldn't imagine seeing Dr. Strange in the Multiverse of Madness not on a big screen. The MCU put a ton of money, effort, and thought into the effects, cast, fanfare, etc. For this movie. Is it perfect? No. Will you be severely entertained and possibly grossed out or scared? Yes. You're left thinking how and when does this fit io the bigger universe and what's next! Grab a big box of popcorn and chow down as you enjoy this mad dash through the multiverse and MCU.",0,2,Stream2BigScreen_Movie_Reviews,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur14280854/?ref_=tturv_usr_372_t,7-May-22,8,/10,

I'm honestly surprised it hasn't got a higher age limit. But it's great with darker content. Marvel has for a long time felt too childish but this feels more real and got a stronger effect.The multiverse is a very confusing subject and it can ruin movies, but it can also make them more fun. This movie did a good job not making it too confusing while also utilizing it and creating fun fanservice.Like the previous Doctor Strange movie, the visual effects are spectacular and breathtaking. There are some scenes which are not quite as believable but it doesn't take the viewer out of the movie.The problem with these powerful magic characters is that they are too overpowered. There's a lot of plot armor, but it's almost impossible to avoid when you're playing with these powerful heroes.

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8317886/?ref_=tturv_perm_382,"""Ditsy Mom"" instead of D.S.I.T.M.O.M. is more accurate.","I'll start out with the good, which is the film has wonderful actors, the special effects are truly fantastic & well that is about all the good their is.So I give 1 star for the actors ( yes they were very well paid & fortunately they have mostly proved their full potential in other acting rolls, so all the actors should be able to move on from this truly dreadful experience ).The 2nd star is for the fantastic special effects ( as the special effects in the film were truly amazing as the people involved in that deserve credit ).The actual film is unbelievably badly directed & the script was terrible.That is why I can't give any more stars as this was such a terrible film.Sam Raimi is not a good director & should never have directed this film.Sam Raimi became famous for making the low budget film ""The Evil Dead"" (1981) which is good for him as some people liked it as a cheaply made film that was different at the time, but ultimately a good director it doesn't make him ( as he just did something different & it had a cult following ).Everything else he has directed which people have seen has not been that great as the best he did was with Spider-Man 1, 2 & 3 ( 2002 to 2007 ) or the Tobey Maguire one's if you like ( which were OK films but no.3 in that series really showed how Sam Raimi really was not up to the job as he was not able to fix the script problems no.3 had, so how the hell did he get given a reported $200m to make Marvel movie ( as he just doesn't get it ).The director's job is to make sure the script, the acting & how the movie flows all works in harmony & keeps the audience in a suspension of disbelief that they can enjoy ( as the audience should think yes these unlikely scenarios could logically lead from one to another & then with that the director has done his/her job & the audience can really enjoy the movie ).Sam Raimi does not have this ability as he is simply a bad director.( I have nothing against him as a person, but he is not up the job! )Because Sam Raimi has no idea how make a film script flow obviously as the scenes in this film make no sense going from one to another & the audience ask themselves why is this so bad, ultimately this now kills the Marvel series as the first Dr Strange movie was good but this 2nd one is ever so awful.Now with a bad director in charge the terrible script got through ( a decent director would have made the script be fixed first or refuse this movie ), so now we also have to look at the writer Michael Waldron as the script made no logical sense & people's motivations in the film were so unbelievable that it was impossible for an audience to be able to accept what was happening, as why was this writer given this $200m Marvel film?Michael Waldron was a writer for ""Rick and Morty"" ( from 2019 which is 6 years after it first was aired ) so basically he wrote for a cult TV show 6 years after other writers had built an audience & this somehow qualifies him as a writer for one of the most important films being released in 2022?( who is responsible for letting this bad writer ruin a Marvel franchise? )
Again I have nothing personal against the writer, it is just he is not good.So you have an incompetent director ( who made one low budget film that was OK in 1981 & a writer who really has not proved anything ) & the film is an absolute disaster as the story is ridiculous because each of the main characters motivations make no sense & the story ( the heart of all films ) becomes totally broken 💔 & you are left not wanting to see any more.The Eternals (2021) I gave 5 out of 10 was the start of the end of Marvel films ( being a must see as I won't buy that rubbish ) but this D. S. I. T. M. O. M. Or ""Ditsy Mom"" which is probably a more accurate title is the very END.I'm definitely checking out who the director & writers are before I watch another Marvel film & if they have the reputations of a Sam Raimi & a Michael Waldron then there is no way I'm risking paying to go see it.If ""Ditsy Mom"" was a DC comics film it would still be rated the worst one which is really saying something as there have been a few bad DC ones.My Marvel collection will not be including this truly dreadful movie in it, as I can't see how Marvel can recover long term from this as it has killed it!( I'm going to think of Guardians of the Galaxy 3 as a separate thing as James Gunn is an awesome director who understands what needs to be in a film - a true film maker who understands how films should work + flow )
Now if a director like James Gunn is in charge then you know you should get quality, as that is why these big budget films need proven directorial talent as if you can't just give it to someone who made an OK cheap movie back in 1981 & then expect it will be a success especially after seeing Spider-Man 3 as that was the film that proved he had no clue but the due diligence on this appointment was obviously not done & in turn we got an awful writer.I've included no actual spoilers of the film as the director & writer have spoiled the whole film anyway & most likely have killed the franchise themselves too ( as now people will have lost faith in Marvel films ), as the title Ditsy Mom I gave this film will be quickly self explanatory if you choose to see how bad it is ( as not the actors fault as they did exactly what the director & script told them to do, as I do feel sorry for them in all of this ).",1,1,Web_Of_Doom,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur119169565/?ref_=tturv_usr_382_t,9-Jul-22,2,/10,

Derrickson knew what was coming and wisely jumped the ship.We are left with this stitched-up atrocity of half-finished scripts whose primary goal at the end was to come up with cool scenes for Sam Raimi to direct and put his doodle on after half an hour of exposition. Yeah, I remember the mirrors, POV shots, tilts, and close-ups. Do you not realize this means nothing without an actual tone that you didn't allow him to input? I'm sorry, but if you actually think jump scares with Wanda are the essence of Raimi's direction, I've got bad news for you. On the other hand, this is a preview of what Edgar Wright's Ant Man would have looked like if he bit the bullet and stayed. Three montages and dolly zooms. Real auteur stuff.One saving grace was that Waldron didn't really care about characters beyond giving everyone some vague platitudes about ""the loss."" Which just feels schizophrenic when applied to Wanda. It was amusing to read that they actually intended for her to feel sympathetic, despite making her out to be a Jason Voorhees, dead set on hunting that one horny teenager. That was the highlight of the movie, with everything going downhill from there. Aside from that, the soundtrack was delightful; slaves from VFX mines coded some daring shots, or so it seems until you register the fact that the flight through the portals in the beginning was the promised madness but beyond that, just a standard ""slightly alien"" MCU backdrop.",0,1,tonosov-51238,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur66501971/?ref_=tturv_usr_387_t,5-Nov-23,5,/10,

I am through and through a horror fan, so it was great to see marvel finally stepping out of their comfort zone and trying something new. In my opinion the horror elements of this film were not scary, but they were done well. As someone who loves horror the toned down version that they did isn't scary to me, but two friends that I saw the film with are not horror fans so to them it was scary. This is of course thanks to Sam Raimis amazing direction, he came into this film late but was able to create an immersive experience and add in his horror talent, which create a fun film.Elizabeth Olsen is phenomenal as Scarlett Witch. This is easily her best performance and I highly suggest you watch WandaVision before this.Benedict Cumberbatch also gives his best Doctor Strange performance to date. I've been wanting more Strange for a while and what they gave us in ""No Way Home"" just wasn't enough for me, but this filled the want very nicely.The new character America Chavez played by Xochitl Gomez was cool. She was interesting and Gomez gave a solid performance.Now gripe time. First and foremost this movie is very rushed, and it is very easy to tell that they had cut some things that I think should have been left in there. The first 35-40 minutes felt like I watched a full movie, they went very quickly through the setup and it didn't work that well. My second gripe contains a spoiler, so all I will say is something happens at the end that is very corny. Lastly some of the CGI was rough, not a lot of it but there were a couple of noticeable moments that weren't done well.Overall I throughly enjoyed this film, it gave us some fun multiverse moments mixed with the incredible Sam Raimi direction.7.5/10.",1,5,bradykitchen-33648,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur125900670/?ref_=tturv_usr_389_t,7-May-22,7,/10,

Raimi is able to perfectly balance levity, action, character moments and even suspense and a bit of his trademark horror.However, even Kubrick level direction couldn't have fixed this absolute mess of a script.The plot has characters behaving completely out of character, forces character to act stupidly for the next plot point to happen and worst of all, is almost completely reliant on prior knowledge of the Wandavision TV show. Not having seen that, Scarlet Witch's motivation is entirely illogical, not to mention her turn from hero to genocidal maniac is completely out of character who someone who helped save the universe from Thanos.The MCU has turned into a giant, unfocused mess, where nostalgia, cross-promotion, marketing or woke identity politics nonsense take precedence over narrative coherence. While unlike the most recent plot driven Marvel movies Dr. Strange 2 is actually mostly charcter driven, it suffers from the same flaw as all recent Marvel films: character driven dialogue scenes are almost always cut short by someone yelling ""enough talking"", before the movie grinds to a halt for a nauseating 15 minute scene of cartoon physics and adobe after effects plugin energy beams.The central conflict of this film may have been the worst case yet. The entire reason for the confrontation with thousands killed could have been avoided with one simple sentence ""No Wanda, you kill the girl to take her power, but we will find a universe in which you children are orphaned, and take you there."" Or maybe even add a twist that in one of these universes Wanda is evil and must be stopped. Or start the movie with Wanda heading to a universe in which she foresees the Wanda of that universe will be killed, and initially try to rescue her, only for Wanda herself to be revealed as the killer from the vision.There could have been hundreds of ways to give her a better motivation that was not relaint on friends being unable to talk sense into each other.That really is the core problem with these Marvel movies. Supposedly intelligent characters are unable to communicate simple ideas to each other and end up fighting. The same happens with Strange and the Illuminati.The writers sacrifice character and narrative for spectacle, and it's a darm shame, because comic book movies have shown that they can be intelligent, character driven stories that still entertain. But even the spectacle is underwehlming. Maybe I've been spoiled by the recent Batman or Dune movies, but the Marvel movies feel increadibly cheap. From digital chromatic abberation to directional blur and various energy blast and particle flow plugins, effects in MCU films often look like envato presets. Even the matting looks bad, like on the rooftop scene after the opening. The actors were clearly on a soundstage that was badly matted onto a digital backdrop of NY. If a production can't even be bothered to arrange for a drone shot of the actors on a roof in NY, you know there's something wrong.The acting is generally underwhelming here, except for Elizabeth Olsen steals every scene she is in. Imagine what she could do with a good script.Aside from her, the other standout performance is by... Bruce Campbell. Because of course it is. It's one of several little Evil Dead easter eggs. I really wish someone would give this guy some leading roles, because he just lights up the screen.",2,7,kuner-59029,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur59761418/?ref_=tturv_usr_390_t,27-May-22,4,/10,

I wasn't blown away yet was excited to some thrilling, suspenseful, edgy action from the movie Wanda The Multiverse of .... I meant Doctor Strange, The Multiverse of Madness.Let me tell you, a lot is going on; for those that haven't been paying attention to Marvel this past year, you may have missed out on some of the characters and the what if's that came true, no pun intended.No spoilers but Doctor Strange had the spotlight stolen from him by the Scarlet Witch and a new character introduced to us. That took away from the appeal of who we came to see.Additionally, the raw power displayed was beautifully executed. Unfortunately, Spider-Man No Way Home was a hard act to follow. Yet any other elements tied to Doctor Strange's arc weren't correctly managed and flat-out thrown at us at the very end. As I mentioned, I saw character development from other characters, which took the focus off of the main protagonist. As a fan of Marvel, it is really cool to see characters that were introduced to us from Disney Plus ( get your subscription, Disney should pay me for the promo). It takes away from the enjoyment in the sense of Doctor Strange being a phenomenal supporting character in other marvel films but couldn't shine bright in his own.Nevertheless, the action is beautiful and vibrant, dark and edgy... is this Marvel? There were some jump scares... I mean, who wouldn't be afraid of The Scarlet Witch. You're in for a couple of surprises, all of which I don't believe the film capitalized on. They flirted with the shocks, and the casual fan may have missed some of the reveals, especially introducing new characters.",2,2,Entertainmentsparadise,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur131752399/?ref_=tturv_usr_392_t,10-May-22,7,/10,

They low-key were awesome.A lot of insane visuals and it definitely would be an overwhelming movie for a lot of people (and not necessarily a bad way!).

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8158825/?ref_=tturv_perm_396,"7.6/10 - Please, Don't Let This Be The Last MCU Film When Some Artistic Freedom is Given","That's what I call surpassing expectations.Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is a film I don't really wanna give a plot summary to. The plot descriptions on Letterboxd and IMDb are misleading like Loki on an especially mischievous day. I don't wanna say anything more than, this film is better going into blind, more or less. I mean, if you watch this film you're probably a Marvel fan, so you have somebackground. That's good. You probably know that there's some multiverse thing going on, and that the Scarlet Witch plays an important role in the film. That's all you need plot-wise, nothing more.As you can probably tell by now, I had a great watching experience with this movie. There's something very, very delightful about feeling your expectations for a film of this sort being surpassed. I mean, I'm used to get from the MCU a somewhat fun film, lots of cringy one liners, forced dialogue and characters that are mostly flat or shallow. Just a capitalist effort to make as many people as possible enter the cinema and give their money to the big mouse, to Disney. But this? This one feels like an actual MOVIE, for god's sake. An actual freakin' movie.Let's start with the visual aspect, cause it's so much better than most of the MCU easily, and it might even be the best one direction-wise. At least, the one that has the highest highlights. It's not a Kubrick film or anything, but I didn't expect this film to have so many beautiful shots, interesting compositions, unusual angles (for an MCU film).Also, Sam Raimi has quite a background in directing horror films, and it's so delightfully evident in the aesthetic of this movie. Multiverse of Madness is probably the most brutal film in the MCU, which, by the way, was my first indication that something good is going on here. I won't give you the details, but let's say that once I've seen this eye thing going on I had such a big smile across my face. I think that the way Raimi uses the audio of the film to create and atmosphere is something that isn't done nearly as well in the rest of the MCU. The score is great, too - psychedelic at times, creepy, and yes, epic when needed. Most of the time it fits well to what's going on without trying to hard to sound like the most epic thing ever and by that ruining itself.The real heart of the film, though, is the characters. There are many interesting motifs about self-reflection, balancing emotion with sense and determinism, something that I don't think I can say about any other MCU movie. Strange and Wanda actually go through a process here, and their characters are psychologically explored more than most characters in the MCU. It's not only showing in the dialogue or the motifs, but the very compositions of many scenes (I first noticed it in the wedding scene) put the characters in front. Actual characters, with fears and drives and feelings. Man, it just feels so good to get some quality out of the MCU.I think that most of my problems with the film are pacing-related, since I find the pacing, especially on the first act, kinda chaotic and too fast. I mean, sure, it's still an MCU film, but I do think that stuff could've been better paced from time to time. Also, America is nothing more than a plot device, which is fine overall since I don't really think she's the focus here, but maybe a little more personality to her would've made my watching experience a little bit better.But still, I just came out of the cinema with a huge smile on my face. I said that after watching No Way Home and Wandavision too and I will say it again - I think that the MCU could be so much better if Marvel would actually be trying to create good stories and give directors some artistic freedom. This is a prime example of that in my eyes - a Marvel film that beyond being simply good and not as mechanical or product-like as No Way Home for instance, actually has a lot of the director's heart in it. Please, let this film not be the last Marvel movie to give some artistic freedom to directors.I'm feeling a 7.6/10 on this one. Don't let it be the last good MCU film.",3,2,Shilo_R_A,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur130729929/?ref_=tturv_usr_396_t,20-May-22,7,/10,

Visually, it's a blast at certain moments and it's a blast to watch. But that's where it kind of ended for me. The music was good, but nothing that made me sit my ass down. The action scenes were great too, but then again, there have been better ones in Marvel. It was the story that took the biggest hit. It's pretty weak in my opinion, and unfortunately this vice is starting to repeat itself. I first noticed this with Spider-Man: No Way Home, but it didn't matter in the finale, because it was all taken care of by a trio of our favorite Spider-Men who pulled the whole movie off, and besides, the action was on another level with better music. I actually noticed this earlier with Venom: Let There Be Carnage, where it just didn't quite work out. Then after a while came the failed Morbius and now this. Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness came out even better thanks to its aforementioned visuals, which made the film interesting. Otherwise, it would probably have been above average. It's a shame. I understand that they want to show us something grandiose in the form of effects at every corner, but we shouldn't forget about the quality of the plot, which I don't think is bad here, but definitely weaker compared to other Marvel movies. Historically, this has been done in Avengers: Infinity War, for example, where action and good looks were plentiful while not forgetting a good plot with a good story. Here, it went a bit to hell for me as far as the writing goes, and in my opinion, that's the biggest minus of the new Doctor Strange. For me, a good movie that I recommend more to just the bigger fans of the Marvel world. For the average viewer, I would only recommend this movie if they want some eye candy and aren't looking for a deeper plot.",0,1,Polotovar,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur135273424/?ref_=tturv_usr_398_t,7-May-22,7,/10,
https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8282027/?ref_=tturv_perm_399,Came Close to Going Off the Rails,"Overall, I enjoyed this movie. It was a nice departure from the other Marvel movies. I was never a fan of the Dr. Strange comics, but the first movie was pretty good and this one is good, too.My problem is there is so much going on and if you have not kept up with all the movies and TV shows, you might be lost if you just watched this movie alone. The special effects are awesome. But there are so many characters and plot lines running through this movie (as well as some of the TV shows for which it draws plot lines) that its really easy to get lost in it all. I'm not a fan of the multiverse plot, but so far it seems to be working. In a less masterful hand, this could have easily gone off the rails into a huge mess, but Raimi keeps up the pace and Cumberbatch is an outstanding actor so the movie manages to be chaotic, but not crazy.I really hate what they did with Wanda/Scarlet Witch. I love Elizabeth Olsen and I always thought her character was fantastic in the movies and the WandaVision show. I know her character turns evil in the comics, but it seems like such a waste of the character to have her turn evil.The cameos were a nice touch, but I think the movie would have been a bit tighter without them. Unless they plan on reusing these actors in ""our"" Marvel universe (also known as Earth 616), then they were extremely pointless.Overall, I found the movie entertaining and fun to watch. The actors are all at the top of their game and Raimi does a great job of keeping everything moving forward.",1,0,Eric266,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur23467935/?ref_=tturv_usr_399_t,28-Jun-22,7,/10,

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8121097/?ref_=tturv_perm_407,A multiverse of madness indeed. Sam Raimi is back and I relish the freedom he's been given in this movie.,"Sam Raimi, director of the three first Spider-Man movies, is back again on the superhero arena to craft the most barbarically crazy multiversal story thus far in the MCU.Very mild spoilers ahead(?)And as such, he delivers not only amazing action scenes with mesmerizing visuals and imaginative ""magic"" (something we don't quite see as often anymore); but also heartfelt and compelling characters and arcs that come full circle in one way or the other at the end.However, something might catch some by surprise, the aformentioned director is not only known by directing endearing and compelling character moments through amazing visuals, but he is also known by his passion and history in horror. A genre he understands well and makes use of to incite fear and some scares in all madness about. So expect horror movie elements sprinkled throughout the movie. Personally, I believe it works in the movie's favor given the particularly witchcraftian nature of both main characters.Nevertheless, the movie isn't exempt of some flaws. While these won't ruin your enjoyment of the film, for those seeking more out of it in terms of storytelling, script and filmmaking; unfortunately the movie has too much going on for its own good. And there are many sequence of exposition that right out explains artifacts, characters and even relationships. However, the movie knows this and the director tries to keep them light and direct through creative sequences. The movie is trying to do many things so it has problems slowing down to make the emotional moments hit harder. Nevertheless, if you like non-stop pacing in a movie you are in luck because here it's all over the place, there's always something happening to keep you invested and that makes the action and visuals thrust you into the next madness. But, as with any frantic pace, it has trouble breathing and taking a moment to take in what just happened.Other than that, the movie excells at entertainment and character development. Additionally, while the multiverse concept is present in the movie is not overplayed nor overused, so it allows for less confusion. Marvel fans will also find some interesting cameos, references and full on groundbreaking cameos that makes the movie a must see if you want to follow the MCU's unraveling stories to come....IN CONCLUSION, the movie is a fast-paced, non-stop visual and narrative trip into the world of magic and multiversal travel, the biggest one so far in the MCU. And thanks to the particular unique voice that Sam Raimi gives it, makes it stand out from the rest and a welcome edition to the crazy wizarding world of Doctor Strange and Marvel.",3,4,quiqueperezsoler,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur80500138/?ref_=tturv_usr_407_t,6-May-22,7,/10,

Waste of Cumberbatch's talent & incredulous $200 mil budget. He's NOT main character in his own film! It's more Wandavision- so THIS film should be named after her. I have NO interest in her character after her Avengers cameos.Shame on Marvel for changing THIS Dr Strange into ""The Walking Dead"" horror spin off. These paid Script writers have NO sense of cohesion among the MCU characters, never saw entire 1st film, & never read 1 comic book of this popular character. Horridly dull teen lead casting & acting incl cameos. Zero charisma among cast, esp Strange & Christine who made believable ""caring ex- couple"" in the first Dr. Strange film.Grand Plot: 1 Wanda in 1 universe wants to be with ""kids"" she has in another universe. That's it - for 2 hrs 40 min.Despite modern fertility methods or adoption esp of 10-12 age boys, that could easily make Wanda a mom, Wanda instead does EVERYTHING ELSE in this truly waste of time $$ Disney cash grab flop.MANY MAJOR CONS:
Tilda Swanson from 1st Dr Strange as ""Sorcerer Supreme"" had FAR more power than now Sorcerer Supreme Wong. In clear racial bias against Asians script, here Wong has skills of a novice mystic. Wong does not even possess same type of mystic daily clothing like Mordor who wore magical boots & used magic staff- ""objects pick you"" Mordor explained in 1st film.Predictable ""woke "" script, BAD overall writing;
Here, No one needs to see yet another ethnic hybrid TEEN GIRL with ZERO charisma, no acting talent, taking up most screen time, & has character dementia in script. She's Latino Aladdin in NY & other 69 universes is same useless boring dementia suffering ""pizza loving"" thief.THIS FILM is both teen (America) & Wanda's film. All acting is flat & one dimensional- zero character development, incl Strange.NO CONTINUITY RE PRIOR MCU CHARACTERS:
If Latino looking Scarlet Witch / Wanda is SO powerful, then why she didn't prevent Thanos from killing her beloved? Captain Marvel is supposedly the strongest of all heroes and female- more like a god since she can blast travel to other worlds without spacesuit. Here, Capt. Marvel's powers are omitted from all universes.This film makes Wanda / Scarlet Witch more powerful in every universe than ALL MCU characters COMBINED !! Also, Wanda has temples, worshipers, followers, monster guardians, etc., placed in many universes, but she FORGOT ALL mighty beings, temples, weapons, all at her command until she literally runs into them while chasing teen girl.Dr Strange follows same TEEN to 2 universes as protection. I fell asleep repeatedly bc other universes are that DULL incl script. Of course black women replace whites, so why not replace Prof X (P. Stewart) with Idris Elba who is Brit & good actor? Shazam is new Spock? Strange died fighting Thanos?How many Thanos infinity stones events occurred? Wasn't Thanos' life long purpose of time traveling ALL the universes to take 5 ""rare"" infinity stones, set them in custom glove, then ""reset ALL universes time to 1/4 population"" causing the 5 year blip? WTH with THIS film's plot & contradicting backstory??Can Marvel script writers have a conference call with previous writers, or at LEAST watch recent prior MCU movies with characters they're using in plot? Is anyone with common sense going to state the obvious irrationality and inconsistencies, esp DULLNESS viewers can easily see?Here, less powerful Dr Strange can inhabit his dead body double- so why couldn't godlike Wanda do same & ""be a Mom"" instead of sending her monstrous ""agents"" to 70 universes for YRS, causing constant chaos & many deaths, chasing same dementia girl. Also, nonsensical Wanda needs to imprison, steal teen's ""power"" via ""special ritual"" using ""dark power book"" as reserve ""universe jumper"" tool. Wanda has god powers- nothing else needed.POOR FOCUS ON FEMALES & BAD acting:
This LONG boring plot ""'Wanda wants to be a Mom"" when she already is plot prolongs this film , stretching it to convoluted boredom. Film focuses primarily on bad acting bad scripted female characters. Strange's ex Christine, looks odd in wrong red dyed wig & enlarged bust; despite Strange's everlasting love, she loathes Strange, Christine becomes both scientist & expert fighter in mystic antiquities with NO training in Kamertage Tibet. Christine suddenly knows how to kill demons from hell @ 1st encounter, but NOT Strange nor Supreme Being Wong? So female Christine is better than Strange = political message.Final big VIP CON: Racial BIAS against Asians of Mongloid ancestry CONTINUES:
Tibet is IN CHINA, mystic arts ""founded by Japanese sorcerer mighty Agamoto"" per 1st Dr Strange film. Why give mystic arts an Asian, not India, history if U fail to use Asian PPL? WHY are majority of sorcerers now black or Latino, NOT any of Mongloid descent? No Native Americans, nor blondes are sorcerers in this film's Tibet.In HOLLYWOOD films, Why no Asians actors with real lines ESPECIALLY in YRS of Disney's self proclaimed ""LEADER of wokeness?""Most VIP DISNEY: STOP DISRESPECTING real ASIAN AMERICANS in YEARS ""woke leadership"" role by REDUCING Asians to mere SET DECOR WITHOUT ANY lines. Westernized American Asians & THEIR $$ have SAME VALUE as other ethnicities.Give Wong well written script, notable screen time, & more POWER esp in battles as Supreme Sorcerer, like you gave female ""Celtic"" Tilda. Or replace him with a better Asian actor, NOT tasteless Akwafina. 1 push & Wong is knocked out while petite females can sustain long physical battles. Wong had no battle plan either nor main aides. Tilda fought off 3 young male sorcerers with only hand fans, & she had her R hand sorcerer black Mordor. None were Asian. 1 hand Korean master sorcerer remains MUTE in both Strange films.Tilda as ""Ancient One Sorcerer Supreme"", foresaw NIL re this teen girl jumping thru 70 multi universes thru YEARS, adversely affecting every world & timeline due to all deaths that followed her from Wanda. Tilda, with extra long life had ""multiverse connections & oversight"" that's echoed in new teen Spiderman franchise films. Yet, in THIS FILM Wong as ""supreme sorcerer"" has NO connections with multi verse despite him taking multi verse business trips in prior MCU films.HORROR effects: Hey MCU execs - make Guardians of the Galaxy into ""Walking Dead-"" It already has strange looking characters in franchise. Return Dr Strange to his original character & purpose- refining his ""science"" craft & visiting different worlds like Star Trek. Dr Strange is not a horror zombie, conjuring up demon souls, nor babysitter of random teen.What an incredible disappointment THIS sequel is to 1st Dr Strange!!!Sadly, Disney owned Marvel & other studios continue recent tradition to focus on political propaganda , continue same racial bias, instead of focusing on entertainment = creating good film, esp story, & casting good mature actors OF EVERY ETHNICITY- not few.Entertainment is primary reason ppl PAY to view films.

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8366039/?ref_=tturv_perm_411,Average with some entertaining parts,"I think I would rate this between a 6 and 7 out of 10. The movie follows Dr Strange and a new multiverse traveler as they try to stop Wanda/Scarlet Witch from controlling the multiverse. As everyone has seen from the movie trailer, Scarlet Witch has pretty much taken over Wanda and is the nemesis of the movie. The movie has its entertaining moments and is a pretty simple story to follow. But it also has some cringe worthy story lines throughout and some even more cringe worthy acting in parts. Of course the best parts include the different multiverse characters, but those moments are short lived. I was hoping there would be more Marvel Zombie action, but that turned out to be a huge disappointment with terrible CGI. It was almost laughable. Since the movie is free now on Disney+, it's worth a watch. But in the end, it's a one and done. Side note, you don't really have to watch the Wanda show on Disney first, but maybe read a recap of it because the reason this whole thing is happening is due to the end of that show.",1,2,heidibokor,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur114216935/?ref_=tturv_usr_411_t,24-Jul-22,7,/10,

They said that it would be the first horror movie of the MCU, that it would be a dark movie, and they shot a movie that was childish even compared to the MCU average.What is most serious and needs to be talked about is that a movie that should have a critical place in the larger MCU story continuity is completely irrelevant. The movie is about multiverses, the whole new phase of the mcu was about multiverses. Doctor Strange seemed to be one of the most critical and popular characters to be positioned at the center of the new phase. And they wrote a completely unrelated story arc. Even if the actor playing Khan did not put the final nail in the coffin, this was a move that was seriously damaging to the new phase.Regardless of all this, the scenario is simple and of poor quality. Another serious mistake is to say that you have made a very ambitious movie about multiverses, but then put in only one meaningful parallel universe and a few less visible parallel universes. With such a brand and budget, they had to feed us on parallel universes. The movie offers nothing in this regard other than a parallel universe adorned with excessive fanservice.During the script writing phase, it was clear that this film would be a huge failure, and there was no material that could be salvaged during the shooting phase.",1,1,averagedeveloper,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur139314041/?ref_=tturv_usr_412_t,17-Mar-24,3,/10,
https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8118852/?ref_=tturv_perm_413,Should be called Doctor Strange: into the madness,"The most BIZZARE MCU film ever madeMovie was fun, had Sam raimi written all over it, I feel like they gave him a lot of creative control on this film as well. I am appreciative to see Sam back in the game, I will say however this film I didn't love as much as I wanted to. Sometimes I would just feel the run time, and how the plot/story felt drawn out more than it should. There is nice action, but it can be a tad repetitive at times, nonetheless it's a joy ride. The villain is amazing and id say Carries the film in ways. There isn't as much multiverse meddling that the movie kind of claims it has in its title, sure they visit like 1 or 2 multiverse worlds but I feel like it's more madness going on in this film. Doctor strange was great and so was Wanda,Pros:Sam raimi creative controlVery bonkers moments that really feel crazy that the MCU even allowed raimi to do in the film and it is very appreciated whole heartedly!Wanda Maximoff !!!Doctor Strange story dynamicActors were pretty great,Cons:Plot/story couldn't care for or get behind much, once I kind of saw how it was shaping to be and the direction it was going I just couldn't care for it as muchMy reason for this I believe has to do with this I believe has to do with America Chavez I literally tried to feel some sort of attachment to her character but there's like nothing... she's basically the sole reason for the film, and there's like one scene she has with strange when they're standing on some platform that shows their memories... that's like the only moment I kind of latched onto her but it wasn't enough, sure they sprinkled more stuff into it but her performance, dialogue and purpose wasn't enough bread and butter to me compared to everyone else and I think is another reason why I couldn't get into the story/plot as muchTone seems fine but I feel like the film would have been better off being an R rated film, not a huge con and I think raimi balances it well, but I feel maybe this is another reason why I felt a little distant to the directionThere's a part in the film where scarlet witch does something in like 1,2,3 to a bunch of people who should have stopped her... but of course they didn't... which is fine... I don't have a problem with that, if she's really that powerful to take down (these people who will not be named) then I'll buy that... BUT when it comes to her doing what has to be done for the plot/story of the film... it feels as if the movie is just stalling that time for the sake of the Plot/story... like didn't you just do ABC??? Why can't you do XYZ??? Just doesn't make sense to me, then of course it builds enough time for the film to catch up to her when she clearly has the advantage and clearly is not holding back anymore.P. SI really do appreciate this film for the sole purpose that I feel the MCU really gave this creative control the Raimi and it had his name written all over it. You can tell it's his film from every shot... sure it felt maybe a tad scattered here and there but the moments that are supposed to deliver kind of do, even if it doesn't necessarily stick the landing, there are ALOT of moments in the film that will have your brain go ""the MCU allowed raimi to do this in the film??!!!!"" And when you see it you kind of just smile really hard especially when you know this guys film style.

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8274047/?ref_=tturv_perm_415,"Not much madness, verses or point","I have watched every Marvel film. Every Sony offshoot.There is much to struggle with here.The film, from a so so start, to a shrug of the shoulders end credit scenes (two of them)....all of it is just unmemorable.Heavy on background music to entice pathos, emotion etc. Danny Elfman can't be faulted....but that's all manufactured to make you feel something.And you don't. You don't care.The music is doing the heavy lifting when that job should have been done by the script.The whole adventure is silly (not madness), lacking in verses (three or four is hardly multi) and the not too overt metaphor for America.....literally the country.....which is embodied in the form of a teenage girl.Portals are opened. Doors are broken. A darkness takes hold and there is the book of vishanti (truth - vis-à-vis facts).It all smacks of a script written during Trump's mad rule of America.The dialogue has double meanings throughout. It all sounds just like a commentary on America and it's divisions.I thought the first Dr. Strange was ok but this can't seem to reach that bar.Lots of CGI wizz and bangs but none of it is very deep.It's like a follow up to Wandavision rather than Dr. Strange.Directed by Sam Raimi, it reminded me of the same feeling I had when I watched Spider-Man 3 (Tobey McGuire version), also directed by Sam.There's a lot of stuff in it....lots of everything....but nothing of substance. Just disappointing.It may have been a better film if they had delved more deeply into one of two aspects. But they don't.The film is less multiverse of madness and more multitude of meh.To see how to have fun with madness, watch Venom : Let there be carnage. Not a deep film but by God multiply more fun than this.If you're a Marvel fan, you'll watch this BUT lower your expectations (a lot) and you may enjoy it.TBF, the inclusion of some ""extra"" characters is enjoyable to see but it all looks like a set up for future Marvel movies.",1,3,mr_sharma,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur4803434/?ref_=tturv_usr_415_t,25-Jun-22,5,/10,

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8548202/?ref_=tturv_perm_417,Genuinely entertaining,"Even though I'm of the opinion that the MCU should've ended with Endgame, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is a genuinely entertaining movie that I enjoyed watching. It sure won't win any prizes, and even among its sister movies it will only be remembered as ""Oh, yeah, I forgot about that one; it wasn't bad!"", but, well, it wasn't bad.The movie suffers from the typical problems that MCU movies do: (1) it depends on far too many past entries to the series. If you haven't watched the previous Doctor Strange movie, you won't know who the main characters are; if you haven't watched Infinity War and Endgame, you won't understand the setting, if you haven't watched WandaVision, you won't understand Wanda's motivations; if you haven't watched the third MCU Spiderman movie, you won't understand the multiverse thing; and if you aren't at least aware of Marvel's old intellectual properties (X-Men and Fantastic Four) you won't be able to appreciate some of the ""Ohhh, cool!"" moments. Doing this was ambitious enough with the first Avengers movie, and only worked with Infinity War and Engame because Disney somehow managed to rope everyone into watching their stuff. By now it's become old hat and is a like a slowly crumbling overhang: prone to collapse but somehow still holding on.(2) There is no sense of scale. Captain America was a classical superhero, but doing that has become old hat, so Marvel needed to escalate. That worked for a while, until Captain Marvel's amazing prowess suddenly wasn't a match for seemingly weak opponents. Being the most powerful being in the universe wasn't enough, so suddenly we have the most powerful being in the multiverse. Doctor Strange is, except for his magical powers, a normal human being, yet he survives being slammed into a wall without injuries, but still gets hurt by being punched by some other guy.(3) The rules don't get explained, so the stakes don't matter. At the beginning, there's this awesome magical fight. But without knowing what the opponents really can do, it's basically just flashes of light and lots of destruction. I certainly wasn't sitting at the edge of my seat.(4) You know what's going to happen because it has to happen. No, the villain won't get defeated at the beginning of the movie; doing so would end the movie. No, the damsel in distress won't die at the beginning of the movie; doing so would end the movie. No, the hero won't be defeated at the climax; this isn't a two-parter so there has to be a happy ending.(5) The ultimate superpower is believing in yourself.(6) ""Your magnetic signature could be radiactive!"" That's not how magnetism works, or radioactivity. If you need to do technobabble, at least make it stand up to high school science classes. Besides, we all know that real technobabble involves quantum stuff.(7) The person-of-colour character has two Moms, look how diverse we are. Probably not in the Chinese edit, though, I guess? C'mon, Buffy the Vampire Slayer could do non-standard characters twenty years ago without it feeling patronising; you could at least try.(8) Oh, no, I don't know that funky new character who shows up in the mid-credit scene! And neither do I care at this point.All these issues are something that crops up in every new-ish Marvel movie, and I doubt that it will ever get fixed. Admittedly, Strange's mad multiverse was a bit more imaginative than the usual fare, and it was a fair bit darker (with some blood and an actual zombie rising from the grave, though still child friendly enough as to not frighten away the target audience). There were a few actually cool scenes, though not cool enough that I'll remember them next week. The acting was acted. The soundtrack was soundtrack. The direction was directed. The visual effects were... actually inconsistent? At times very pretty, at other times oddly uncanny. The best parts weren't anything we've never seen before, unfortunately.All in all, it's still an entertaining movie. I don't regret spending two hours on it, though I'm quite sure I won't ever watch it again. It's nothing more than empty entertainment, though; it certainly doesn't provide food for thought or provoke any deep questions. I wish Disney would try something ambitious for once, but I guess that might risk offending someone and thus reduce the profit margins.

I mean it is not a bad thing cause I love seeing other marvel characters in the solo movies, but then please adapt the movie title to it if the other marvel character gets more attention than the main character.Also on other thing and why I removed one from my ten stars is that I felt like I was missing something in the story and to better understand it I would have to watch the series Wandavision first which is a big no-go for me. You can not expect or force people to watch the series first on a certain streaming channel where you need a subscription with a monthly fee that I don't even wanna have in the first place, what the hell?

I won't spoil that cameo in detail. The other cameos are amazing so I won't spoil them as well. Sam Raimi did a good job directing this film. He directed the Spider-Man trilogy and it's no wonder that Marvel wanted him to come back and direct another superhero film. Danny Elfman's composing for this film is phenomenal.

I loved the action scenes and the non-stop insanity. But I quickly came to realisation that this movie lacks in something.Perhaps it lacks in characters. We see a total of 4 characters and some random ones who die the moment they step in front of Wanda. In addition to that, the movie lacks in... multiverses. Other worlds. I'd really love to see this movie with less action and more exploring.Another problem is that the villain is more likeable than the good guys. I love Wanda. She's by far the strongest of them all and still she has emotion and she can feel pain.Generally it is a good movie and it's worth watching especially in cinemas.

In Thor, the thunder god says 'Your Ancestors Called it Magic, but You Call it Science. I Come From a Land Where They Are One and the Same.' and that went through all the films, even the first Dr Strange. Kevin Feige talked a lot about how that was based on quantum physics, and they even had a university professor - Adam Frank - as scientific consultant. This film feels like it's destroyed all that for zombies and demons.Cumberbatchs Dr Strange is practically the last grown up Avenger left, and as such has big responsibilities to the world. Here he's trying to protect a young, um, powered - for all we know, the MCU may class her as a mutant, given they now they have access to those characters - being, who is being chased down by demons for her powers. And that is the problem with this film; we all know that mutants, Fantastic Four, Deadpool and all the other former Fox properties are coming, and the multiverse gives an in universe way to get them there. It's a pretty big issue having the Illuminati - Patrick Stewart, Hayley Atwell, Anson Mount, Lashana Lynch, John Krasinski - in the film, because they couldn't all be there together before. They're just not the main characters, and like every other MCU solo movie title, it's that titular character whose job it is to be the closer.As with every MCU film, the graphics are on the grand scale; from Kamar Taj to alien planets, to a montage of multiverse travel, it's all become expected.

I loved some of the visuals and designs employed in this film, particularly some of the magic and monsters. When the film focuses on this aspect it shines.There is a section of the film that could have been reworked or cut out. It has some unique visuals and characters, but it sort of clashed with the cat and mouse chase present within the rest of the film.

The director is the reason why I was most excited for this film (also the repurcussions of Strange & Wanda's actions). Raimi's touch is present throughout with jump scares & gore galore!Set after the events of #nowayhome, #DoctorStrange sets out to help #americachavez, a teenager from another universe, who is being hunted for her powers (ability to travel through the multiverse).Sequels in the MCU aren't self-contained anymore. We have characters from multiple movies crossing over. Even here, more than Strange, it is #wanda who steals the show/has more prominence. This isn't me ranting because I personally loved the ""trip"" across a plethora of universes that is peppered with cameos!My favourite part of this trippy sequel was Xochitl Gomez's America Chavez. It is not easy when you are beside Cumberbatch & Olsen but she stands tall! A #mcu series on her would be a great idea. Elizabeth Olsen continues to enchant us. Hers is currently the best arc in the MCU. Benedict Cumberbatch can't do anything wrong and his witty portrayal of the character is spot-on. Rachel McAdams, Benedict Wong, Chiwetel Ejiofor & Michael Stuhlbarg reprise their roles.Doctor Strange in the MoM's only fault lies in its duration. We as fans have come to expect longer movies from the MCU given the scale. Nevertheless, the MCU delivers yet again with Raimi at the helm.

Dr Stephen Strange casts a forbidden spell that opens a portal to the multiverse. However, a threat emerges that may be too big for his team to handle.With a pretty short runtime for a Marvel movie (2 hours and 5 minutes), Dr Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is a very fast paced and action packed movie. The fights are very good and intense all throughout and literally start as the movie begins. Marvel went all out with great visual effects and superb CGI which made the movie very visually appealing. This movie was directed by Sam Raimi, who also had directed the first three Spiderman movies before moving on to horror movies. His skills at creating the right visuals and jumpscares, which are the fruit of his long experience with horror movies, really shine through in this movie by successfully setting a tense mood to provoke viewers.The acting is truly amazing. Benedict Cumberabtch does a really good job portraying different versions of the same character which is generally challenging. But, the performance that really stands out is delivered by Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda. She is excellent in this movie doing exactly what she is supposed to do in the best way possible. Her character is very scary and intimidating especially with the make up and the amazing visuals I have already mentioned. It really felt more le a Wanda movie than a Dr. Strange one. However, I didn't quite like Xcohilt Gomez as America Chavez, as I didn't really feel the power she is supposed to have. I hope this will change in the upcoming movies because I feel like she is going to be a very important character in the MCU.As a big Marvel fan, I really loved the cameos in the movie (everyone in the theater was shocked by them and applauded for each), especially because I neither saw any spoilers nor read any theories prior to watching the movie.The movie is great and really entertaining. However, it doesn't include anything special. Concludingly, if you don't have high expectations before watching the movie, you would really enjoy it.Score:7.5/10.",0,1,wackoreviews,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur154909566/?ref_=tturv_usr_439_t,14-Sep-22,7,/10,

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8133624/?ref_=tturv_perm_441,Madness and chaos in a very short period..... confusing?,"This is a odd movie to review. From a effects and action stand point, its mind blowing. You feel the madness, the chaos, the multiverse come to life.There is ALOT of things you didn't see in the trailer. So much stuff that you are sort of bombarded with it non-stop. Alot of people like Strange have crazy amounts of powers now which may or may not confuse you or wonder ""Why didn't they do this before?"".Then you have new girl whos power is kind of really boring frankly. I mean I enjoy the idea of what she can do and indeed does in the movie, but if her story was a lone movie, I'd probably skipped it. And as much as they try to make her somewhat of the main focus, you don't care all that much about her or her powers.The funnest aspect of this movie is seeing Scarlet Witch and Dr Strange showing off some new stuff. I can't go into detail as this is a non-spoiler review. But I will say I was super impressed with all the new stuff we see. Especially a call back to the ""What If"" series but not animated.Now, why is the movie only a 7? For as wonderful as this movie is, it feels rushed given it barley runs under two hours. This should have also been extended in length so it felt less rushed, chaotic and confusing. This is not to say you don't know whats going on per say, but everything moves so fast you don't really get time to rest and think about what just happened.I know some were disappointed with a big scene that we seen in a trailer and where it lead. But I wasn't. It was nice seeing this scene and knowing how much more it opens up the future of the MCU. The ending was also something I was ok with. With the MCU you never know what to expect in the future.I will say this movie is much darker then any other MCU movie. It really felt like a MCU meets horror mix. Which was amazing in many ways. But I don't think little kids could handle this as it would likely be very scary for them. And, again without spoiler, this is the second time you get a gruesome scene in the MCU (all be it not fully shown), it might be to much for kids.Obviously given movie wise the last movie before this was SpiderMan, I am comparing them to each other in terms of which I liked more. Spider Man blew my mind. But then again so did this. I'd say they are tied in terms of how great they are. Again though, this movie should have been closer to Spider Mans runtime.If you still are undecided, I highly recommend seeing this in the theaters. The effects and sound design just won't be as good on a tv.",1,1,rchosen-193-5535,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur57306456/?ref_=tturv_usr_441_t,11-May-22,7,/10,

The pairing of Scarlet Witch and Dr. Strange was significantly better than the pairing of the Hulk and Thor in Thor: Ragnarok. I also thought the dynamic between the two leads was better than the pairing of Dr. Strange and Spiderman. That said, this latest MCU installment gets demerits for releasing a movie that diverges from the usual family fun MCU that I've been accustomed to. In fact when we left the theatre, my young daughters friend had tears in her eyes. ""It was so gory"" she said. She wasn't wrong. I also left the theatre unsettled and disturbed by what I just watched. Not that I have a problem with horror, but if I want to see a horror film, I would go see a horror film. I was here with my kids for a big-screen adaption of a superhero comic. Instead, this movie just left a bad taste in my mouth. Beyond some of the unnecessary violence, I do have to give credit to Benedict Cumberbatch, Elizabeth Olsen, Benedict Wong and Rachel McAdams for their strong performances.

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8126969/?ref_=tturv_perm_446,Fantastically Strange,"Although I watched this movie the 1st day (to avoid spoilers coming my way), it took me a while t o write this review. There has been a lot of mixed opinions about this movie and I was also thinking over and weighing in my thoughts. I did not walk about of the theatre disappointed, but 2 days later I do not recall anything significant apart from the absolutely brilliant visual effects tailored for IMAX experience.Dr Strange in the Multiverse of Madness was always heading to be a complex movie considering what MARVEL had built up to it in the recent past. However, it lacks the strong purpose that needs to justify the movie for what it is. It is also heavily linked to Disney+ series' Wandavision and What If but it did not relate to the events from Loki which I thought would directly lead to this movie. Don't say they didn't warn you because Kevin Fiege had literally mentioned about the Disney+ series' being connected to a lot of movies in the future. This may serve the loyal fans very well and give satisfaction but this can be a risky move considering the bigger crowd. The movie of course is brilliantly made and the visuals are just breathtaking. I had loved the visual effects in the first Dr Strange movie and this movie took that to another level. The spooky elements is something new for a MARVEL movie, however it also helps this movie to lean on a bit to the darker side. The background score is unique and adds well to the overall experience.This movie somehow falls short on expectations with the depth given to its character. Although Cumberbach eases through his role, his character does not have what it takes us to connect at an emotional level. Elizabeth Olsen is pretty good as Wanda, but her role almost makes it feel like we are watching the second season of WandaVision and most of us can totally expect what happens with her character in the climax. Xochitl Gomez as America Chavez is a very important character but the lack of writing and backstory doesn't make it so much. In fact we could have almost done without her character as well.Benedict Wong probably is the most likeable of all and also contributes to the major part of the humour in this movie. I do not want to give out spoilers on the cameos, but all I can say is that I expected much much more and much different from them.Dr Strange in the Multiverse of the Madness madness is definitely a satisfying IMAX 3D experience. The majority of my rating is owing to that because it definitely felt worth the buck. But when you think back long and hard you may start to have a tiny bit of worry for the new MARVEL strategy.",4,5,sujanfaster,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur35235050/?ref_=tturv_usr_446_t,8-May-22,8,/10,
https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8245512/?ref_=tturv_perm_447,Just because someone stumbles and loses their way doesn't mean they're lost forever,"Directed by Sam Raimi, who is making his first Marvel movie and first superhero outing since completing his pre-MCU webslinging trilogy in 2007 with Spider-Man 3, Multiverse of Madness lives up to its title in all sorts of ways. This is indeed a ride through a weird and often bonkers house of mirrors known as the multiverse, full of mind-bending moments, trippy twists, and a fistful of surprises.It's also very much a Sam Raimi movie, and perhaps the most singularly identifiable vision of an MCU director since James Gunn sprang Guardians of the Galaxy on us nearly eight years ago. And more to the point, it's a Sam Raimi horror movie, or at least what one would look like in the Marvel sandbox. Demons, monsters, reanimated corpses, jump scares, doppelgangers, and supernatural manifestations fill every corner of the screen, as Raimi races from scene to scene with barely a breath in between.At the the centre of the madness: the unworkable and out-of-reach love affair between Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) and Christine Palmer (Rachel McAdams) and, more importantly, the obsessive quest of Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) to find her children somewhere out there in the multiverse... children that her fraying mind refuses to believe don't actually exist.It's Wanda's search for her two sons, directly following up the events of 2021's WandaVision TV series, that makes it fortuitous when she crosses paths with America Chavez (Xochitl Gomez), a young woman who seems to be the only person in existence with the ability to travel between universes. But America's power is also exceedingly dangerous to the existence of any universe through which she passes, forcing Strange, Sorcerer Supreme Wong (Benedict Wong), and Wanda to face some hard, strange choices as they realise the fate of all the realities is at stake.I won't reveal much more than that, but Multiverse of Madness rolls out its narrative in fits and starts, and Raimi's headlong, head-spinning approach to storytelling occasionally leads the director to get in his own way. Reflecting its own title, Multiverse of Madness has a frantic, on-the-edge-of-losing-control feel that sends it careening toward its next set-piece while the rest of us catch up.Later on Doctor Strange is introduced to the famed Marvel Comics tribunal known as the Illuminati, that will make a number of heads in the audience explode. There is fan service here aplenty, some of it already hinted at and some unexpected.It's also a moment that feels like it's right out of the comics, and if anything, Raimi leans hard into comic book imagery, even more so than in any of his three Spider-Man movies. In fact, Multiverse of Madness might be the most outright comic book-y film in the entire MCU to date, not an easy task in a film series based on more than six decades of the damn things. But whereas earlier MCU installments might have held back or spoon-fed their more bizarre elements, Multiverse of Madness throws it all against the wall in often messy yet gloriously bizarre fashion.Cumberbatch has grown increasingly comfortable in Strange's cloak with each of his now six live-action appearances in the MCU, and he's ably assisted by Wong, who throws off a lot of his previous ""funny sidekick"" vibe in favor of a more substantial presence. McAdams, reduced to little more than a stand-in in the original 2016 Doctor Strange origin story, is also given more to do. Gomez, who's got appealing screen presence and fits the part, is too often reduced to the role of exposition machine in the course of the film's events, and her performance suffers for it.The top acting honours, however, go to Olsen as Wanda, who brings real, palpable, heartbreaking grief to the part along with an electrifying single-mindedness that makes you believe she's one of the most powerful people in the MCU. The arc started for Wanda way back in 2015's Avengers: Age of Ultron reaches its summit here, and Olsen gives it her all with raw force.Visually the film isn't always striking but there are Raimi trademarks aplenty, including whip pans, sudden tilts, zooms, and inside-out viewpoints. It comes to life the most during its trippier sequences, including one showstopping plunge through a cascading series of universes that is psychedelic and strangely unnerving.Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness probably won't earn any new fans for the MCU, and it may even turn some moviegoers off as it's definitely a harder, more violent, and macabre outing than we've seen from Marvel to date. It also doesn't always land right; it's shaggy and occasionally jumps its own tracks. But it will please the legions of established fans by embracing the comic book weirdness of it all with vigor and abandon, as Sam Raimi creates possibly the MCU's most off-the-wall entry yet. Ironic that it would take such a crazily unsteady but rich movie to help steady the Marvel ship.",0,0,adamsmith-51004,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur61456303/?ref_=tturv_usr_447_t,17-Jun-22,7,/10,

There was also a horror feel to many of the scenes which is a nice change of tone from the usual Marvel films.Dr strange's unique abilities allowed for a lot of creative leeway as does the multiverse in general. There is one particular scene with the use of music which i thought worked well, though not perfectly. At times I was wondering whether I was loving the scene or absolutely hating it. There were also a few times when i thought that CGI was overdone or could have looked better but i was able to deal with it in the end.I enjoyed the story. Despite taking place in the multiverse, the story was relatively simply, straight forward and contained which worked well.There are some interesting features in this... but they are best witnessed for first time on the big screen... Cumberbatch as Dr Strange was solid as usual and new girl America Chavez was a good addition that worked well with Dr Strange.The best performance was from Elisabeth Olsen who is fantastic as Wanda as we saw in the Disney+ WandaVision series.

This film was an exciting thrill ride throughout, utilizing the standard Marvel formula and combining it with the artistic visual style of director Sam Raimi. This film was visually unlike any Marvel film, using a plethora of camera angles, transitions, and movements that will constantly bend the mind of the viewer. Although the visuals are brilliant, the film also focuses on the emotional aspect of the characters, providing heartfelt and breaking moments that are satisfying for fans of the characters. This is perfectly accompanied by masterclass performances from each actor, giving life, relatability, and heart into each line delivered or facial expression given. The cameos that occur, despite their briefness, are effective in their presentation and will undoubtedly excite. The film, however, feels a little rushed in the beginning, establishing everything the audience needs to know in a quick manner.

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8129891/?ref_=tturv_perm_456,Great visuals ruined by the too many trailers and the crammed script,"Unfortunately, the film is not what I expected. There is only one problem that it carries and that is the storyline or the script. The film is too much, it is way too full of madness. The events are crammed in a random way which resulted in a bad script. So many characters and so many events all in a short runtime which is 2 h only. A film like that should've held a runtime of at least 2h 30m. I really liked how the film gets right into the story, since it doesn't need an introduction because the past Marvel Events/films are already an introduction like Wandavision, Infinity War, Endgame, and No Way Home. However, it still felt rushed, and I blame the script for that. By the time I got to the third act, my head was hurting as it couldn't receive additional information due to the crammed and rushed events the story had for 2 acts. I felt like I lost track of the story because it was moving too fast and it was a lot to take in as at times it felt heavy.In addition, the trailers spoiled so many things. At this point, I don't want to watch future trailers of future Marvel films due to the too much information it gives. It would've been way better if that info were held until the release of the film as it would've been better as a surprise.Benedict Cumberbatch returns once again as Doctor Steven Strange in a great performance as usual. Even tho he didn't present anything new in this film, he was still great. Loved how the film showed the improvement that Doctor Strange had and the lessons that he learned from the previous events in previous Marvel Films like No Way Home as the character development was obvious. For the past years, Marvel was hinting that Wanda is the strongest Avenger in which this film finally presented the powerful Wanda Maximoff in a way that was never seen before. We were able to see her in a new and unique way as her superpowers reached their full limit. For the first time, America Chavez is presented on screen and it was obvious that she was there just to support the story of the film which discusses the multiverse and that is relevant to her superpowers. Her appearance meant nothing other than supporting the story. I felt no empathy towards her even though the film discussed a bit about her past. But again, the script was weak and full of random events thrown there and that's it.Once again, Sam Raimi returns to direct another Marvel film in which he presented something completely new and unique. Really enjoyed the horror aspect this film had in which it is obvious that Raimi's style is present. The great cinematography of Mathieson and the music of Danny Elfman help in delivering the horror aspect, especially in jumpscare scenes. The use of low angle shots as well as the different transitions from one scene to another like the fade transition/cross dissolve and the Iris which was used very well.The Visual effects are very bad. At times you can tell that they are cheap and not well made like Steven Strange's ponytail hair or his suit-up scene where he was flying. It looked like it came out from a 60s film.Overall, the film's only flaw is the script and the visual effects that for me matters so much which is why it lost a lot of points for it and therefore my rating is 6.5/10.(Watched in IMAX theatre)",2,3,Aziz24,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur105044330/?ref_=tturv_usr_456_t,9-May-22,6,/10,
https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8121543/?ref_=tturv_perm_457,Sam Raimi's introduction to the MCU is a fun one,"The good: Sam Raimi's direction is excellent. The film's pace is brisk and a nice break from the 3 hour epics marvel has been producing lately. The action is plentiful and the magic is magical. The acting is top knotch from everyone involved and the visuals are just as trippy as the first film. There are certain emotional bits the film needed to nail and it does indeed nail it.The bad: Wanda being the bad guy again. I had genuinely thought she put that behind her in Wandavision, so for her to turn bad again in this was kind of a waste.

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8329967/?ref_=tturv_perm_462,Kinda a let down.,Doctor Strange in the multiverse of madness follows Dr. Strange as he travels the multiverse looking for a book that can help him stop an old friend. The movie was a let down and I only say that because of what we got in Spider-Man and that the movie was overhyped. The movie has an engaging story with some great CGI and great humour and it continues off from Wandavision. The movie does have some amazing cameos half way though the movie which fans will love.Benedict Cumberbatch as always plays Doctor Strange and it's perfect what else is there to say. He plays 3 different versions of the Doctor. The one we have seen before. One where he is a zombie and one where he is evil. Benedict Wong returns as Wong and he is hilarious but also gets a lot more to do now. Elizabeth Olsen returns as Wanda And It continues off her story from wandavision. She has become the main bad guy and is willing to do whatever it takes to find her children she plays a scary villain. It was really terrifying to see her this way and kinda sad to see her fall so low. Xochitl Gomez plays new hero America Chavez she plays that young girl who doesn't know how to control her powers and is leaning the ropes. Rachel McAdams also comes back as Christine where she plays her normal self and then a different version where she is more badass and kinda gives a send off between her and Strange.Overall the movie wasn't bad but it was a let down.,0,0,kobemackenzie,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur104341979/?ref_=tturv_usr_462_t,13-Jul-22,8,/10,

While there certainly are alternate realities and cameos its very much the original pitch that dominates proceedings and the right call was definitely made.Probably more than any other director so far, Sam Rami is given reign to put his stamp all over the movie and he has no time for deep dive multiverse nonsense. In fact the one big cameo section is treated almost as a bait and switch joke which, while it will undoubtedly annoy some fans, works perfectly for this film. Most of runtime plays out like a Terminator film with our heroes trying to escape an unstoppable foe and there are plenty of Rami tricks (and Evil Dead references) along the way, although it it a little (Dr) strange to see this amount of editing in an MCU film.There are some moments of genuine horror for a family film and, an uninspiring attack on the Wizard stronghold of Kamer-Taj aside, plenty of visual flourishes to match the first Dr Strange movie. There are a couple of problems, attempts to illicit sympathy with villain fall flat and some of the stylistic choices made will put some viewers off but it stands as one of the more unique and interesting Marvel offerings.",3,1,danchilton-71955,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur68828911/?ref_=tturv_usr_465_t,17-May-22,8,/10,

It was an interesting decision to bring back Raimi, and it might've been different if they had given him final cut, but I'm just surmising that Disney might've tampered with his vision. There were bright spots, specifically the creative visuals, and the third act that improved upon the previous two. But the flaws overshadowed the majority of the film. I have a slight issue with the Multiverse infatuation that Hollywood seems to be experiencing right now. As it pertains to this film, the concept of there being infinite universes lowers the stakes of the story, and possibly even negatively impacts the significance of previous films in the MCU. Additionally, Elizabeth Olsen's performance was shaky, the tone appeared to be unintentionally silly, and America Chavez was more of a plot tool to give them access to the multiverse rather than a genuine character. Trying to be bigger and more complex is not always the best route to a great film, especially in this case.",2,3,JackCowart34,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur104530491/?ref_=tturv_usr_470_t,7-Jul-22,4,/10,

Also, at this stage of the game, we're past origin stories. This is the stage where all our familiar characters fight... and die. It's coming...The multiverse and parallel worlds are so up Dr. Strange's alley. And to go up against a desperate Scarlet Witch really showcased her power that Infinity Wars and Endgame failed to capture. Jumping worlds and Keeping track of the same characters from different worlds was a great puzzle put together which I can appreciate. Honestly, Dr Strange is one of my favorites in the MCU because it's a little more complicated than the simple ""hero-saves-world"" model. I did appreciate this one.

It provides plenty of fan-service, plenty of action and visual effects, but very little logic.A trend in the more recent Marvel movies is how comic-booky the MCU is. In the first Avengers movie, aliens invaded New York through a sky portal and the city was like a war zone, with people acting accordingly. Now when people see a giant tentacular monster crashing through the city, they say ""awesome"" and get their phones out, assuming that some super-hero will deal with it. Maybe that is how it would actually be...Maybe it is this sensibility that causes the movie to lack any real feeling of threat, of actual stakes. Even when characters die, there is no sense of shock or loss.Having said all that, Dr Strange 2 is a comic-book movie, and maybe we should not expect more than that.

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8280549/?ref_=tturv_perm_478,"Fun, but I have no idea what happened","The MCU is in a bit of a spiral, as one would expect after investing hugely in a massive series of inter-connecting stories that somehow manage to connect in a sensible way all the way to a satisfying conclusion. We are now several years past Endgame, and there is no indication that the MCU is going to be capable of pulling off that kind of massive storyline again.In some ways, I'm ok with this. I've never been a comicbook fan, but my impression is that each comic is episodic and does not necessarily link to the rest in a way that would make sense. If the movies are going down that path, it only makes sense... though it also means it is easier for Disney to crank out stories to make money without making sure that there is a coherent universe. The MCU fits this style better than, say, Star Wars or Jurassic Park.Back to Dr Strange. I really couldn't tell you what the plot was or what happened or how the characters grew. I enjoyed the spectacle, and I really enjoyed the horror elements Raimi brought to it. It felt darker and a bit more serious in tone than most other MCU films.

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8119944/?ref_=tturv_perm_480,It's best to just let the creatives create,"Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, the sequel to 2016's Doctor Strange, continues to delve into the mystical side of the Marvel Cinematic Universe as our favorite wizards battle a number of multiversal threats willing to destroy it all to achieve their goals. Doctor Stephen Strange, former Sorcerer Supreme, is forced to deal with threats both old and new as he traverses universes to protect America Chavez, a young woman born with the ability to naturally hop through universes as she's being hunted. With assistance from trusty ally Wong, Strange appeals to former Avenger Wanda Maximoff for help in fending off this new threat to reality.Multiverse of Madness is what happens when a filmmaker is presented with the option of delivering massive dopamine hits to their willing audience or telling a layered story that decides to progress the characters instead of the overall narrative of the MCU. Luckily, writer Michael Waldron (also responsibly for the Loki show on Disney+), director Sam Raimi, and cinematographer John Mathieson choose to tackle the latter, deepening the relationship between Strange and Christine Palmer, further exploring Wanda's pain and desires, and introducing Xochitl Gomez as America Chavez. In what has become a now famous MCU move of not fully adapting the source material from which some of the films draw their inspiration, Raimi and company manage to match the tone of 2005's House of M storyline without ever actually cribbing from it. Themes of learning to trust, facing past regrets, and wants vs needs are fully explored throughout the movie. While some fans have been primed for cameos galore, Raimi keeps the story in check, keeping the cameos to a small handful that are still sure to delight and stoke the endless fires of speculation. In the same vein that Captain America: Civil War was a star-studded event that still strongly focused on its titular character, the same can be said for Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness: regardless of who shows up, Doctor Strange is front and center, appearing in almost every frame of the movie. Raimi and Waldron never lose sight of the fact that this is Stephen Strange's film, a fact that, in the hands of less talented filmmakers (or filmmakers less willing to stick to their guns), might've been their doom. Raimi's horror sensibilities are on full display, setting the grimmest tone seen in an MCU movie yet. While not full-on horror (it's Disney after all), Raimi manages to push that envelope as far as he possibly can while adhering to the universe set up before his arrival. The end result is a bleak, relentless movie that still manages to deliver on the fun adventure and surprises that MCU fans have come to expect.Benedict Cumberbatch, returning to the MCU for his sixth appearance, proves yet again why he was the perfect casting for the character of Doctor Strange. Cumberbatch's ability to play intelligent, arrogant men is put on full display at the beginning of the film, giving audiences the most accurate representation of the character yet. At this point fully comfortable in the role, Cumberbatch plays the good doctor this time out with an ounce of melancholy tinged at the edges of his performance. Where Cumberbatch leaves the character in the movie's closing moments as compared to its opening proves Strange has gone on a massive journey, both physically and figuratively. Shaping up to be one of the backbones of the MCU, Cumberbatch's steady, dependable performance will be a delight to see for years to come.I say all that to say Elizabeth Olsen puts Cumberbatch to shame in almost every frame of the movie. Stealing scene after scene, Olsen has never been better as Wanda Maximoff than she is in Multiverse of Madness. An impetus for the events of the film, Olsen's Wanda is a woman with a one track mind: getting back to her kids first seen WandaVision. It's Wanda's sole drive in the movie and Olsen leans fully into peeling back every layer of the character. While playing multiple versions of herself, Olsen gets to display a range of emotions from bitter disgust to outright despair. Even when not on screen, Wanda's presence is felt, easily making her the standout character of the entire movie.Unfortunately, not every character gets a chance to shine like Wanda does. Mainly, the disservice falls to Xochitl Gomez as America Chavez, member of the Young Avengers. While the MCU has been quietly introducing all the members in the background of other movies, America is a key character of Multiverse of Madness. It's this fact that makes the viewing frustrating to realize how little development the character gets, outside of a minute or two of backstory. As the film's overall Living McGuffin, America is hunted and pursued by any numbers of creatures, and while it's Stephen Strange's mission to keep her safe, the story does scant little to give us a reason to care about her. While Xochitl does a good job with the material she's given, there's times where she disappears from the film completely, sacrificed either in editing or in the writing stages to give more time for developing other relationships. Possibly the film's biggest disappointment, Xochitl's presence is a delight when she's on screen and absence noticed when she's not. Disney did somehow less than the bare minimum in regard to America's orientation; a character in the comics that's unabashedly, proudly lesbian gets little more than a mention of having two mothers and an LGBTQ pin on her infamous denim jacket. There's plenty more left to be mined with America, and hopefully Xochitl gets the screen time she deserves going forward.Returning for larger roles than anticipated are Rachel McAdams as nurse Christine Palmer and Benedict Wong, the current Sorcerer Supreme. The relationship between Palmer and Strange is the heart of the film, kicked off by a seemingly simple question that becomes one of the motifs throughout. While the MCU has had a varying amount of success when it comes to portraying relationships, Strange and Palmer's is certainly one of the more interesting ones. Playing off decisions made during the 2016 Doctor Strange, viewers meet Palmer as she's getting married, with Stephen in the audience. An interplay between them somewhat reminiscent of the exchange between Tony and Pepper at the bar in the first Iron Man but with a more somber tone, it's clear that Strange and Palmer's relationship on screen is one of the MCU's most complex. Benedict Wong, slimmed down and looking better than ever, is a delight as Wong, Strange's right hand man and staunchest ally. With an increased role due to his responsibilities as the Sorcerer Supreme, Wong is allotted more screen time and more to do with that screen time. In a few scant appearances since his debut in the first movie, Wong's glowup from sanctum librarian to head wizard has been a joy to experience and the bond between him and Strange make for some of the highlights of the movie.Almost 20 years to the exact date of the release of his first superhero movie, director Sam Raimi returns to the big budget blockbuster world of capes and tights to deliver a movie that only he could make. Featuring all the familiar camera angles, shot compositions, and tonal uneasiness we've come to expect from him, Multiverse of Madness is just as much a Raimi film as it is an MCU movie. While it's unfortunate previous director Scott Derrickson exited the project due to creative differences, the end result should make the audience appreciate living in the universe where this film exists. Drawing from his previous works that are signature Raimi style, the veteran director (not seen since 2013's Oz the Great and Powerful) managed to create a tone and feel far more sinister than anything imagined within the MCU thus far. What we get are the classic elements of horror: jump scares, unyielding dreadful tension, and outrageously vivid creature work. Kicking the film off by dropping the audience into the middle of an action scene and keeping his foot on the pedal, Raimi's first and third acts are amongst some of the best in the MCU. Unfortunately, the second act slows the story down drastically once the multiverse is fully established. Handling Strange's story, his relationship with Christine Palmer, Wanda's story, and the introduction of America Chavez and the multiverse is a tall order with a lot of moving parts, and those parts don't always rub up against each other in ways that flow naturally. Raimi makes up for these incongruent pieces with some top notch action scenes that give the characters the opportunities to display a full array of their power sets. For everything that doesn't work in the movie (namely, the second act slog and the handling of America Chavez), Raimi manages to provide enough good to counterbalance that.Overall, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness proves that, in most cases, it's best to just let the creatives create. Sam Raimi manages to walk the tightrope balancing MCU storytelling with his unique style, blending them to create an experience that is both familiar to diehards while simultaneously being wholly refreshing. Far darker in tone than any previous film to date, the magical realm of the MCU continues to be developed and fleshed out in creative and entertaining ways. While still firmly Benedict Cumberbatch's movie, Elizabeth Olsen dominates every scene she's in, delivering a captivating and heart wrenching performance that will forever cement her in the annals of great MCU actors. At just a hair over two hours, the movie starts at a breakneck pace and ends in a similar fashion while possibly leaving more questions than it answers. An absolute must-see in the IMAX format if possible, the movie is a jaw dropping spectacle filled with great characters moments, small nuggets of contained surprises, and dynamic set pieces.",3,3,dmansel,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur123353548/?ref_=tturv_usr_480_t,6-May-22,7,/10,

Elizabeth Olsen delivers a truly terrifying new side to the Scarlet Witch that has been long awaited in the Marvel fanbase, and she doesn't disappoint with it. Xochitl Gomez introduces a new, lovable character to the MCU: America Chavez. Not only are her powers something to get excited about for future multiversal trips, but she's easily a fun, wholesome character with lots of spunk. Benedict Cumberbatch is always a delight to see as Doctor Strange, and a lot of his new spells and tricks are something to get hyped about. And I couldn't make a review on it without mentioning that amazing soundtrack that blends amazingly with the scenes. This movie is full of action, and while there aren't a lot of new universes explored, and the movie does feel a little fast, it still holds its ground and gives the audience a good time while not overwhelming them.

It feels like the Sam Raimi version and the generic safe Marvel movie fight each other constantly in this. We get some serious horror elements and arguably the most violent scenes we've seen in the MCU, as well as some very creative and cool shots. It's acted well across the board, I don't think there was any bad acting. I thought they did a good job of making sure America Chavez didn't become the main character as well. Some downsides here, there is some bad cgi but I'm willing to forgive it since a lot of this film has to be cgi.The more and more I think about this film and the awesome individual scenes the more I feel like this could have been better. It is by no means bad, far from anywhere near the worst MCU films, in fact it's up with the best of the best during some points. I really wanted to give this an 8 but I feel like a 7 is more fitting.

But the are scenes where we see his creative vision is present, and I wish that vision were throughout the film. And this film is the pinnacle of mediocre with its world-building. For a movie that explores the multiverse, it feels more constricting than No Way Home. I think the multiverse characters immersed us in No Way Home. Unlike in M. O. M, the world they travel to isn't like something we haven't seen before. And the cameos are not bad, but they are present in the movie. And so many stories beat come and go, it doesn't feel rushed, but it feels underwhelming. This movie is like a museum guide speedrunning the tour. Besides a few of the director's visions being the best part of the film, Wanda and Strange are amazing. People complain about Wanda's character, claiming it should've been resolved in WandaVision. Well, it's not M. O. M's fault. It's the people in Marvel not supervising the main story.Despite Wanda being an annoying Karen sometimes, I did sympathize with the grief she holds, and the lengths she would take are understandable but still wrong. And Strange's arc in thinking sometimes there is another way, whereas Spidarman's arc doesn't know there is no other way but to accept the consequences. For Strange, it's a switch, where he must accept not to make reckless decisions by himself without any repercussion. And America Chavez is boring. Her emotions are just snarky, and she knows almost everything, girl.But what's more annoying is when she doesn't take things seriously, as the revelation of her parents is just shrugged off like ok, whatever. How can we like a character if she doesn't give us a reason what to like about her? Lastly, her powers explain the mediocrity of the plot elements. It's too convenient. Overall it's a mediocre or middle-of-the-road film, execution-wise. They could've gone beyond, but somehow, this movie felt so at face value. Marvel should stop trying to make all their movies for kids or a safe audience.

Elizabeth Olsen's Scarlet witch is the only acting performance worth praise, she has literally nailed her role.The film however suffers from a lot of cons which pulls it back. Wastage of multiverse along with its potential characters is a cardinal sin and this one sadly is filled with it. Mediocre script, horror sequences and climax is another factor that reduces the whole impact of this flick. Good actors wasted is another hard thing to watch and the film at times relies too much on it for entertainment. Useless post credits is another disappointing factor of this event.

Dr. Strange has stayed with me since his epic debut, but this had me lost.Okay so the action and special effects were on point as usual. But thats really all I can say here. I mean I felt as if Doctor Strange was only there to explain everything, there wasn't any time for his classic mannerisms or further development. I mean he barely acknowledged his past, if at all! Just mumbo jumbo about different universes. The music was great and it had a horror vibe to it to top off the decently violent imagery. For real, there are parts that could have earned it an R rating. But thats no reason to hide this from your kids- your kids won't understand this movie anyway.It brings me disappointment, I never wanted to leave a Marvel movie so badly. Yes, it is gorgeous, ambitious, and introduces new characters we've been hoping to see. But Im sorry, they packed way too much into this movie. You won't be bored, you'll be exhausted.

She goes from making portals, to using blue energy, to somehow overpowering Wanda??? Then reverts back to training with Doctor Strange??? Tell me how that makes sense.Marvel took a risk here.

The core premise of this movie is that a version of wanda who can only fairly be described as mentally impaired, slaughters her way across multiple realities in the pursuit of children who never existed to begin with. All the while choosing to ignore the blatant and inescapable truths that 1: she is not and never was a mother 2: The only possible way for her to become a mother of the specific children she wants is by killing another version of herself, robbing the kids of their real mother. It is incredibly dumb, the movie is roughly 2 hours and 6 minutes long and we spend all of it watching wanda be the dumbest creature in multiple realitiesSloppy writing:
-A certain character divulges their motiviation is to find someone important to them, they have the ability to very very easily make this happen yet with no discernable reason whatsoever abandon this mission and goes off to do inconsequential tasks instead.Continuing on this point, not only does it make the movie contradict it's own premise every 2 minutes but also completely undermines wandas motivation, because if the realities and main characters are as identical as this movie shows them to be then there are only 2 possibilities. 1: No version of wanda would be a muderous lunatic trying to break reality in pursuit of fictional children. 2: Every version of wanda would have snapped and there would be a horde of reality hopping/dream walking/projecting wandas having a war betwen themselves.The movie tries to have it both ways, but since the story has less consistency than the scribbles of an ADHD toddler the end result is a disjointed, self contradicting mess with absolutely no semblance of story telling taking place.",1,1,Nob0dy,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur124292999/?ref_=tturv_usr_504_t,31-Jul-23,6,/10,

They've got plenty of creative juice deploying every trick of the mystical arts and witchcrafts in such a quirky way. Adding to this is the horror theme that amplify the mystic elements surrounding the world of Dr Strange. Sam Raimi directed Evil Dead and for those who are familiar with his work, you could really sense a vibe of his renowned horror film. And talking about horror, if you're a big fan of Evil Dead or IT: Chapter 1 & 2, you'll love this. They make use of bizarre visuals to mess with your brain and elevate the experience by utilizing jumpscares that may shock younger viewers.Sam Raimi really did capture the art of modern cinematography and I love that there's a sway or wave of movements with how he or the ASC holds the camera to produce such enigmatic motions.No one could have played Scarlet Witch as awesome as Olsen. Her transformation from a lovely mother figure to someone who's evil and depressed is really convincing, I even symphatize with her. Her nuances of emotions when she speaks really brings her character to life. Dr Strange, like his name, is well... Strange-r. His character has become more complete and wholesome compared to where he was when he first came to the MCU. But his character is somehow used in a way as a device to further tell the story of the multiverse instead of making him a real superhero character. I didn't feel much excitement seeing him this time.Making her debut appearance in Marvel, America Chavez has an interesting backstory with a huge potential of being likeable by the audience but... they made a mistake by not introducing her earlier in the franchise, putting her character at stake as she's responsible for carrying the whole movie with Dr Strange & Scarlet Witch. The problem here lies on her story where it's too rushed and not appropriately established, resulting in a disengagement of the audience with her. Marvel should have prolonged this film to a 3-hour focusing on her or made a mini-series about her on Disney Plus or at least, an episode of Marvel's What If...?.The biggest problem with Dr Strange 2 is it doesn't maximize its potential to utilize the 'multiverse' concept properly. This is supposed to be bigger than No Way Home. Heck, should have been the biggest of all, putting Infinity War and Endgame behind. But the result was moderately disappointing. They didn't fully put their heart and soul to making this film and understanding the demands. Yes, the film is good but by the end, you'll think, 'that's it?'Here's the thing, the first Dr Strange caught me off guard because of how gigantic the visual scope was presented on the screen. It's a visual-gasm movie. However, with the success of the first film and with the gripping 'multiverse' concept as the focal point, audience's expectation is off the roof. Dr Strange In the Multiverse of Madness suffers from the extravagant title that fails to live up with its hype.Is it Multiverse enough? Barely. You'd expect the film will jump into so many different universes. Well, expect less... very less 😂. The low-budget Everything Everywhere All at Once shows us even more universes than this. And when they did stuck in a universe, that universe wasn't interesting enough.Is it Madness enough? Quite. There's a certain level of madness to it but deciding 'Multiverse of Madness' as its title is mind-boggling. It's just not and that's a fact. The title would be better off 'The Madness of the Witch'.The film is messy enough with a lot of terms and subplots that are not clearly explained or provided a justification for existing. Particularly in the third act, everything happened quickly as they try to explain major things that led to what have happened throughout or navigate the things that are happening without putting much effort into its weightage of storytelling.A lack of cameos was what killed me. It's THE multiverse? Why not use this opportunity to have dozens of cameos appear? It only takes 1 sec for a beloved character to appear and audience would have been happy. But they didn't make this happen. They felt it's better to show every cameo in TV Spots and trailers and put a stop at surprising fans with more.For a multiverse film, I was underwhelmed with how the VFX looked like. I'm not sure the reason being the budget or the scope or the lack of experience or understanding of the direction given by the head VFX to the team, but it's mediocre for a mega film that is previously known for its success of its VFX. Truly, Everything Everywhere All at Once has better VFX with only a team of 5-7 people.Even the transition mostly is downright awful, felt like it could've been better and more polished.There's a certain tone of cheesiness that I felt this movie could have thrown it out and replaced it with something more solid or ominous as it brings in the horror genre for the first in MCU. There were times the tone reminded me of Garner's Elektra and Affleck's Daredevil that turned me off once in a while.Verdict: Somewhere in other universe, Dr Strange In the Multiverse of Madness might be the best MCU film ever made but in ours, it is a letdown for such a colossal film. Luckily, the witch casts a spell resulting in a film that is entertaining to watch.",3,6,iamianiman,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur58447224/?ref_=tturv_usr_521_t,5-May-22,6,/10,

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8130568/?ref_=tturv_perm_526,2nd best Marvel film,"I thoroughly enjoyed DSMM, even with its flaws.The action was consistent, the pace and flow was excellent, the visuals incredible, and the acting was where it needed to be. From a technical aspect, this movie was almost flawless.The conversion of Wanda to Scarlett Witch and the power calibration of Wanda/Scarlett Witch and Dr. Strange was viable and based on precedent. When Wanda is emotionally taxed, her destructive abilities come through. And no Avenger has been assaulted, emotionally, more than Wanda. You absolutely have to have seen WandaVision to understand this, as well as to understand the character motivation, but it all fits together nicely. And as far as her powers; we must remember, she went toe to toe with Thanos, one on one, and was on her way to beating him. And that was the more passive Wanda, not the Witch.My gripes? Well, while Olsen does well here, she doesn't always 'get there' regarding her suffering from not being with her children. And there is some lack of originality in the drivers of DSMM. We've certainly seen much of DSMM before; the child prodigy, the desperate mother, the seduction of good based on emotional loss. After the first few beatdowns, I was even a bit afraid that we'd be heading into Dark Phoenix territory (and wouldn't a Scarlett Witch vs Dark Phoenix catfight be to die for), but Olsen's portrayal of the maternally driven Witch softened the boring invulnerability of what Turner brought to Phoenix. I would have appreciated a bit more build up to what tipped Wanda to the dark side (maybe some montage footage of her relationship with Vision, as well as her time with her brother), and I would have liked a bit more umpf! From Dr. Strange, who, at times, came across woefully weak vs the Witch.But all that stuff gets washed away with a fun narrative, as well as some interesting cameos that gets me giddy with the Multi-Verse's potential.If you are a Marvel fan, you will like this film. It's much better than what has stunk up the Marvel big screens post Endgame and pre-No Way Home (TV shows and Black Widow not included). Good to see Marvel back, and very good to see what is to come.

The trailers were great but once I heard that Sam Raimi was forced into 3+ months of reshoots, the runtime was only 2h and 6m and that the ending wasn't even written yet when filming started I was worried. Though it wasn't nearly as bad as some other comic-book films that have suffered from reshoots (i.e. Fan4stic, Suicide Squad, Justice League, etc) it was still obvious. Many plot points, characters and especially the first act felt very rushed. Which is most likely due to the original runtime being 2h and 43m. However my favorite aspect about the film was Sam Raimi's direction, even with the reshoots his style managed to come through well. In fact there are a lot horror elements which were very reminiscent of the Evil Dead Films. Benedict Cumberbatch remains great as the title character and Elizabeth Olsen is the best she's ever been as Scarlett Witch.

More development of the Characters, Strange growing and showing further depth, Wanda's story particularly stunning following on from WandaVision and her breakdown, thankfully more for Christine Palmer to do, and then they manage not only to give a big introduction to America Chavez, AND the Illuminati (different line up to the Books, but still works), AND Wundagore, and Wanda's assault on Kama-Taj (not sure of the spelling) and Wanda facing off against the self-righteous Illuminati was a highlight... heck all in 2 hours, and so well paced, never lets up. And multiple Stranges too. Mind blowing - true Madness, in a good way.All in all, it could probably never quite match up to the likes of Endgame (with Avengers, Guardians and everyone else) and No Way Home with 3 Spidey's, but in extending the Multi-verse further, bringing in a host of new characters, and with Wanda as the main antagonist, one of very very few who could out-power Strange, inspired.

With the multiverse and horror elements in this film as well as Sam Rami's directing style, this film brings us a MCU film unlike anything we have seen before. Benedict Cumberbatch was magnificent as always as Doctor Strange bringing us a side of the character we have not yet seen before. Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda/Scarlett Witch was absolutely terrifying in every way possible and was definitely the standout character in the film. Benedict Wong as Wong is definitely the comic relief of the film also bringing us humor when it was needed. Xochitl Gomez as America Chavez brings us a very interesting character that is a great new addition to the MCU and I can't wait to see more of her. I also loved every bit of the cameos we got in this movie too and it helped make the film feel more multiversal. If I have any cons about this movie, it's I wish this movie was about 20 minutes longer and maybe a couple more cameos in this movie than they already had. Also, I wish there was more exploration of the multiverse and the characters too. Overall, this is a solid Marvel film that I'll always enjoy again and again.

And while he agreed on the fact that this could've been better, he blamed its flop on the hype.This is a movie starring Benedict Cumberbatch as Doctor Strange--arguably the super-hero with the most creative abilities in the MCU and also the most philosophical. It's directed by Sam Raimi, the mastermind behind the original Spider-Man trilogy and its theme involves multiverse travel. So, yes, of course it was hyped. But were these expectations not justified, especially considering how ingenious the 2016 prequel was? Personally, I think that while hype can raise expectations in the ridiculous, it wasn't the case with this movie. This is simply an average Marvel film. One which stretched its multi-dimensional plot too thin--even for Marvel standards.Admittedly, while I knew this movie was going to be less than impressive as I have seen some reviews prior to watching it, I really didn't see any issues until the very ending. The only thing I was thinking up until that point was how I was going to rebuke all these critics for not knowing how to have fun again. But the abrupt breaks Raimi decided to stop his run on were so unexpected I was almost shocked. Whether it was studio interference or simply an emergency writing unraveling, I don't know. The point is ""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness"" decided to cut its own cord in a brutal enough manner to sustain quite a bit of damage as if Marvel Studios' great dark shadow was breathing down Raimi's neck.It's a shame to see such potential simply breeze through the multiverses--literally; especially considering that this movie had a plot twist early on, really building up on itself. P. S. Though--this is the Marvel movie with the best visual effects yet--and that's saying something.",2,0,andrewburgereviews,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur86182727/?ref_=tturv_usr_563_t,11-Jul-22,5,/10,

Let his movies be strange and scary,"Sam Raimi lends the Marvel Cinematic Universe the same level of expertise that led to cult favorites like the Evil Dead movies and mainstream mega-hits such as his Spider-Man trilogy. And boy does it show in the best way possible.Benedict Cumberbatch returns as Dr. Stephen Strange who finds himself on an extra-dimensional hopping adventure with a plucky girl sidekick named America Chavez (yes really). He and his new ally encounter bizarre alien creatures, deadly doppelgangers, and a surprising new batch of Marvel characters.Plus a shocking appearance by Wanda Maximoff aka the Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen). Complicating matters for Dr. Strange is that Scarlet Witch has her own agenda that puts the multiverse at risk. Although I'm aware that her character's progression is probably not all that shocking after the events of 'WandaVision'.Benedict Cumberbatch brings the same sly intellect and snarky humor to the role of Dr. Strange that made his take on Sherlock Holmes a big success. He's believably clever but also kind of goofy. But one believes it's the same character. Not like how they reportedly treated the Thor character in 'Love and Thunder'.Elizabeth Olsen is pretty darn menacing in this movie. A big part of what makes MoM such a trippy and creepy movie is thanks to her go-for-broke performance as Scarlet Witch. Admittedly I didn't watch 'WandaVision' before seeing this but I think the script did a good enough job of explaining her motivation behind a lot of her actions in the plot.Speaking of the script, the movie does move at a fast pace compared to other Marvel movies. It's just enough over the two hour mark. But that is just right to get the job done.Sam Raimi clearly had fun using a Marvel movie sized budget to play with some grisly imagery and some truly outlandish CGI shots not often seen in the MCU. It is one of the more unique looking installments as a result.The action scenes are all pretty wild stuff. There are even a few moments that play out like an '80s supernatural horror movie instead of this big tentpole blockbuster. I really did appreciate that. There is a middle-act sequence that does play out like an extended cameo for a lot of actors (who I will not name as a courtesy) and it's easily a highlight of the film.Sam Raimi did a great job with this sequel and I hope whatever follow-up starring Doctor Strange as the lead character takes similar chances.",2,4,politicidal,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur57075719/?ref_=tturv_usr_566_t,20-Sep-22,8,/10,

It's amazing what a fat paycheck can get anyone to do, and in this case, it changed Raimi's mind. Too bad, for the audience.Just like Spider-Man 3, this movie also is burdened with a lot of melodrama, and just like Spider-Man 3, there is an antagonist/villain who, at the end, needs just a little nudge to do the right thing, and bam, they are redeemed. May be Raimi attempts to show that there's good in all of us, but that premise is so naive, wrongly simplistic, and has been done to death since the inception of cinema, that he just ends up producing another snore fest. As an iconic movie character said ""some men just want to watch the world burn"", there isn't always a good side to them waiting to come out with the adequate amount of tears.The movie is a little over two hours long, and by the time an hour had passed, I was so bored that I started checking social media on my phone (there were no one seating in the rows behind me).

I really don't know why, possibly because of the poor writing and worst dialogue. Also, emotional display without connection to the viewer ultimately led to failure.Special effects and action were decent but nothing mind blowing, some intense and sort of scary scenes were forced upon us in an attempt to create a special atmosphere but failed as well, perhaps for the 7 to 9 years old viewers it might work.Such a let down, to those people who live in a country which banned the movie, don't sweat about it, you're not missing anything special, in fact you're lucky as this to me is the worst Marvel Movie I've seen in a while.Who knows, this whole banning story could b a desperate marketing attempt as well.I think Disney just blew it, it feels like a kid's movie, probably ages 7 to 13 would enjoy this, but not for the mature and intelligent audience.I think I'm done with Marvel and Superhero movies, it's becoming over saturated.",77,90,med77_99,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur3511390/?ref_=tturv_usr_577_t,6-May-22,1,/10,

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8486908/?ref_=tturv_perm_587,"""Face Your Fears, Doctor Strange.""","The MCU is getting mighty unwieldy. Doctor Strange 2 is the twenty-seventh film in Marvel's expansive franchise, and the fabric of the universe is starting to stretch uncomfortably thin. Throughout phase 4, Marvel has made two bold assumptions; one, that audiences continue to relate to their characters, despite the fact they've been reduced to shallow, grating quip machines, and two, that mass audiences can be persuaded to watch supplemental material to understand what the hell is happening in the filmic universe. In this case, Wanda Vision, a Disney+ show, is recommended viewing. Many of Marvel's most devoted fans will be happy to consume, but average moviegoers may feel differently. Time will tell.The film follows Doctor Strange as he fights Wanda Maximoff, who seeks to abduct America Chavez in order to teleport to a universe where Wanda's children are still alive. Throughout the journey, Strange learns the valuable lesson of letting go and trusting those around him or something along those lines.Doctor Strange 2 is one of the worst films of the MCU thus far, for a myriad of reasons. The first and most obvious, is that any joy, wonder, novelty, or excitement relating to superheroes has long since been extinguished. Doctor Strange's parallel realities are no reality at all, in cinematic terms. Every element is flat, fake, and leaden, slavishly subvariant to digital wizardry and totally unconcerned with any human interest. The MCU is fast approaching Star Wars prequel levels of anti-verisimilitude, a disturbing proposition.Good superhero films are still being made, but the promise of grounding their action or substance in any sort of reality, a principle early films like Iron Man and the Dark Knight trilogy staunchly adhered to, is totally ignored. This is wistful sentiment, and I apologize for the overwrought remembrance, but Doctor Strange 2 has put me in a mood of longing. It's always fascinating to see how splendid even the rustiest junk looks after looking upon something covered in sickening slime.The visual landscape is not the only ungrounded element. The story and dialogue are preposterous and maddeningly contrived; heroes run around with little plan or purpose and seem laughably incompetent while doing so. Our villain, who is a purportedly all-powerful being capable of slaughtering legions en masse, can't manage to hold onto a teenage girl for more than a minute. And, as mentioned, her emotional stakes and arc can't be fully comprehended without supplemental material, which is A++ storytelling. Secondary characters, ostensibly capable, wise, and vigilant, are also arrogant enough to wave away the threat of what they know to be extremely powerful and ancient evil.Perhaps the most disappointing feature of Doctor Strange 2 is the involvement of Sam Raimi. To be fair, it's difficult for even the most seasoned, stylistic directors to make their mark on MCU films. Because these films are made on an assembly line, the only practical method for directors to stamp their style is to slip a piece of flair on one belt here, drop a subtle hint of creativity on another belt there, carefully move around the factory, and augment the product in a manner unnoticeable to the floor manager.Raimi does exactly this, slipping in a semblance of his style over the course of Doctor Strange 2 while staying far out focus. The craftsmanship and attention to detail of the film is a far cry from Raimi's original Spider-Man trilogy, which is a great shame considering he was instrumental in introducing Marvel to mainstream audiences, when the MCU was just a glimmer in Kevin Feige's eye. To see just how bland filmmaking has become since the not-exactly-stellar period of the early aughts is disheartening.The film is terrible, but the cast does a commendable job of playing the material with a straight face. Cumberbatch, McAdams, Olsen, and Wong look adequately invested in the nonsensical mayhem surrounding them. There are some interesting cameos as well, cleverly cast and hinting at future MCU properties in a not-totally-whorish way. The lowlight of the cast is Xochitl Gomez, who can't quite pull off a punky, rebellious presence fighting to hold back deeper tragedy. Her unconvincing performance can be forgiven, considering she's surrounded by A-list talent and acting predominantly against green backdrops.Altogether, Doctor Strange 2 is a miserable time at the theater. It's among the worst of the MCU's twenty-seven film lineup, firmly better than only Thor 2 and Eternals. It's a chaotic mess of loud, dumb action, baffling character decisions and motivations, and emotional stakes which can only be properly understood by watching a show on Disney+.

In fact the action is now boring, characters waving their hands around as things happen, the mandatory set piece has become a monotonous chore.",1,1,yavoyavo,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur61131665/?ref_=tturv_usr_588_t,13-Sep-22,1,/10,

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8122807/?ref_=tturv_perm_598,Marvel has made a HORROR MOVIE!!!,"Don't go with expectations of watching a superhero movie, ""anyatha aapka kat jayega"". FYI, It is an old cheap horror movie. But you will enjoy. Mainly because it has many and enough Intresting Scenes to keep you hooked to screen. Also, PLEASE WATCH ONLY IN 3D, OR IF POSSIBLE IMAX 3D. And AVOID watching in 2D version, I don't think anyone can enjoy this movie in 2D. In 2D, it will be great suffering to pass 3 hours. Don't risk your life. Please, remember I am giving 8 stars for only 3D, Horror and hot & scary Elizabeth Olsen. IT'S 3D IS NEXT LEVEL, Don't miss it. So far only Doctor Strange-1 and Infinity War were only 2 movies in MCU movies which came close to this level. Nothing Intresting about plot or acting. Wanda is a completely changed character and is playing the role of antagonist. But nothing new in story, please go and watch to enjoy horror and NEXT LEVEL 3D.",2,3,Vineet_MishraPrayagraj_Dibiyapur,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur78172630/?ref_=tturv_usr_598_t,7-May-22,8,/10,

For some odd reason, Act 3 felt like the Marvel I would have wanted while Acts 1 and 2 came off as literal PG-13 fun...like Spy Kids... This isn't to say it's a bad thing, but it is something I think I'm personally going to have to make myself accept with this new Marvel.Additionally, I do feel that an America Disney series should've been released prior to this film...maybe instead of dropping the Hawkeye or Falcon and Winter Soldier series...SN: Stay for the first post credit, you don't need to watch the second.OTHER THOUGHTSHighlights: The visual effects and cinematography, the storyline for the Scarlett Witch, Act 3, thematic followthrough, pacing, and subtle LGBTQ+ representation.What Could've Been Better: America's storyline/overall existence as a character was my main qualm with the film.",2,5,Popcorn-And-Twizzlers,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur141983543/?ref_=tturv_usr_599_t,15-May-22,9,/10,
https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8122577/?ref_=tturv_perm_600,A refreshing change in tone.,Sam Raimi has his fingers in a lot of this movie and that made this so refreshing. Horror and violence is introduced here and is unlike anything you've seen before in MCU. There are maybe one too many characters to balance that end up taking away from Doctor Strange's character arc. Very enjoyable and I hope Sam Raimi is here to stay.,2,2,Camerenth,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur24362910/?ref_=tturv_usr_600_t,7-May-22,8,/10,
