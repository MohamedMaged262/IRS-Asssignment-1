I loved the recall of old villains, it was great to see Foxx, Molina and Dafoe come back again and it's clear they're having fun. Cumberbatch is good in a limited role too. Best of all are Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire, who light up the screen and make all of their scenes delightful; they show up Holland, that's for sure. The rest is your usual mish mash of CGI action complete with an excruciatingly overblown and sentimental ending (please!)."

I actually flew to London to see him in Hamlet. I also saw him in New York City in Letters Live.Possibly for monetary reasons or childhood fantasy, Cumberbatch was dying to be part of a franchise.Well, as usual, he was superb. But I have to be the only one who sought out this film just to see him!I don't know the thread of any of these Marvel stories. The characters are certainly likeable, and the effects spectacular.I got a kick out of Cumberbatch making profound gestures with his hands and working in front of a green screen.

It's the jumping off point for Marvel movies to do what they do best, and No Way Home doesn't disappoint, thanks to that tried and true formula of good-natured banter and giddy CGI set pieces. I liked how it taps into Electro's awesome power. I kind of imagined that Electro, played by Jamie Foxx, perhaps, and this is a big perhaps, could be a crime-fighting consultant in some future movie. And Willem Dafoe gave a tortured performance as Norman Osborn, fighting hard to silence the diabolical inner voice of Green Goblin.All Marvel pictures have non-preachy messaging. No Way Home touches on grief, vengeance, and also makes a case for humanity's redemptive nature."

The storyline follows post Civil War activities when the world discovers Peter Parker is Spider-Man. He approaches Dr. Strange about removing people's memories of him but while Strange is casting the spell Parker interrupts him causing Strange to make a mistake and open a vortex to multiple universes letting in Spider-Man villains from other universes. Can Spider-Man catch the villains and send them back?This movie is directed by Jon Watts (Spider-Man: Homecoming) and stars Tom Holland (The Devil All the Time) , Zendaya (Dune), Benedict Cumberbatch (Star Trek: Into the Darkness), Willem Dafoe (Platoon), Jamie Foxx (Ray), Alfred Molina (Boogie Nights) and Marisa Tomei (My Cousin Vinny).The special effects in this are out of this world as you'd expect from a Marvel movie. The storyline is clever, unpredictable and just the right level of complex with plenty of surprises sprinkled in throughout. The dynamics of the characters are very well presented and the ending is clever and well done and closes the trilogy perfectly. Defoe delivers an incredible performance and this is easily my favorite presentation of Green Goblin yet. All the villains are well done, to be honest. The cast overall does a fantastic job in this picture. This also does a great job of weaving in the holistic Marvel universe characters and themes throughout including an excellent after credits scene.Overall this has an Avengers style grandiose epic feel to it. This and Into the Spider-Verse are the two best Spider-Man movies by far. I would score this a 10/10 and strongly recommend it."

The cast was great though, Tom Holland, Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield together that is great for Spider-Man fans, but also many great names playing the villains. The budget was 200 millions and that shows in the great CGI's.

Sailing past $1 billion dollars at the box-office (the first film post pandemic to do so), the picture not only broke the bank, it also broke the internet. Indeed, anyone who hasn't been living under a rock for the past year probably already knows more about the highly secretive plot than they'd like to; even those who've stayed off the internet altogether are likely to have their efforts squandered at the last second, especially if they decide to rent/ purchase the movie from the Apple store (beware major spoilers on the film's own page). Don't worry, though, I don't intend to spoil anything here... at least, not yet. As such, I'm going to keep things as vague as possible.Coming in at 148 minutes, the film is one of the longest entries in the MCU. Despite everything it aims to cram into its admittedly somewhat bloated runtime, it somehow manages to be shorter than 'Eternals (2021)'. Thankfully, it's also a lot more propulsive and, crucially, fun. It moves at a real clip, dropping you straight into its action after briefly catching you up on the cliffhanger ending of 'Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019)'. Much of the first act plays out in pseudo-montage, skimming over large chunks of time but still managing to hammer home the consequences of the previous movie's shocking climax. It's immediately darker in tone than either of its fairly light predecessors, something which only grows more apparent as the piece moves into its own finale, but it still has a high-school heart and maintains the series' signature sense of humour. It balances its tone well throughout, effortlessly bouncing between moments that tickle your ribs and moments that tug at your heartstrings without ever feeling as though it undermines itself. That's a difficult thing to do.The feature remains remarkably focused on character considering its sheer amount of spectacle; it makes sure that all of its elements, no matter how extraneous they may be, feel as though they shape Spider-Man and his allies. It's easy to look at the film, which is undeniably part of a money-making franchise and very likely originated as a studio mandate rather than a filmmaker's inspired idea, and see nothing other than corporate cynicism. However, it genuinely feels as though it has been made by people who care. They clearly have reverence for the source material, crafting characters that feel very true to who they're supposed to be, and they also have reverence for the fans - in fact, they seem to be fans themselves. Even if they started from a studio-dictated endpoint designed to get bums in seats, they managed to work backwards and make something that doesn't feel lazy or like a cash grab. Instead, it feels like a celebration of its characters, as well as an ambitious attempt to do something that isn't quite like anything else out there. It's also just incredibly fun. At the end of the day, that's what really matters.A lot of the feature is comprised of blatant fan service and it occasionally (though only occasionally) crosses the line into corporate cringe, but I'd be lying if I said that even some of the most banal references didn't make me smile. It's not as if its nostalgia bait is separate from its story, either; in fact, it's intrinsically tied to it. This means that even its fan service is consequential to its narrative, used to actually the build core pillars of its story rather than simply decorate them. Most of its surprises are handled really well, with a majority of them resulting in tangible repercussions and rising above their potentially one-shot nature. Nothing here truly feels like a gimmick. That's all I can really say about this aspect without spoiling things too much.Some of the plot doesn't quite make sense, and you're likely to be scratching your head about certain high-concept ideas even after the credits have rolled. It's not as if there's anything all that thematically or conceptually complex going on, it's just that the affair sort of hand-waves its way through some fairly major aspects of its story. It also explains a few of those aspects in ways that eventually contrast with how they actually play out (again, I'm being as vague as possible to avoid spoilers). Though a number of character decisions are ever-so-slightly questionable, they are always the result of fallible individuals whose choices actively shape their personality; as such, they aren't at all bothersome. What is bothersome, though, is that some of the flick's own internal logic simply doesn't line up. It isn't totally detrimental, but it definitely makes the thing feel a bit more rough around the edges than it ought to. This is also frustratingly close to not even being an issue, as one or two rewritten lines would solve almost all of the noticeable flaws (at least when it comes to what you may call 'plot holes'). Still, it's impressive that the picture manages to do everything that it does (which is quite a lot) without feeling overly dense or plodding. I'd much rather have an inconsistent blast than an air-tight bore. Plus, the picture almost asks you not to think about the ins and outs of its plot too much; I think that's a fair thing to ask when it provides this much entertainment.It's not as if it's brainless, either. It has a fairly strong, relatively distinct thematic underpinning and its central conflict is interesting in that it's born not from an insidious intervention, but from a character's bold decision to try to do the right thing (once more, that's all I'll say to avoid spoiling things). The movie also has a handful of affecting moments, emerging as a much more emotionally mature and resonant affair than most of its peers. This is compounded by, for my money, some of the best performances in the MCU. Holland is surprisingly good here, capable of selling the emotion as well as the banter, and some of the other core players (who shall remain nameless) definitely earn their paychecks, too. However, a couple of its characters are underserved (one, in particular, is practically robbed) and the story does occasionally struggle to balance its elements in a way that makes them all seem as though they have equal - or, I suppose, proportional - weight.The film looks really good considering that most of it was filmed in that magical land known as the blue screen studio (and some of it seems to have been shot in a shoe cupboard), with its CGI environments often being indistinguishable from its real sets. Of course, its digital elements also sometimes fall a bit flat. This doesn't bother me massively, primarily because even the least practical sequences are still gripping, but I can't deny I would have preferred to see a few more real-life locations. The action set-pieces are all fantastic and, often, surprisingly brutal. The picture maintains a good balance between web-slinging fantasy and hand-to-hand fisticuffs, all while keeping its action grounded and believable. These are some of the best sequences of their kind in the entire MCU. They're consequential, tense, exciting and immensely entertaining.Ultimately, that's the best way to describe the overall film: immensely entertaining. It's just an absolute riot. It has its issues, of course, but none of them really take away from how fun it is. Just because it probably started as a lazy studio mandate meant to milk money from a content-hungry fanbase doesn't mean it can't rise above its half-hearted origins (thanks to the creative team involved) to become an ambitious and effective crowd-pleaser. Films have pretty much always been made primarily to make money, but that doesn't mean they don't have any non-monetary value. Like many of its contemporaries, this may not be arthouse, but that doesn't mean it isn't art. It's perhaps one of the best pictures of its kind.--SPOILERS--I was going to break down a few elements of the film in more detail here, but (at least for now) I'm all talked out. Besides, I feel as though I managed to talk about the picture fairly comprehensively without spoiling anything major (hopefully it isn't too vague). Instead, I have decided just to highlight what's possibly my favourite moment in the entire movie:Spider-Man pins Green Goblin to a wall with his knees and begins hitting him in the face with elbow after elbow. With each strike, the Goblin's gleeful eyes light up more and an insidious smile stretches further across his face. Then, he erupts into his iconic cackle and turns the tables on his attacker.That right there is the stuff dreams are made of."

I would attribute this to a number of factors, firstly and most importantly the storyline is a lot more adult than in the two previous movies. Secondly I dug the presence of Benedict Cumberbatch's Doctor Strange character, having recently watched and enjoyed the two movies bearing his name above the title (this crossover stuff is all a bit tricky sometimes!). Thirdly and best of all were the surprise appearances of both previous Spider-Men, Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield. I love all that multi-verse time and space stuff and even while I recognised it straight away as a plot -device that had been used more than once in the ""Doctor Who"" BBC TV series, it was nevertheless really neat to see it employed here not only with the past versions of old Spidey himself but also the attendant villains from those earlier movies, like the Green Goblin, Dr Octopus, Electro, The Lizard and Sandman. The interaction between the three Spider-Men as well as their nemeses, while occasionally clunky and clichéd, was, on the whole, quite funny and entertaining, I thought. And as a big fan of the Marvel ""DaredTV series, I really appreciated Charlie Cox's cameo as Matt Murdock.I especially liked the interlude with Doctor Strange as I'm a sucker for all the psychedelic collapsing-time effects, although that was offset by the numerous scenes aimed no doubt at placating the teenage audience at which I would imagine the movie was primarily aimed.The group battle-royal at the end went on a bit too long, as per and at one point it seemed as if Spidey One had met his end but I guess the producers felt that one death in the family was enough. It was cool to see Messrs Maguire and Garfield back and suited up again, for obvious reasons without their masks, especially when you consider that both their shares in the franchise were originally outside the MCU.All in all, this was a very inventive and pleasing wrap-up of Spider Man versions 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0. Now that young Holland has made his third movie as your friendly neighbourhood web-slinger, one wonders now where the character will go next and indeed who will be playing him."

I liked the acting, the little gems, the sheer hubris of the story. However, it was for all intents and purposes, a universe consolidation move (before they break it all again in Multiverse of Madness). It's one of those reset stories, but one that manages to unite previous resets, which makes it the resettiest of them all. It is there to basically answer all the comic geek questions about how could so many films and reboots and stories exist in the same MCU and open the door to the future.There were no real new characters, some were explained away, some where killed off and new concepts of the incoming threats hinted at. One end-credits scene winked towards a Venom recrossing, while the second was basically a trailer for the next Doctor Strange film, not a ""scene"".So there is a difference between the typical Marvel cinematic universe film and this one: the villain(s) are weak and unfocused while the plot, however entertaining, just a background to the goal of the film: to stabilize the canon and prepare for the new Doctor Strange movie. This does mean the Strangeverse will grow and possibly be amazingly fun, but also that I don't see the Avengers going anywhere for a long while, except maybe TV series.In conclusion: for the fans of the Marvel stories and the faithful viewers of movies and series in that universe, this is a big nice bonus, a step on a promising ladder of new content. However as a standalone film it has limited value. It is a good film, and probably a necessary one, but its storytelling will not blow your mind in any way."

Marisa Tomei and John Favreau are also great in the usual roles.Like the previous MCU Spider-Man films, the comedy is excellent, with lots of funny situations, humorous banter and site gags.I enjoyed some of themes explored by the writers around immigration and the divisive role of the media. JK Simmons' reimagined character from the Sam Raimi trilogy is worked nicely into these ideas. Importantly there was quite a refreshingly positive tone with the non-lethal intentions of the heroes towards the villains and this for me is what sets it apart from so many other action-adventure movies.As ever with Marvel, the visuals and spectacle is technically fantastic and dominates certain sequences.

Could it possibly live up to that gargantuan level of anticipation? Do you know, I think it just about does.With his secret identity revealed to the world, and accused of murder, Peter Parker (Tom Holland) asks Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) to cast a spell to make everyone in the world forget who he is. When the spell is interrupted several new villains appear in New York, each confused as to where they are, but with a focus on revenge against Spider-man. As the rifts in the multiverse worsen, Strange arrives at a plan to close the breaches but the cost is too much for Parker, who desperately searches for another way.I've been watching Marvel films for a long time, before the MCU was even a glint in Kevin Feige's eye, so it's perhaps understanding that I found this to be one of the most emotional films that the series has ever produced. Seeing Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina, Jamie Foxx, Rhys Ifans and Thomas Hayden Church return as their respective characters was pretty affecting, particularly with the way this film continues the character arcs for some of them. To say that all of the performances, effects and cinematography was excellent is an understatement, but also is standard of the work that Marvel and Sony usually provide.What's not always so spot on is the story. Here though, it's the movies key strength. The objectives are kept relatively straight forward, so it makes a film that has so many characters and plot points in it, is easy to keep up with. There are a few highly emotional moments, both obvious and more subtle and I'm not sure I've ever been with a live audience and heard them audible gasp as loudly as they did at one point in the film.Last word. Can I just say a well done to Jon Watts. Sony and Marvel, Pascal and Feige usually land most of the plaudits - but he's brought in a trilogy of three great Spiderman films, in five years, and with a global pandemic hampering one of them. Absolutely can't wait for his ""Fantastic four"" film."

The charm of having a smaller scale story is missed a little, but at the same time, the ambition and scale does still work pretty well, making for a fun and fast-paced two and a half hours.I can see some people criticising this for being too crowd-pleasing, as there is a lot of fan service, references, and moments that seem designed to get crowds cheering. I didn't feel like it was too cynical. The core of the film - its premise, pacing, acting, action etc - are all solid, so throwing in the crowd pleasing stuff felt mostly earned to me, even it almost crosses the line into becoming ridiculous.There are a few plot things that feel a little rushed and like they don't make complete sense. Maybe they do and the breakneck pacing doesn't always allow things to be entirely clear, I don't know. It means this film could either get quite a bit better or quite a bit worse with a second viewing, but after just one, I'm satisfied. I had a good time watching this, and the crowd did, too.Marvel's had two hits and two misses this year, when it comes to films, in my opinion. I like Eternals and Black Widow less the more I think about them, but got a lot of enjoyment out of both this and Shang-Chi.

(Much like what they said about the 16 before it.) Nope. I sat from almost the first 10 minutes LOVING this movie and debating if this actually beat out the magnificent 2002's Spider-Man and its even better follow-up, 2004's Spider-Man 2.I will say this: This is my new 2nd favorite of ALL 27 MCU movies. Easy. And it's easily in the top three of the 10 theatrical-released Spider-Man movies. In fact, since part 2 in 2004, I have not been impressed with any of the Spider-Man movies until Spider-Man into the Spider-Verse and this third Tom Holland-led Spider-Man series.I barely liked Tom's Spider-Man: Homecoming and I refer to it Iron Man Jr because it was WAY more about Iron Man smarts and involvement and it clearly made Peter a complete moron who couldn't lift a finger or figure out anything on his own without big-daddy Tony helping. Tom's Spider-Man: Far From Home was better, but it still couldn't let go of Tony (EVEN after his character supposedly left the franchise.) This second rebooted version of Spider-Man of Tom Holland's made me sad, because of how dumb Peter is and how reliant he is on others, namely big-daddy Tony. This is NOT the brilliant Peter Parker I grew up with.But, FINALLY...they got it right with Tom's third movie. The trailer spoiled SO MUCH of this movie and the actors involved, as trailers are designed to be spoiler packed (usually the very last scene of the movie is in the trailer,) so I won't even go into the synopsis or what happens or who's in it. I just HIGHLY encourage you to see this ASAP and know: they FINALLY got Spider-Man right. After 5 disappointing follow-ups to Spider-Man 2, THEY FINALLY GOT SPIDER-MAN BACK ON TRACK.I laughed so hard, even though it wasn't like the traditional MCU movie where it's mostly a comedy. These were genuine jokes and not just inserted to please the audience who apparently wants more comedic MCU movies than action-packed Super-Hero movies. I cried a bit, even though it's mostly an uplifting movie. And yes, I marveled on how well acted and written this film is. Everybody gave it their 110% and no one stole scenes or out-performed anyone else. This was MY Endgame event.I loved this movie so much, I probably will buy it right away on Blu upon release. And to give you a hint of how much that is to me: I don't really buy Blurays anymore due to the convenience of streaming and of ALL 27 MCU movies, I only bought two so far. The rest, I can watch online if I feel like it. Most are forgettable, anyways.I heard they're building a new trilogy with Tom Holland continuing his role as Spidey. To be frank, before this viewing, I almost didn't want to see them. If this turned out just slightly better than Tom's 2nd one which was just slightly better than his mediocre 1st one, I was pretty much done.Now, my Spidey-Sense is tingling to see what they have in store for us next."

And then, in a weird tonal shift, the movie gets really dark, and then tries to go back to the light-hearted bit with that hanging over it, and does some more really silly stuff, and some rather confused but fast-paced action, and then goes for a sad thing that I found kinda boring, and, well, what is this supposed to *be*.It doesn't make much sense, it's tonally chaotic, and as with the previous film, the action is fleetfully enjoyable but entirely forgettable.Still, a reasonable amount of the humor works, it's fun to see the way they play with the multiverse, and there's definitely fun to be had.

The dialogues & interactions are cringey, the technical execution is bland for the most part, camerawork is meh, editing during the action sequences is awful, visual effects are poor for a $200 million blockbuster and Michael Giacchino's score is also serviceable at best.Overall, Spider-Man: No Way Home gives the old & new fans exactly what they came looking for and makes for a thoroughly enjoyable & entertaining extravaganza that will please most viewers if not all. There are some emotionally resonant moments that definitely stand out & elevate the ride but there was also room for plenty of improvement in several areas.

The interpretations of Tom Holland who played as Peter Parker / Spider-Man, Alfred Molina who played as Dr. Otto Octavius / Doc Ock, Benedict Cumberbatch who played as Doctor Strange and Willem Dafoe who played as Norman Osborn / Green Goblin were simply fantastic and their combination worked very well and created an outstanding result.

I suspect that script, like the unbearably plucky characters, are targeting the 'tween crowd, but I found the 'humour' to be painfully juvenile, especially the antics of Parker's friend Ned (Jacob Batalon), which were tiresome from the moment he appeared on screen. The central premise (about which, to avoid spoilers, I won't elaborate) is interesting at a number of levels but the movie is far too long for the story it tells (the script writer seems to have been paid by the word). I also found the abrupt jumps between pathos and levity jarring (cry for the tragic death of a major character then cut to further Ned/MJ buffoonery).

Literally nothing is holding this film back which the script contains about everything. And director Jon Watts making the best spider man movie ever. Fans and non fans are going to love the film. The story is best to go without any spoilers. There are many surprises that will leave the crowd cheering. Story also goes into an emotional direction and making the film feeling like a conclusion to the trilogy. Characters story arcs coming to an end. While opening up more possibilities to where the direction can go.No Way Home does the third film of concluding the story right unlike Amazing Spider man movie or the original third film where they cram up so many villains and a story that can barely hold it together. No Way Home script managed to balance the story and characters out. This film does have several villains. A lot of returning villains that is a lot of fun surprises and even with a new look. Peter Parker facing each one of them and trying to stop them is awesome. The plot is great. It can try to go in a emotional direction. There is also a fun brief appearance of another character which is cool to see and hoping to see more of them in future mcu films someday.The action sequences are awesome and stylistic. Spider man fight scenes are amazing. The visual effects are brilliant. The cinematography is well done in capturing the action scenes. The music score is different by Michael Giacchino but great. The cast ensemble did a great job. Like I said earlier, the appearances making a return is a lot of fun. For a long run time, the film does feel short and very fast moving which keeps your eyes glued to the screen.The climax battle is epic and exciting. Spider Man facing multiple villains is one of the best action scenes ever. It can be a bit dark. The action scene with Spider Man and Doctor Strange chasing each other through the mirror dimension is stunning.Overall, No Way Home is one of the best Marvel films ever. And one of the best Spider man movies. It is big, epic, and the script and direction had a lot of surprises. I am hoping to see Jon Watts take on another Marvel project.There is a fun mid credit scene that hints for where the direction can go. And a post credit scene that hints of where mcu is going next."

Desperate to undo the damage inflicted on his loved ones, Peter consults with Sorcerer Supreme Dr. Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) who begins casting a spell to make the world forget Peter Parker is Spider-Man, but interference by Peter leaves the spell corrupted and several villains from alternate universes including Otto Octavius/Doctor Octopus (Alfred Molina), Norman Osborn/Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe), Flint Marko/Sandman (Thomas Haden Church), and Max Dillon/Electro (Jamie Foxx) that Peter must contend with to prevent the collapse of the multiverse.Spider-Man: No Way Home is the third and final entry in the MCU ""Home"" trilogy of Spider-Man films that began with Homecoming and continued with Far From Home. Despite both films being well-received and major grossers, there was doubt the movie would even happen due to disagreements between Disney and Sony where Disney wanted as much as 50% of the box office grosses of Spider-Man films which with Spider-Man being a keystone franchise for Sony was unacceptable causing negotiations to break down, but thanks to lobbying from both fans and especially Tom Holland the two companies were able to renew discussions with Disney fronting 25% of the budget in exchange for 25% of the gross as well as merchandising rights surrounding Spider-Man. With an ambitious premise and some real weighty and emotional stakes, Spider-Man: No Way Home gives us an emotionally resonant end to the trilogy.I think I should preface this by saying I've never really been all that impressed with the prior standalone MCU Spider-Man movies despite having enjoyed Tom Holland in the titular role. With Homecoming I thought it was okay if maybe a little too light and overly jokey and with Far From Home I thought it was a bit of a mess from both a character and story perspective and it's probably one of the lesser entries in the MCU. I think a big reason behind what doesn't make solo Spider-Man films work is the fact the character from his introduction was heavily ingrained not just with the Avengers, but also with Tony Stark down to having him prominently use Stark tech and gadgets in his suit that made him feel less like Peter Parker the everyman and more like Iron Man's protégé. If you look at Holland's role in the MCU, all the most dramatic and emotionally resonant moments have taken place inside ensemble efforts like his introduction in Captain America: Civil War or Avengers: Infinity War and it's because from the outset there was a greater focus on how they could include Spider-Man as one of the Avengers rather than having him stand apart. With No Way Home it does feel like there's an attempt to address that by uncoupling him from Tony Stark and giving more personal stakes and despite not liking the events that lead to the set-up for this story, it finally gives this version of Peter something approaching what we saw in the first two Raimi films or even the first Webb film.The fact that we're given an assortment of the most Memorable villains from Spider-Man's entire cinematic past is nothing short of extraordinary, not only because this would've been unthinkable in prior years but also because the actors reprising their roles haven't lost a beat with Alfred Molina and Willem Dafoe still fitting effortlessly back into these roles of Dr. Octopus and Green Goblin respectively as though they never left and even Jamie Foxx as Electro gets to be much better here than he was in Amazing Spider-Man 2. Rhys Ifans and Thomas Haden Church are okay as Lizard and Sandman, but the fact they don't have much of a physical presence in the movie does lead to them not being as engaging as the other presences. We also get some good scenes between Peter and Benedict Cumberbatch's Doctor Strange who in keeping with the themes of the ""home"" trilogy does serve as a mentor figure for Peter. Zendaya is once again really good as Peter's girlfriend MJ and Marisa Tomei gets some more weighty dramatic scenes between her and Peter after having largely been a comic presence. But by far, the worst kept secret ever, is the return of Andrew Garfield ad Tobey Maguire as variations of Spider-Man is the most welcome surprise. Jon Watts is clearly aware of what an opportunity this is and when those two are reintroduced the movie allows itself to slow down and simply take time to have the characters talk with each other so we can appreciate just how unprecedented an opportunity this is. Tobey Maguire is really good playing a more seasoned Spider-Man and Andrew Garfield who's tenure as the character was cut short is given resolution and several threads from Amazing Spider-Man 2 that round out his character.I thin invariably No Way Home will invite comparisons to Into the Spider-Verse, and despite the surface level overlap that's pretty much where the similarities begin and end. Into the Spider-Verse I maintain is the best Spider-Man movie we've gotten thus far and while it did have visual references to prior films it largely stood on its own making up new continuities for its various Spider-people (and animals). No Way Home on the other hand is more of a culmination of several films with the prior Spider-Man Home entries, Raimi trilogy, the Amazing films, Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame, and Doctor Strange all required viewing to get the full effect of the film, so this is not a movie that stands by itself. The movie will also invite some comparisons to rather divisive (to put it minimally) Spider-Man stories like One More Day and One Moment in Time, but don't let that dissuade you. Despite being a rather extreme answer of what to do with Spider-Man, it at least does feel more earned and emotionally resonant, especially since it's not tied to nonsensical events in Mark Millar's Civil War miniseries.Spider-Man: No Way Home is an ambitious film that finally gives Holland a standalone entry that allows him to be the most dramatically resonant he's been allowed to be in any of these ""Home"" films and creates a story that has elevated personal stakes for the character. While the dense build-up to the film that requires viewing of several films doesn't make No Way Home as accessible as the similarly themed Into the Spider-Verse and the ending will leave some divided, it's definitely the best entry we've seen for the MCU Spider-Man."

A stunning achievement in pushing forward while also acknowledging the past, things here might not be perfect but there's too much to like here to deny that Marvel has once more raised the bar for the comic book cinematic landscape.4 imprisoned trees out of 5Check out my film blog Jordan and Eddie for more reviews!"

It's got a lot of similarities to that.By doing that, Disney were able to do here what J. J. Abrams was very clever in doing with his reboot of 'Star Trek' (2009). This will now give them a free reign to continue with any ideas that they might have for any of the Spider-Man's or with the ""Spider-Verse"", which is great for the fans.How they do it is brilliant, if a tiny bit slow to start with. I would have liked them to have brought in the other universe characters a bit sooner, especially the allies and I think that they should have brought back the second ally first, but I suppose that's what we were expecting.Once all of the characters are in play though it is a high octane film full of the usual wit and joy that only Spidey can bring.Moving the pace forward could have given them a bit more time at the end of the film to really drive the action and allow more coverage of the people that turned up late, but regardless of that, it's definitely my favourite of Tom's three films so far.It's not a stand alone film as it literally follows on from 'Spider-Man: Far From Home' (2019) and obviously has references to 'Avengers: Infinity War/Endgame' (2018/19) too.I would suggest that you re-watch the other five (Tobey and Andrew) films or at least refresh your memory on them before viewing this one as I don't actually remember enough of 'The Amazing Spider-Man/2' (2012/14), because I thought that they were terrible and so was Andrew Garfield. He was not what I would call my version of the famous spider guy, so I've only seen them once. Give me Tom or Tobey any time (I've recently watched them again and feel that Andrew was given bad scripts, but actually delivered the character quite appropriately, I think that I was just bitter because I loved Tobey so much and didn't think that he needed replacing).As a result a lot of the references to Andrew's films were lost on me and any characters that might have been in those films were not easy to recall. I actually questioned if they had been added just to fill out this films cast, they were so forgettable.They do perhaps bring back too many bad guys too?What I really do love though is the fact that J. Jonah Jamieson has been the same in every universe. J. K. Simmons really seems to fit the character perfectly for me and it's good to see him used in a way that shows that some things are a constant and can't be changed. (He probably is Spidey in one of the original comic book ""Verses"", just to prove my theory wrong, but I haven't read enough of them to know.) I'm not sure Ned's wig was the right shade or style though.On another note, Mr Holland is simply a superb actor. Just when I feel like I'm going off of him, I see him on screen and think ""Wow, what a great performance!"" He turns anything he touches to gold. Even in his first film, 'The Impossible' (2012) as a very young lad, he gives his best, as a wonderfully emotive character, which he still brings here. I see a bright future for him.I am glad that Doctor Strange wasn't used too much in this story, as I was worried that he might have easily taken over, but this film is definitely all about Spider-Man.I also loved the fact that they brought back such memorable characters from the ""Tobey Universe"" - Doc Ock and The Green Goblin. I've always loved Mr Maguire and his Spider-Man incarnation. For me, the original three films, well let's say two actually, were more recognisable as what I personally understand of Spidey, but the current form with Tom is just very clever in moving it forward and bringing it up to date. His physical form is nice too (What? He's like 25 or something? That's legal!).The end credits scene is just a trailer full of spoilers for the next Dr Strange, so don't waste your time after the mid credits scene.I can't wait to see how they move it on now, with so much potential and this wonderful actor.902.22/1000."

I'm also a genuine admirer of Marvel and the content they produce. I have followed the entirety of their Cinematic Universe (Including the standalone shows) doing that subsequently, I had always wanted nothing but what's best for them. But that doesn't necessarily oblige me to give favourable feedback nor does it compel me to abstain from constructive criticisms; as a film analyst, it's my duty to convey my feelings with utmost honesty, and I will do just that.No Way Home is far off from the superiority I was being foretold. The film heavily banks upon the valuable memories and the attachments people have with this franchise or the character of Spider-Man in general. I'm not saying I didn't enjoy the ride, matter of fact I did. To get all the different variations of Spider-Man in a single frame, was a brilliant decision coming from the makers' side. To see Toby Maguire, Andrew Garfield and Tom Holland partaking in combats against the bad guys and having some laughs and fun while doing it; well, it was a sight to behold, an invaluable moment for the fans to cherish.And that's what this film stands for right? It's a fan service more than anything else. Catered towards the demands and desires of the franchise's fanbase. However, if you don't consider yourself a fanatic and don't bother putting all these nostalgic elements on the side, then you've got a script, that I'm afraid doesn't even qualify to be evaluated as a great piece of writing (Considering Marvel's usual standards).The screenplay isn't always high on momentum, it's very uneven with the pace. Some of the characters, the 'antagonists' in particular had little to no material to work with. Although I understand, it must have been pretty difficult to bring 'em all into a solitary feature. If it was any different production, I wouldn't have minded, but this is Marvel we are talking about. They know how to deal with a broader set of characters, don't they? This isn't something new to them, they had already done it in the past and that too in a competent manner.In the end, I do realize I'm in the minority this time but I am being completely honest in here. It's got some great action alongside a definitive emotional depth that results in a nostalgia dependant pleasure trip that I reckon would be more than enough for the plurality of the audience to fall in love with it. Can't say the same for me though. Why? Well let's just say, I made a different set of expectations in my mind."

I was intrigued to see it since I'm a fan of this comic book character. Seeing that they were going to merge him with Dr. Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) made it intriguing. I'll admit, this was spoiled for me so I knew what the gimmick here was. I actually made my wife, Jaime, watch all the Spider-Man movies from Tobey Maguire to Andrew Garfield as well so she would understand a bit more.Ahead of seeing, I tried to temper my expectations. I'll be honest, that was difficult to do. I had trouble getting into this one. I don't mind the beginning story of having Peter Parker's (Tom Holland) life turned upside down thanks to J. Jonah Jameson (J. K. Simmons) revealing that he's Spider-Man to the world. He comes up with a plan and needs the help of Dr. Strange. This make even more problems for him.Now I know it seems that I'm coming in negative. This movie is playing to the nostalgia in me and fans. Despite me struggling to get into this, I did come around. I like the characters that they bring in. I feel that is a good send off for the ones that got a bad wrap for their movies. I'm just not sure this is as strong as the other movies in the Holland line for me. I do like his taking on of Spider-Man/Peter Parker as well as Zendaya as MJ and Jacob Batalon as Ned Leeds. This goes a bit sad in the end that I wasn't expecting.I should also say that this is a CGI-fest. That is come to be expected. It still looks good. The cinematography is fine. I thought that the older characters that are brought in are good. The only one I'd go as far to say being great is Willem Dafoe. This movie knows what it is doing and I can appreciate that for sure.My Rating: 7.5 out of 10."

With Great power comes great responsibility. The entire world is about to forget about that Peter Parker is Spider-Man. Wait, everyone? Can't some people still know? That's not how the spell works.So MJ's gonna forget about everything we've ever been through. Stop tampering with the spell. No Way Home is like Peters Parkers Endgame, and 2nd chance to restart what he was accused of, and have a second chance with MJ, and Ned. No Way Home sets up mini hints for a 3rd @venommovie and a sneak preview of Doctor Strange and the Multiverse, for early showings and Premiere showings. You will walk out of the theater crying, and during the film you will feel the sadness Peter does. Spider-Man: No Way Home had heart, emotion, and the love between a son, and a mother, that bond can never be broken. On the other hand, this is the first of these three films that has allowed Zendaya and Holland's chemistry to shine. In particular, she nails the emotional final beats of her character in a way that adds weight to a film that can feel a bit airy in terms of performance. The references they had to Spider-Man (2002), Spider-Man 2 (2004), Spider-Man 3 (2007), The Amazing Spider-Man (2012), and The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014). And it playfully becomes a commentary on correcting mistakes of the past not just in the life of Holland's Parker but those of characters (and even filmmakers) made long before he stepped into the role. ""No way Home"" is about the weight of heroic decisions. Even the right ones mean you may not be able to go home again. No Way Home is the story of life, death, love, 2nd chances, and the true person you are and how pure your heart it. Go Watch Spider- Man: No Way Home in theaters tomorrow (December 17,2021)"

Starts off fun, safe and familiar and then becomes extremely emotional, satisfying and full of great callbacks. A love letter to all things Spider-Man.Tom Holland gives an incredible lead performance once again, reliably charming and likeable but with a lot more emotional heft this time around. Zendaya and Jacob Batalon both have perfect chemistry with Holland and are also incredible in their own ways.Benedict Cumberbatch reaffirms why he's such a good Doctor Strange with his excellent dry wit and gravitas. All the returning villains give strong performances but Willem Dafoe is definitely the standout performance with an unsettling and terrifying presence.Jon Watts' direction is superb, the action sequences are thrillingly acrobatic once again but refreshingly impactful this time around. There's a few homages to the styles of the previous iterations and some gorgeous imagery.It's also perfectly paced with none of its roughly 2hr 30 minute runtime feeling dull or overly long due to a strong momentum established early on. The CG is extremely impressive with only a few weak spots.The music by Michael Giacchino is fantastic, a nice balance of themes from the previous iterations and use of Holland's iconic motifs which are slightly altered in ways that work as well as a few new additions that are beautifully epic."

Marvel comics is use to turning personal stories into epic events but for me that's strange for the movies.It does work better for the design of these Spider-Man movies, simple because spider-man is perfectly design for those personal stories. In this case it was one of the biggest crisis Peter Parker had to face when one of Spider-Man's biggest enemies J. Jonah Jameson (think about it) reveals to the world that he's spider-man. The event has Parker taking on personal issues that come with the reveal as Spider-man comes under criminal allocations (forcing him to need a lawyer (wink, wink), and his fame as the web swinging Avenger is divided, by those who love him and those who hate him. All this, not only messing up his life but the lives of those closet to him so he does a Marvel team up with Dr. Strange to change all that.The results of this team up turn No Way Home into the ultimate Fan film bringing together everything we loved about Spider-Man in Cinema for the last twenty years. In this plot No Way Home was spectacular. They paid homage to everything good about all the Spider-Man movies and poked fun of everything bad about the Spider-Man movies. We got to relive some things in spider-man movies that were not all that good made so much better in this film and things that were sensational in some of the movies were made even more sensational for this movie. Would love to be more detailed about what I'm talking about, but there is far too much story to spoil so I don't think I can.I'll say that No Way Home is an evolution for Spider-Man. We literally get so much Spider-Man, noting that next year will be the characters 60th birthday and it feels like we are getting that anniversary special a year (or few mouths) early. The best part is that as much as I love Tom Holland's Spider-Man he finally becomes the Spider-Man comic fans have known for the past 60 years in this movie.The action was exciting, the level of drama was top level. It could have made me laugh more but I loved the fact that they were more concern with showcasing the true type of hero Spider-Man is.

It is not that there were no problems. The biginning was erratic, full of silly dialogues and with everything happening too much in a hurry. MCU version of Spider-Man is also quite problematic, with several Stark armours unrelated to Spider-Man suit, with an MJ who is not Mary Jane, and with a superhero who has never met any of the classic enemies of Spider-Man (at least he was not Tony Stark's assistant anymore). It is symbolic that only facing the multi-verse he knew them and he listened that with great power comes great responsibility. However, the inspiration in brilliant Spider-Man into de Spider-verse brought a quite amusing script, since Peter Parker disturbed Doctor Strange's spell. There are many nice gags from this moment on, and I loved to see all those characters back. It was particularly awesome to see Willem Dafoe, Andrew Garfield, Tobey Maguire and Alfred Molina reprising their roles. As a matter of fact, the Green Goblin was even nicer now than in 2002 (both visually with that hood without mask, and in an inspired performance by Dafoe)! I may also add that the good ending was a very smart way to fix the enormous mistake it was having transformed the Spider-Man (the most important of Marvel superheroes!) in a junior secretary of Iron Man."

They cast a spell of wiped memory and screw it up, reality is torn, familiar faces invade different spaces... you know this, you've seen the trailer. It's the Sony/MCU equivalent of X-Men: Days of Future Past, with a stream of old band members coming out of retirement for a jam-packed farewell concert.One might hope that the results are a smidge better than that old X-Men reunion, and they are, but No Way Home also suffers from many of the same problems. Primarily, the overwhelming urge to stuff as much crap on the screen as possible, even when the audience is already exhausted. It tries to serve too many masters and, in the end, sufficiently serves none. There's fun to be had, especially when the oddball mix-and-match super-characters get the chance to escape the trappings of a broader storyline and simply converse as individuals. Those accessible human interactions have been a big strength for the two preceding Marvel Spider-Man flicks, and they reap great benefits here, each time the old guard mingles with the new.I wish we had more such moments, but the push to turn the MCU's most grounded franchise into another big-time tent pole attraction demands otherwise. In reaching for the next major event, they've overlooked the ""neighborhood"" part of ""Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man."" Actually, they might've forgotten the ""friendly"" part, too, because there's a whole bunch of angst spinning around Tom Holland's central performance. But that's more excusable: Peter Parker goes through a lot over the course of this hundred-fifty minutes, he progresses and matures as a character, and he's experienced equally dark times in the comics.No, the performances aren't the issue here, nor is the dialogue, which remains snappy and delightful. The primary culprit is the plot, bloating and careening in indeterminate (and often mindless) directions, making a lot of noise but not making a lot of sense. Dr. Strange hand-waves many explanations under the guise of mysticism, which is basically his thing, but so do the various Spider-Men. Important members of the supporting cast are marginalized and under-served. The city of New York, once an essential ingredient, is now barely a backdrop. Goalposts are moved, overshadowed, and then moved again. Rumor has it that script re-writes were still underway during filming, and it shows.This is messy. Lots of fun on certain occasions, but stifling and sludgy in others. It's a mixed bag, leaning more to the positive than the negative, but I don't know that I'm content with the way everything wraps up in the end. Where Homecoming and Far From Home both left me charged and anxious for the next step, No Way Home put me in a place of quiet acceptance. Feels like the franchise has aged, and that's not a great thing."

I don't know how many people were there because of the ""2-2-22"" T-Mobile perk... All I know is that I have wanted to see this since it was released, and I was offered a perk, so I jumped on it.It occurred to me that the theater that I was in was the exact theater that I was in 20 years ago during the first Spider-Man movie... so it was totally appropriate that this film included elements and characters from the first trilogy and the second duology...I never thought the second set of Spider-Man movies was that bad, I always thought Andrew Garfield did a good job.The Tom Holland spidey starts off here with his own set of problems of course, caused by an ""Even Worse"" and partially hair-challenged J Jonah Jameson who was introduced at the end of the previous Spidey film.Ironically, however: this movie plugs in to the Multiverse idea that has been explored in WandaVision and Loki, which appears to be the main gist of the next Doctor Strange movie.Watching comic book based movies today is like collecting comic books, back in the days when I collected. These are no longer self-contained films, just like they were not self-contained issues of the titles I collected. They all ""crossover"" into themselves. I still have many of my marvel crossover trade paperbacks including my X-Men Phoenix and Dark Pheonix sagas, Phalanx Covenant, Days of Future Past and Present. After the tail end of the swath of destruction left by the Infinity Wars, it appears that these films are even more interconnected.Plus it was great to see crooks that were part of the first sets of movies, and some of those characters even reminiscing about details from those films.But for those who would blame Peter Parker for all of these conundrums, you have to remember it wasn't just his fault, the female Loki variant had a lot to do with this big mess as well. That's all I can actually say about it. Before you go see this it would be a good idea to watch everything that leads up to Endgame, including the Spider-Man title previous to this one, the three Sam Raimi Spider-Man films, as well as the two Garfield films... It's the only way to stay sane, and it is the only way any of this will make sense.I suppose a lot of people were writing reviews about this film and mine got hung up in the queue... and of course I will be getting nonhelpful votes because I liked this movie."

Recency Bias is potentially in full effect here but as of right now this may be in my top 5 MCU films. Holland once again flexes on why he's the best all around Spider-Man we've had and the cast around him really brought it all up a notch.I'm finding it weirdly hard to say much about this one because, while I think a lot of people know the conceit of this move, I've always found Marvel to be quite adept at misdirection with their trailers. They give you enough to think you know what's going on and still manage to throw a curveball or two and I feel like that was definitely in effect here. So, broad strokes. As I said, the cast is amazing. Everyone here really seemed to be enjoying their time and cranking out really solid work. There was one CGI intensive individual who I felt was... Not so great, but that aside I was quite pleased overall.I think the biggest positive was in the overall universe though. Love it or Hate it, the MCU was a game-changing creation in cinema. It makes a ridiculous amount of money and since its inception and success we've had pretty much every other franchise or studio wanting to get in on the Cinematic Universe game. I think we can unilaterally agree Marvel has been the most successful with this but it has come at a cost. The Marvel Formula, that singular thematic note that runs across so many of their films and has a tendency to make them all feel fairly similar. This one felt different to me. Thanos and the Infinity Stones are in the rearview. We're moving away from Iron Man's domination of the universe and getting to this stage where these heroes can interact with each other and/or the world on their own without some huge, overarching forced contrivance. This shift in tone, this lack of being on the Infinity track really let me sit back and watch this movie and finally feel like this was a lived in universe and I loved that.That aside, I didn't care for Black Widow, and Shang-Chi was fun but overall kinda meh to me. I had worried that COVID may have brought about the end of the MCU's streak of great popcorn flicks but Spider-Man swung in and saved the day. I've suddenly got renewed hope and excitement going forward. Hell, I'm even a little pumped for Morbius now, even though I'm still pretty sure that wont be any good.As for the theater experience... I missed it but I think I'll be staying home for the majority of releases and only venturing out for the big, effects driven spectacles. That's probably a whole different discussion though."

An excellent cast and a whole avalanche of good special effects and action scenes, this movie manages to meet the expectations of Spider-Man fans. The strongest point of this film is undoubtedly the nostalgia of those who grew up with the films of Tobey McGuire and Andrew Garfield. They have been given a new opportunity and many of the villains' actors have managed to stay true to their characters after years. The script may be questionable, but that ceases to matter. This movie is a thrilling experience that only true Spider-Man or Marvel fans can appreciate. My final rating for this movie is 10/10."

More than ever we begin to see things from Peter's point of view, and it sculpts a very touching and emotional narrative that is easily the best execution in a Marvel property in a while.

It blends the past characters so well into its story you hardly feel it's their first time in the universe.

Disney's resources can be used to craft amazing pieces, and No Way Home shows just how much of the good stuff they have when they put their time and money to it. Spiderman's dive into the multiverse is beautiful on almost all fronts in both design and animation. Dazzling displays of light, color, flashing, and explosions are blended together to make exciting, comic book feeling moments, all while getting hit with darker layers as the fight progresses. Spiderman facing the various villains seen in the trailer are fantastic, as web slinging, dodging, and various blasting occurs to rock the screen with amazing, theater rumbling effects. It's a very cinema worthy movie for this alone, but there is so much more to it.The Comedy:
Disney is all about cramming the jokes into the movie to lighten things up, and sometimes they take it too far. Fortunately, No Way Home manages to keep the comedy in check, timing things at the opportune moments and hitting running gags to keep us ingrained in the MCU Spiderverse. The banter was mostly kept in check, each of the characters styles blended well together with awesome chemistry, and even better it was not too much to trip up the emotional moments this movie has, which is a fantastic balance for this reviewer.The Action:
For the most part, the fights and chases in this movie feel very much like something from the Marvel comic universe. Taking that classic Spiderman taunting, while implementing strategy, agility, and use of environment, led to some decent moments that were suspenseful and interesting to see what damage would be caused. As the movie's tone changed, the nature of the fights changed too to keep pace, and by the end it was an amazing blend of comedic, action, and emotion to paint a near perfect finale for me.The Acting:
Again, Marvel casted well in this movie and opens up so many great chemistry networks between the characters that were in this movie. Holland is still a wonderful blend of Peter Parker and Spiderman, who has taken the character again to further heights and pulls the character through the ringer. This movie puts the main character into the ringer and Holland does things so well to really grab that emotion and pull at your heart strings. Zendaya's quality still shines through, and her rendition of M. J. still holds the same core foundation, but starts to further evolve and grow the seeds planted at the end of Far From Home. Cumberbatch as Dr. Strange is top notch as usual, he's fun, he's classy, and he really sets the stage for the future of the character in this bizarre multiverse being set up and is exciting to see this transition layering more onto the character. Jacob Betalon as Ned again rocks in the comedy moment, but also extends to some other moments that were again perfect for the story. Alfred Molena, reprises the role of Doc Oc super well, bringing the same narcissism intellect of the character, but diving back into the complexity of the character we had in the second movie. There are so many more to compliment, but I can't due to potential for spoilers, but rest assure that the chemistry between this cast is a mixture of quality.Handling the Characters Well:
Spiderman: No Way Home had a lot of balls to juggle and for me, they did it quite well with the material they had to present. Extending the story from the end of the last movie, while mixing in Strange felt very natural, with adequate time spent listing out the problems and solutions the two ""Avengers"" had to find for the spell that went wrong. And once that door was opened, the complexity of the story required a lot more planning and direction. Watts and the team succeeded, managing to keep a lot of characters in the mix and making sure their inclusion was meaningful past the simple marketing for toys. Even the villains get some decent balance, again bringing their own interactions and plot components that for the most part were not forced or counteractive. It was a fantastic display of coordination and effort and given the potential disaster this could have been, I'm very much happy with the results.The Emotional Heart:
These movies and characters mean the world to the fans, and that means crossing into the heartstring pulling territory. No Way Home hits this several times, and I loved the moral testing components that they wrote in here for so many characters. Diving deeper into these characters, we got past the simple good-guy vs. Bad-guy motif and instead got something much bigger that again justified the inclusion of so many things. This is certainly one of the clutch moments of the MCU and I dare say it was something that sets so much up for the rest of the wave.DISLIKES:Pacing at the beginning:
It's all about the set up and making sure we are ready for everything to happen in the movie. As such, that was the part of the movie that I found to be a little drawn out and boring at times for me. I don't know if I was just tired, or I was hoping for a little more movement or suspense and it took about the first thirty minutes before the first fight really kicked in. Once that happened, the pacing issues were very minor at that point, only going a bit fast a few times in how some of the twists were brought in.The Computer work at times:
As much as I enjoyed the special effects and CGI, I can't say that it was flawless. No Way Home does have moments where the computer look reared its head and took shortcuts into the less realistic looking realm. The very artificial movements, the digital look to the skin, and a few other moments did drop into the lower resolution. Again, a minor flaw for me, but something I have seen in the past get fans upset.The Action at Times:
There are times where the fighting really started to ramp up, finding a great pace and stride that was gearing up for a great Spiderman brawl. However, the action would then trip and lose that momentum with an abrupt ending. There were great moments where they achieved all those incredible fighting sequences, but there were times I would have liked a little more coordination and magic that we had with other films, especially at the end with the way they were solving some problems. It feels like they were running out of time and some cuts were made to offset the full coordination, but again this is still a nitpick moment for picking on to find the answer.Some of the Bad Guys Needed A Little More:
Doc Oc as I said earlier was a fantastic villain they did so much with and Green Goblin as well has the bite that feels like an extension of the classic character. However, the Lizard and Sandman (which have been seen in the trailers), felt a little more time was needed to further expand upon their characters more and give them the same bite they held long ago. I know the reasons they were brought in for the most part, but... there still could have been some more fun with them to help get a little more mojo and time with them would have been amazing.Predictable:
I got most of the twists they were trying to surprise us with. Lots of foreshadowing handed you the keys to getting the big events that were going to happen and how they were going to help repair the mess they were looking. I can't say that the call of things being a surprise were really a surprise. However, this minor dislike still does not take away from the enjoyment of the movie for me.The VERDICT:
Spiderman No Way Home achieved a lot of greatness for this reviewer and makes me feel a little more comfortable from what is coming out of Marvel in the future. It's a fun movie that has so much to it and really brings forth an amazing experience meant for viewing in the theater. It's exciting, it's got heart, it's got comedy, and it keeps many things in the air with a balanced manner that was certainly exceeding the expectations that I had going in. No Way Home shows the multiverse may be in good hands and if they can continue this art of balance of new ideas and foundations, then we are in good hands. Sure, there are some pacing issues at time, some simplified solution finding, and a few characters needing a little more time. However, overall, this film is in the top Spiderman movies and I strongly encourage you to see it in the theater if you can find the time.My scores are:Action/Adventure/Fantasy: 9.0
Movie Overall: 8.0-8.5."

They all have a great dynamic and work well together.The return of all the Sam Raimi Spider-Man villains was amazing seeing.Alfred Molina as Doctor Octopus, Willem Dafoe as Green Goblin, and Sandman played by Thomas Haden Church were all great.The return of the Marc Webb Spider-Man villains is also amazing seeing.Jamie Foxx as Electro and Rhys Ifans as The Lizard were also both great as the villains from the other movies.There are a lot of scenes where I was surprised, emotional, and excited to see what was going to happen next. I was mostly surprised when watching it beginning to end.The fight scenes with Spider-Man vs the villains were excellent and really well played out. Benedict Cumberbatch as Doctor Strange is still great as the character and his scenes were really cool.The 3rd act final battle was awesome and I highly recommend you to see it in the movie theater on the big screen, especially in IMAX.Spider-Man fans like myself will love this movie and have a great time watching it from beginning to end.Jon Watts is a great director and made 3 really great Spider-Man movies with a ending that made me excited to see more."

Bad/mediocre reviews made me avoid them. I am not a movie snob, i like watching every genre, art movies, drama movies, superhero movies. A movie is defining by its story/acting/directing, and these factors are common in every genre. NO WAY HOME is a good movie. I enjoyed it and i didn't feel the 148 minutes. I could definitely watch more. Holland's acting improved and matured, however he must be even better. It's obvious that Garfield and Maguire overshadowed him. That's ok, he is younger than them, but time flies.It's a good movie but something's missing. Magic maybe? And i am afraid to watch the rest of MARVEL movies of the last two years because their reputation is way worse. There are many dumb moments here due to lazy writing. Jokes seemed forced too, they didn't land well except a few times. Action scenes are almost great. But this wouldn't be good without these villains and ""Parkers"". All aboard the nostalgia train. This worked here but they should find something new to intrigue us. INFINITY WARS and ENDGAME were masterpieces. I don't think they can top these.Also, i hate to say it, but these young actors are not so charismatic.In any case, this is pure entertainment and i wish they keep producing movies at this level. Even if they can't top their past movies, at least, be this good."

The film follows Peter after the events of ""Spider-Man: Far From Home,"" as he faces a new challenge: the world now knows his secret identity, and his life is turned upside down.Plot
Peter Parker's world is turned upside down when his secret identity is revealed. His life, along with those of his loved ones, is threatened by the media and public scrutiny. In desperation, he turns to Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) for help. Strange casts a spell to make everyone forget Peter is Spider-Man, but halfway through the process, Peter realizes he doesn't want everyone to forget. This unintended consequence opens a crack in the universe, leading to the return of villains from previous Spider-Man films.Characters
Tom Holland delivers a stellar performance as Peter Parker, showcasing his emotional turmoil and heroism. Zendaya's Michelle adds warmth and humor, while Jacob Batalon's Ned provides gentle comic relief. Benedict Cumberbatch's Doctor Strange brings a new dynamic to the relationship between Peter and his mentor.Atmosphere and Visuals
The film has a darker tone compared to its predecessors, with a focus on the personal and emotional struggles of Peter. The action sequences are intense and well-choreographed, with a mix of epic battles and heart-wrenching moments. The visual effects are stunning, creating a visually appealing experience.Conclusion
""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" is an epic entry in the MCU, featuring fan service and emotional depth. The film's ability to balance fan service, action, and character development makes it a standout in the franchise. It's a must-watch for fans of the MCU and those looking for a thrilling and emotionally charged superhero film.Rating: 9/10."

I kind of hate the idea of delving too deep into a multiverse, because I think it muddles things too much, and defies the internal logic of most stories. Sure enough that was something I felt while watching this film. This movie cannot hold up to even the tiniest bit of analysis, because it creates plot holes that you can drive a freight train through. It's kind of sad because there were some moments in the movie that I genuinely loved, but all I can think about days later are the myriad of questions that I'm left with because this movie created so many situations that make no sense.My other big problem with Spider-Man: No Way Home is not really a fault of the movie, but more of the society we live in today. Living in an internet-focused culture, we are bombarded by ads and news stories that relate to the things that interest us. SInce I've shown my love for all things MCU in the past, of course I see plenty of things crossing my radar about the upcoming films. I was able to avoid watching any trailers for this movie, which I thought would help, but by merely catching headlines of casting rumors I could foresee every surprise they built into it. Of course any logical mind could put two and two together once the guest appearances start, so I suppose this isn't a movie that is going to blow away audiences with its surprises.As I said, though, my disappointment is quite frustrating because I also found many aspects of No Way Home so satisfying. They wrapped up some story elements nicely, and this might have contained some of the best acting in any Marvel movie. In particular, I found Zendaya so surprisingly strong, I was almost able to ignore her lack of character motivation in some key moments. She wasn't the only person in the film that behaved stupidly, in fact the central premise of the film is built on a horrible idea from Aunt May that seems altruistic, but lacks any 4th-dimensional thinking which I would expect from a genius like Peter Parker. But smart people being dumb is the catalyst of the entire story, as even Dr. Strange doesn't seem to think anything through, past Peter's initial request.No Way Home is easily the most meta Spider-Man movie ever made, which is kind of shocking to say in a post ""Into the Spider-verse"" world. It's catering to the most die-hard fans in the world, but it's more of a nod to the fans of the Spider-Man movies. I was always a huge fan of the multitude of Spider-Man comic books when I was a collector, but I've typically struggled with his portrayal in films. So, giving all these nods to things that came before Tom Holland took over the role on the big screen, falls a bit flat for me. One of the things I loved about this iteration of the character is that it avoided the cliches and saved us so much of the traditional Spider-Man origin story, but this movie back-pedaled and became a copy of a copy of a copy.This return to cliche also sucked some of the emotion out of key moments as any fan of the character should know the same old tropes by now. I almost got emotional at the end because of the great acting performances, but the big emotional moment earlier in the film did nothing for me as all I could think was ""really, we're going there?"" There are some good laughs in the film, although I wonder how well it will hold up on rewatch. And I will rewatch this film, as I do with all MCU movies, but I think at this point Spider-Man: No Way Home sits as my least favorite in the franchise. In fact, I'm at a point right now where I'm questioning if I will keep being a diehard fan of everything the MCU churns out. This film wasn't what I'd call a complete failure, but I'm concerned the MCU is getting closer to one of those. Perhaps EndGame should have been exactly what the title implies."

So, at its core, this film is much more than CGI and multidimensional sci-fi. It deals with loss, redemption, forgiveness, introspection, malevolence, and second chances. The screenplay is low on comic book babble and high on human traits that can be used as food for thought in real life. All of the characters are well developed with individual personalities.It was also great to see the last three actors that played the iconic spiderman on one stage. We get scenes with Tom Holland, Andrew Garfield, and Toby Maguire. This film brings together fans of the Spiderman movies from the last twenty-two years. So no matter which actor you liked the best that played the web-slinger, this film will entertain you since it brings back all three together. The film also brings back some favorite actors that played the villains into one picture. Particularly the great William Dafoe as the Green Goblin. Seriously, this film has a fairly large cast of A-listers that provide a hugely entertaining picture.The film also has plenty of heart, warm and comedic scenes. The film provides some belly laughs and some tear-jerking scenes. It does all this without the nauseating misandry politics that plague recent Disney films.This film was well worth the watch.P. S. As of March 13, 2022.Here are the IMDB stats on this film.504,690 IMDb users have given a weighted average vote of 8.7 / 10
Arithmetic mean = 8.7 Median = 9I can, with great confidence say that the trolls giving this film 1s and 2s can be ignored with great reassurance. The film has already been a blockbuster success at the box office and is making a killing in after box office streams. Hence, it stands to reason that the average viewer is quite fond of the film and will be entertained. The trolls are trying to fight a battle when they already lost the war. To use adult logic in a children's comic book film in some of the reviews is stuff to chuckle at."

It's obvious and clear that within the sustained runtime, a lot is gonna happen. And by this Spider-Man instalment's poignant ending, you'll realise why there's so many spoiler reviews throughout its aftermath.As said and without spoiling, this brilliantly designed action movie is abundantly eventful and exhilarating. It might mean there's emotional deaths of shining characters, but it could easily mean that the action's a lot more frequent than in the previous films or it could end tragically. Luckily, No Way Home stuck with the best outcome of the greatest Spider-Man action sequences we've probably ever seen in a Spider-Man instalment.One thing that needs to be said clear about this sequel is the fact that it's actually really emotional, and despite its bomb of majestic humour, a tear might actually slip out your eyes a few times. Tom Holland, Zendaya and the other heroes and villains only continue to get better with appealing improvements. The action is spectacularly edited and created, but there's unforgettable heart amongst the entertaining steps it takes. Considering Far From Home was a blast and how this one is just as breathtaking, another sequel will be highly anticipated.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews."

This was possibly the best plot ideation to connect multiple reboots into one cohesive movie. Nothing felt forced or questionable.3. While it is not a flawless movie, those flaws are so minuscule that it hardly matters and I've never expected another MCU movie would be as good as Endgame or almost better than it.4.

Tom Holland further solidifies that his portrayal of the iconic superhero, is the best. Zendaya is outstanding as MJ. Holland & Zendaya share electrifying chemistry, in all their scenes together. Jacob Batalon is superb as Ned Leeds. Jamie Foxx is brilliant as Max Dillon/Electro. Willem Dafoe is phenomenal as Norman Osborn/Green Goblin. Dafoe proves yet again, why he's the best Spider-Man villain in the entire franchise. Alfred Molina is excellent as Otto Octavius/Doctor Octopus. Thomas Haden Church is great as Flint Marko/Sandman.

As a Spider-Man movie, it doesn't get more Spider-y than this, with the amount of characters and how they are handled. It's not an Avengers-level movie, but reminds of it and yet feels more grounded and ""smaller in scale"" (quite similar to Far From Home). The sum of it's parts make for a very dense script, while keeping consistency of theme and tone throughout. There aren't any ""lows"" as I felt it's predecessor had, but the highs (outside of some particular elements for people invested in the franchise) aren't as highs as the whole concept and creativity of Mysteryo's reveal in the previous entry. It's hard to explain.. but I think of it as a lot of little pieces put together in a way that it feels grander as an experience that's hard to disappoint, yet the divisions of the puzzle-parts are quite clear and noticeable.If this is your first Spider-Man.. It might not get you there. And any Dr Strange fan might find this a complete travesty to his character as it was introduced! I sure did. But personally, and considering what they went for, it's hard to think about anything I was unhappy with or things I would change (aside from Stephen Strange), which is a good sign on any viewing! Had more serious and emotional bits than expected, great action as well. This is clearly fabricated to be as ""hype"" as it is because it was fabricated with a lot of love and respect for what it has been since Avi Arad."

The film is also a great thriller with more than a few sincere tear-jerking scenes.""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" also seems to be a metaphor for our current world with the implication that even the worst of villains could be reformed. Some may argue that this is naïve and that the task is likely impossible. Maybe so but the film's argument is still very emotionally powerful. - dbmateurcritic."

They continue to keep their fan base energized and happy. Even the general audience is totally into it too. Kevin Feige and his group are still able to improve upon the already incredible heights that they have already achieved. Their new Disney+ shows have been exactly what they needed to be, fresh and entertaining. Their slate of films since Spiderman: Far From Home (2019), have been pleasantly, surprisingly good.Since the new stuff is humming along, in order to really preserve the franchise for a long time, you need to preserve some of that early history, that got you there. You don't want everybody saying, ""Well, I don't want to watch the old Spiderman movies. They aren't part of the MCU"". No! You want them to watch all your stuff, old and new. Plus, it helps that in the real world, Disney, Sony and Marvel had to come to some kind of a compromise with their IPs, the use of Tom Holland, etc., so why not make that compromise a fitting homage to what Sony started.So, in the MCU universe, why not create this idea of a multi-verse. You can satisfy Sony by bringing back a huge chunk of the elements from their original films and engage with fans across three ""generations"" of different Spiderman franchises, thus making all of them canon with the MCU. A brilliant way to continue generating cash from that amazing IP, known as Spiderman.So, as we left off from Spiderman: Far From Home (2019), we are already treated with a taste of the Sony Spider-verse when J. Jonah Jameson (played by J. K. Simmons, who played JJJ in all three of the Sam Raimi/Tobey McGuire Spiderman films from 2002-2007), shows up to reveal to the world that Peter Parker is Spiderman. Already the audience is thinking multi-verse plot lines, alternate timelines and the possibility of an amazing team up coming. Couple that with some of the events in Avengers: Endgame (2019), the MCU series Loki and everything you have heard in the press and the trailers for Spiderman and Dr. Strange and you are ready for what looks like a multi-verse event coming next. With Spiderman: No Way Home (2021), you will not be disappointed.Now that the world knows who Peter (Tom Holland), is, his life has been a disaster, but, it's not so much his life he is worried about, but the effect it is having on his friends and loved ones. He decides to enlist the aid of Dr. Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), to see if he can go back in time to fix his problem before Jameson can announce to the world his secret but, Strange thinks the best way to solve this problem is to use a spell to make people forget he is Spiderman. Unfortunately, Peter's meddling screws up the incantation, which causes a disruption in the multi-verse, sending Spiderman villains from everywhere to Tom Holland's doorstep.That is where the film goes from there. Director, Jon Watts, who has now directed all of the MCU Spiderman films, gives us a great story that answers all the questions, pays homage to the other incarnations and ties up things nice to move the MCU forward. Be ready for plenty of surprises, lots of good funny moments and it even tugs at your emotions at some points in the film. It's a culmination of the last 20 years of Spiderman films and brilliantly collects a cast together that will make you thrilled.8.9 (A- MyGrade) = 9 IMDB."

This is because the nostalgic portion of this film is a compliment to the story itself - and not the main focus.Credit for this must go to returning Director Jon Watts (he Directed the previous Spidey outing, FAR FROM HOME) and screenwriters Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers (and the powers to be at Marvel Studios). They balance the action -and a plotline that could be confusing - with ease. They made a basic, but important, decision. They kept things as simple as possible and leaned on the characters - and performances - to be the core of this film (and not the plot intracancies, the nostalgia and the Special Effects).This is easy to do when you have 3 main characters in Tom Holland, Zendaya and Jacob Batalon as Peter Parker, MJ and Ned that are very charming and endearing performers at the heart of it - characters that the audience wants to spend time with. Add to that the domineering and forceful performance of Benedict Cumberbatch as Dr. Strange, the comic relief of Jon Favreau's Happy Hogan and the warm and loving performance of Marisa Tomei as Aunt May and this film has a solid foundation to build on.And, of course, there are the appearances of other characters/performers that the audience will well know from other properties - to mention them would be to spoil this film - but, suffice it to say, each one tops the one before it, building to a fun crescendo of heart, humor, action and nostalgia.A very winning combination - and well worth checking out. And...if you're comfortable with doing this - see it with an audience, it adds to the experience.Letter Grade: A9 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"
9,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7665033/?ref_=tturv_perm_157,A Spider-Man Movie I Never Knew I Needed,,9,23,kjproulx,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur23240045/?ref_=tturv_usr_157_t,20-Dec-21,"Whether you're talking about classic comic books, animated television shows, or live-action films, Spider-Man has been in my life for decades. Not only has the character been my favourite superhero throughout my life, but I've loved watching every adaptation as well. I viewed all three Sam Raimi films on repeat as they were released and the same went for Marc Webb. The animated Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse was also a fantastic surprise a few years ago. As the Marvel Cinematic Universe grew and they began to include Tom Holland as the web-slinger, I was falling in love with the character all over again. Even if I had issues with any of the movies, the character has always put a smile on my face. When I started hearing what Spider-Man: No Way Home was going to be about, there was no way I wouldn't be there on opening night. With that groundwork laid out, let's dive in.This film picks up immediately following the events of Spider-Man: Far From Home. Peter Parker's identity has now been released to the world and many believe him to be a murderer. Not knowing what to do with his life at this point, he seeks the help of Doctor Strange to try and wipe the memory that anyone knows who he is. It goes awry and villains from all of the Spider-Man films begin to emerge. From here, the story itself becomes something that can't be talked about in a review. All I will say is that the last hour of this film had me in tears on multiple occasions, emotionally or not.Tom Holland has impressed me as this character since his very first appearance in Captain America: Civil War. From there, he has done nothing but immensely improve on that performance in his own films, but I have never seen him this committed to this role. The way he carries emotion in his eyes or simply just has fun in the suit is unparalleled. On top of his great performance, this is also the absolute best that both Zendaya and Jacob Batalon have been as his friends/support. This trio soars in this film.From the score by Michael Giacchino making me emotional to the raw human drama I wasn't expecting, I will say that I've never felt the weight and stakes in a Spider-Man movie as much as I felt them here. What I also really enjoyed is that Spider-Man: No Way Home feels the most distant from the Marvel Cinematic Universe than the other two. The burden of needing to connect to that world has been a minor issue of mine, but this film nearly always puts Spider-Man front and center, giving him his first real, full story. I really don't want to speak further about the revelations throughout the film, or even the villains because I believe everything in that regard is so well-done and deserves to be seen by fans first.Overall, if I had to complain about anything, I would say that the first 20 minutes of this film felt a little rushed, even in the editing. I completely understood they wanted to get to the good stuff, but before the plot really gets moving, it felt a little choppy to me. With that said, that's a pretty minor complaint, seeing as I was still blown away by a lot of this film. Jon Watts has done a great job directing this trilogy of films and I can't wait to see what he's going to do with Fantastic Four. The last hour of Spider-Man: No Way Home is everything I wanted to see in a live-action Spider-Man, but I didn't quite realize how much I needed it. Walking out of this film, I wasn't wanting to rave about it because I knew I loved it, but I wanted to sit on it and really admire the effort here. Although not perfect by any means, Spider-Man: No Way Home is still a triumph and one of the most enjoyable moviegoing experiences I've had in a while."

Having whinged repeatedly about boredom over endless churning out of superhero movies, I've avoided them over recent years but got taken to this one at the cinema and was very pleasantly surprised.I aim to keep the summary simple as I have no wish to spoil the many surprises in this. What we have is the young Spiderman once again in way over his head this time getting caught up with Dr Strange in the multiverse! It's all a roller-coaster from there.Tom Holland proves he's an excellent young actor and on a par with the others whose have played the role in the past. The script is witty and funny, and the action may be a bit much but you feel it all comes together. The ensemble is great and very welcome but doesn't overwhelm the central young characters who in my opinion deserve all the credit in the Marvel world.The story thankfully is not the usual retread of the Marvel world, so we have a relatively different story that goes it's own way. I have to admit that I haven't watched the last Spiderman movie, but that didn't spoil my enjoyment here.If you want a fun action packed film, which doesn't rely on all the muscle, then this is it! It's very worthwhile watching. Just hope other superhero movies can learn lessons from this film."

The way he brought in all the characters, from the present, the past the other universe, magnificent.It will bring you entertainment, it will bring you joy, it will keep you glued to your seats, you simply cant guess the upcoming scene, let along the ending and the nostalgia that will shower, it's simply the wow factor in the movie.The covid and lock downs have hit every industry big time, but this is so much good, then the rest of senseles boring and pathetic movies that are coming for more then an year now.Buckle up, diaper up (you cant take a leak during the movie) and be very entertained."

Not that it was bad, just it didn't blow me away the way it seemed to do for so many. And I expected to see feel similarly about this - a film that ended up almost saving post-pandemic cinema and seemed to be lauded by just about everybody.It would be easy to see the multiverse as another MCU reset button, a desperate attempt to bolster flagging interest in the mega-franchise. Even if that is what lay behind the multiverse narrative here - and it may well not have been - this is the first time in a while that an MCU film has seemed to reignite some fun and inventiveness; it embraces creative ideas, is not afraid to be a little silly ... but it's also not immune to some Endgame like pomposity and over-inflated sense of its own ideas. That being said the film provides a genuine moral dilemma which, though not entirely explored as much as it could be, does give real food for thought.Two and a half hours is, of course, too long for this sort of film, but we're well past the point where anything superhero related has a sense of economy and efficiency.All told, I imagine the runaway success of this film is in part explained by an audience deprived of communal large-scale experiences thankful for something inventive, fun, and exciting; that's not meant to be faint praise ... it's just that a little further on from release it's more second-tier MCU than it is top tier. I do fear that the MCU is becoming so sprawling that it's starting to alienate the less committed fans ... but there's no denying that on its own terms this is genuinely ambitious and entertaining; something which the MCU tends to be at in its better incarnations."

And there were some characters like the lawyer who felt totally new even for people like me who've watched almost all Spiderman films.The upgrade of spider man suits & the usage of nanotech was interesting to watch but remember that Shankar has shown this to the mass audience in the best way in 2.0 itself back in 2018 itself, I don't think anyone has beaten that yet.Overall, it was a good watch and definitely a treat for the marvel fans."

9,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7649291/?ref_=tturv_perm_170,The best live action Spider-Man film ever made and probably ever will be made for that matter,,78,78,MrDHWong,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur18374284/?ref_=tturv_usr_170_t,16-Dec-21,"""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" is the third solo Spider-Man movie to be set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Starring Tom Holland once again in the lead role, it goes without saying that this is the best live action Spider-Man film ever made and probably ever will be made for that matter.In the events after ""Spider-Man: Far From Home"", the secret identity of Peter Parker (Tom Holland) as Spider-Man has been exposed to the entire world after his fight with Quentin Beck/Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal). No longer being able to take the onslaught of media and public backlash, Peter seeks help from Doctor Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) to cast a spell to make everyone forget he is Spider-Man. However, during the casting of the spell, Peter accidentally causes things to go wrong, fracturing the multiverse and leading to the emergence of many villains from realities unfamiliar to this one.Aside from Batman, the superhero that has left the most impact on me personally is Spider-Man. In fact, the very first superhero film I ever saw at the cinema was the 2002 Sam Raimi-directed ""Spider-Man"" starring Tobey Maguire. I'd probably go as far to say it is that film I credit with helping to kick-start my fondness for the genre as a whole, paving the way for many others like it. With ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" acknowledging not only the original Raimi films but the Marc Webb-directed, Andrew Garfield-led ""Amazing Spider-Man"" films as well, there was bound to be a lot of speculation surrounding whether or not it could live up to all this hype. In short, the answer is a resounding yes.Not since ""Avengers: Endgame"" has a Marvel superhero film affected me on such an emotional level and not since the 2008 ""Iron Man"" film has a solo hero story left this much of an impact. Of course, to discuss my favourite parts would give away vital spoilers so I won't go into too much detail here. I absolutely love the amount of respect paid to each of these series of films. Even the divisive ""Amazing Spider-Man"" films, which I actually liked despite their flaws, are treated with just as much love and affection as their Raimi/MCU counterparts. Moments like these go beyond simple fanservice and are clearly there as a thank you to everyone who have stuck with this iconic hero for almost twenty years now. They certainly put a big smile on the face of this responsible 30-something adult.The concept of the multiverse was first teased back in ""Avengers: Endgame"" and further elaborated on in the Disney+ series ""Loki"". However, for the most part, those ventures had a proper sense of management preventing things from spiralling out of control. Here, everything feels like fair game. The stakes are at an all time high as these villains pour out from their respective universes to seek vengeance on their particular Peter Parker, not knowing that they won't find him here at all. Anyone who knows me will remember that I love stories that involve alternate realities and history, so to see something like this combined with a film about one of my favourite superheroes was nothing short of wonderful. This film keeps you on your toes as you anticipate who Spider-Man will fight next. Again, I won't reveal which of the villain fights excited me the most due to spoilers so all I will say is that each of them had at least one moment that made the young kid inside me very happy.Tom Holland has come a long way since we first saw him don the Spider-Man suit back in ""Captain America: Civil War"". His high-spirited youthfulness has not waned over the past five years since he still has that uncanny ability to entertain us with his unique take on the beloved hero. That's not to say he is only capable of light-hearted fun, as here we see him demonstrate some of his darkest acting to date. This film definitely isn't afraid to hit us hard in the feels at the most appropriate times, frequently delving deep into Peter Parker's emotional state at such an important point in his life.Additionally, I have finally come to accept Zendaya's performance as MJ. It has taken me three films but her version of the character has finally grown on me. Originally, I found her pessimistic attitude and willingness to bring the mood down highly annoying but she has now matured into a vital ally of Peter that I enjoy seeing on screen. Naturally, her chemistry with Holland feels genuine, considering the two actors are actually dating in real life with their romantic scenes adding that much needed heart to the film.I won't speak at length about any specific villain as that will give away major spoilers so all I will say is that seeing each of them again in one place was quite overwhelming, but this time in a good way. It's both amusing and surprising to see Raimi-era villains interact with Webb-era villains who are equally as confused as to why they have been transported into this universe. Something that certain Spider-Man films have come under fire for is their cramming of too many villains into one movie, leaving the story cluttered and incomprehensible. This time around, it actually works to the film's advantage since the idea of there being multiple universes following a different timeline has already been properly established. Something like this leaves things open for other multiverse-related oddities happening in future MCU projects, which excites me greatly.Since the film has set the bar so high, I can't help but wonder how the MCU will ever be able to top it. Like ""Avengers: Endgame"" before it, ""No Way Home"" should be treated as something of a watershed moment in the entire MCU. It succeeds in entertaining both longtime fans of the Spider-Man character who have been watching him for nearly twenty years while simultaneously serving the purpose as a great continuation of the ever-expanding MCU storyline. With that said, I think all fans of Spider-Man owe it to themselves to see this film as soon as possible. And yes, I do mean ALL fans.I rate it a solid 9/10."

The film is directed by Jon Watts, who also directed the previous two Spider-Man films.In the previous film, Spider-Man's secret identity was shared with the entire world. Peter Parker (Tom Holland) his life and the lives of his friends and family have now become a lot more difficult, because the whole world is after them and doesn't allow them any privacy anymore. To get things back to normal, Peter asks Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) for help. With a magic spell, Strange tries to make the whole world forget Peter's secret identity, but Peter's interference causes the spell to go awry. As a result, the multiverse breaks open and villains from other universes now end up in Peter's universe. Together with Doctor Strange and his friends, Peter must defeat these villains in order to bring them back to their own universe. They must do this before the multiverse breaks open further.With this film, Marvel gets the chance to use old villains from previous Spider-Man films in their film series and further adapt it to modern times. Fans of previous Spider-Man films can relive old times with this film thanks to the bringing back of the older villains. Despite the fact that they use a lot of old elements from the older Spider-Man films, the film itself also has a good story of its own. Here, Peter and his friends are suddenly treated differently by the rest of the world because of their newfound fame.Thanks to the improved filming techniques and Mauro Fiore as the photography director, they manage to better capture Spider-Man and the returning villains in the film. Moments now come across as more believable compared to how it was done in the older movies. With CGI, they've also rejuvenated some of the actors who play the villains, so that it's almost like they've come back from the old movies.Despite the creative sides of the story, other things are a bit simple or a bit weakly brought to the fore in the story. As a result, drama moments and tension of certain events can be lost a bit. If the story had been better written, the movie itself could have been a lot better.The returning cast members from the previous Jon Watts Spider-Man films have to play their characters in some dark and dramatic ways. Tom Holland and Zendaya know how to bring this to the fore, but thanks to the script, Jacob Batalon continues to be used more for comic moments in the film.The returning villains from previous Spider-Man films manage to recreate their roles in this film in a recognizable way and some even get the chance to expand their roles a little better or more in this film."

I am not against fan-service movies, as long as the plot is interesting and well developed. It is a film that overwelcome its staying, with a length of almost two hours and a half. I had to split the viewing on two different days, because I was getting really bored. There are tons of scenes that needed to be cut, as some plot points are completely useless. The premises are ridiculous: basically all the mess happening in the film is due to some Peter's whim. Therefore all the fights that we see against the villains were perfectly avoidable, if only Doctor Strange was a bit more responsible and would just clarify with Parker his intentions, before executing the spell. It baffles me that such a powerful sorcerer commits these mistakes, it does not make any sense.It is enjoyable seeing three different Spider-Men generations united in one great movie with their respective enemies to fight. However due to the excessive length, this meeting between Parkers came way too late, when my attention span was already really, really low. There are a few good moments between them, but there are many cringey jokes, worth probably of a preteen audience. Dialogues are cheesy and annoying. It is sad that screenwriters could not come with something a bit more creative and well thought out, especially considering that this was the big reunion that a lot of fans were waiting for a long time. It is a disappointing result that does not really add anything new to the big cinematic universe: once again the multiverse is mentioned, and finally we start to see a glimpse of some consequences of this topic on the MCU, but it is not enough, especially for a two hours and a half movie. If you are a die hard fan, maybe you will enjoy this movie more than I did. For me it was a wasted opportunity to do something really great."

I thought it was just better than previous films. But after I watched, it literally blew my mind. OMG!!! It was so great. So much fun and excitement. It's really a great film.I hate to write long reviews. So, I'm going to make it short. The only thing I want to emphasize here is that I'm happy to see three Spider-Mans in this film, especially Tobey Maguire. Tobey Maguire version of Spider-Man was the very first one I've ever watched. Too bad that there's no chance to see him after three films. But seeing him in this film made me think of the first time I watched his film. That's why I liked to see him in this film. He reminded me my childhood days.As for me, to point out bad things, I have many words. But to describe good things, I don't have anything but the word great. So, I'm going to say it in short version. This film is great. The acting is great. The original score is great. Everything in this film is great. So, the film turned out to be great even though I'm not that much fan of multiverse thing but I'm indeed a Spider-Man fan.All in all, Spider-Man: No Way Home is one of the best films I've watched in my entire life and one of my favourite films of all time.

Alfred Molina is another highlight and the banter between certain key characters was so, so enjoyable to watch.Without going too much into spoilers, there are so many different avenues to shoot off from this film.

Now I have watched it, here is my review for the film. The premise of the film sees Spider-Man's secret identity revealed, he tries to get Doctor Strange's help to fix things but this leads to some unwanted visitors from other universes to cause problems for both of them.Main Character
Tom Holland has played Spider-Man for a while now and for me this is his best performance in the role. You really see how he has grown and this film shows real depth to the character and how he has kind of grown up into this crazy world. He doesn't have much rest in the film and it really pushes Holland to impress in the majority of his scenes and I thought he was great in really making Spider-Man a top hero in The MCU.Supporting Characters
Zendaya plays MJ and I was just really happy to see the dynamic between her and Peter in this film. Despite everything that goes on they are a pretty strong couple and it is just nice for a comic book film to have a relationship that feels natural without overpowering the main plot. Benedict Cumberbatch reprises his role as Doctor Strange and he is really good, I really like how despite being a hero he has a more mature and different viewpoint to Spider-Man. He adds some really interesting parts to the film and plays a unique role in the progress of the story and Spider-Man as a character. Jacob Batalon is back as Ned and he is much better then the role he played in Far From Home. He is just a fun character that supports Peter, he is way more involved with Spider-Man and that improves his character so much. Marisa Tomei is back as Aunt May and again she is more involved this time out and is just a really great person for Holland to bounce off and the dynamic just really works and makes their relationship feel very real. Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina and Jamie Foxx reprise their roles as Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus and Electro. Dafoe and Molina are great and really flourish in their roles, but the surprise is Foxx as Max Dillon/Electro. He is so much better then he was in Amazing Spider-Man 2 and I am glad he got given this 2nd chance here.Story
The story is really great, I was worried with all of the multiverse elements that the focus could have been taken off of a character arc for Spider-Man but it nails this element. Peter has a real arc and it develops incredibly well and for me was a real highlight. It is obviously great seeing the returning villains and they are treated with respect and their characters are further explored. The ending feels deserved and because you are so invested it feels really earnt.Script
MCU films often get criticised for their scripts including too much humour in them, but I actually think the balance is really handled well here. Yes there are funny moments here but for me they didn't outweigh the serious and darker parts of the film.Style
The film looks great, the actions scenes are all really fun and seeing The MCU Spider-Man going against villains from the other franchises works very well and allows for some fun sequences. The pacing for the film is also really good, despite being 2 hours 30 mins it never felt too long and I honestly believe that there isn't really any filler here which is an impressive feat.Overall
Overall, Spider-Man: No Way Home is an epic film that really lives up to the hype. I am possibly still buzzing because I have just watched the film but I can't find too much fault and this is a Spider-Man fans dream film and anybody will find this film plenty of fun.Rating - 10/10."

(That's part of why the multiverse functioned best in Spider-verse: animated films can get away with being less tethered to reality.) Anyway, I loved seeing old characters return or the amusing banter, but this was my least favorite of the MCU Spider-man movies. The earlier tales, especially the first, worked because they felt like simpler teen movies and the main characters - Peter, Ned, MJ - had fantastic chemistry. Those moments were too few and far between here because we had so much multiverse to traverse and so much plot to explain. The twists were convoluted, the plot holes were large, and the whole thing worked better when it revolved around academic bowl and prom. Basically, my favorite MCU remains simpler MCU. Involving more villains (and heroes) than ever before was definitely not ""simple."" They're expanding their universe, but shrinking the story. Is it fun? Yes. Could it be better? Absolutely."

Simply put; a great (and mostly importantly, coherent) plot which has depth without becoming convoluted, the return of some of the fan-favourite villains, each updated without losing their charm, and an enforced investment from viewers.CGI and action scenes are brilliant, giving the likes of Doc Ock and Green Goblin the opportunity to revel in greater special effects. Plus the acting is just as good as it was nearly 20 years ago - Dafoe is superb yet again and even given the capacity to improve upon his previous goblin. Electro is hugely improved upon, stripping away the goofy style of The Amazing Spider-Man, and Sandman is kept consistent. Lizard still looks pretty stupid, but who cares. Honestly, the villains don't each get that much individual screen time, but there's so much else going on that it doesn't become a hindrance.It not a perfect film, but for someone who was a child when the original Spider-Man trilogy came out and has followed this character on screen since, it brings everything together, and is just joyful."

This movie is tailor made for the fans of the Spiderman franchise though it is a bit different in some aspects. Firstly, just like the Avengers series two other actors Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield are roped in make appearances along with Tom Holland. (This is not a spoiler since their names and characters are mentioned in cast in Google). An interesting scene has all 3 having a chat about their experiences in their respective universes. Sample this "" Did you ever get caught with no more web in your hands ?"" and "" Who was the deadliest enemy you fought ?"". Secondly , how would you feel if your superhero is battered, injured, dejected and down in the dumps ? Or better still can you imagine that Spiderman (or Peter Parker if you like) and his two friends want to join MIT ? The usual set of villains are there and Dr Strange ( Cumberbatch) has his magic powers to help out Spiderman. Also their adventures enhanced with mind blowing special effects are there in plenty. A few one liners placed intermittently do amuse. Spiderman's romantic interest MJ (Zendaya) is around though she is now Michelle Jones not Mary Jane. An evil one liner to remember is "" No good deed goes unpunished"". When all 3 form a team to kick evil ass, one Spiderman complains that he is not used to fight in a team! Fair enough. Where does Spiderman go when he is sad ? To the top of the Empire state building, of course."

William Dafoe, Alfred Molina, Jamie Foxx, Rhys Ifans and Thomas Haden Church revise their mischievous ways but Holland's version of our friendly neighborhood spider-man uses Stark's technology to help each one from being killed from their own universes. Tom, Zendaya and Jacob bring together the other Spider-man reprised by Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire. Marisa Tomei added a level of support, love and emotion to the point that we all cherish. The story showed a unique perspective of Spider-man that we haven't seen in any of the other films.

I think that in the story part there are no negative aspects, but in terms of the visual, it is a setback for the trilogy, since the action scenes are not like to the ones in the previous film, the special effects need to improve, the direction is not very committed since some scenes seem to be done very quickly and without much effort, there is no planning of where each character was going to be in the scenes or where the camera could widely capture what was happening. The ending seems confusing to me, but maybe it will be resolved in some other Marvel movie.Without a doubt, it is a film full of very effective surprises and that improves in terms of story and script compared to the other two, it is definitely worth it."

The film editing skillfully balances the multitude of characters and dimensions, creating a narrative that is both exhilarating and emotionally charged. Michael Giacchino's music adds depth and excitement to the film's epic battles. While its strength lies in its celebration of Spider-Man's legacy and the exploration of identity, it may occasionally feel overstuffed with characters and plotlines. Nonetheless, the cinematography captures the gravity-defying action sequences with stunning visuals.

I like almost all the MCU movies to some degree (Thor: The Dark World and the Eternals represent the low end and even those movies don't outright suck) but with the sheer volume, not every movie is must-see. To No Way Home's Credit, it feels like essential viewing and it's worth it to see in on the big screen. With the stakes, the action and the new precedent it sets for merging different movie universes, it's operatic and although it could be enjoyed in the privacy of your home, I'd absolutely recommend catching it at your local theatre.Truly ""special"" action in the MCU is hard to delineate. Almost all of the films in the series are at least good, a couple are merely passable and but there's a few standout action set pieces to be fair. One of the noteworthy entries is the original Doctor Strange, its pretty reliant on the CGI but its pretty thrilling and fighting between planes of existence is fun. They bring that style of fighting to No Way from Home and it works. I definitely have no complaints and it's just as effective transplanting it to here.Tom Holland's portrayal of Peter Parker is my favourite version of the character. I've said that since Homecoming and he's got the acting chops to capably pull off this character from both the physical and emotional sides. He's great again in this, some of Parker's immaturity hampers him but he's still the only actor that has truly pulled off young Peter Parker. I thought this was Zendaya's best work as MJ, she still has great chemistry with Holland and she gets more to do. I still liked Batalon's acting job as Ned even if his character was a little too goofy in some moments for the movie. Benedict Cumberbatch has Dr. Strange down at this point, he's similar to other characters that he's played but its good casting and I can't complain about that. It's always nice when Favreau shows up as Happy and it was great that Marisa Tomei finally got to show her range as Aunt May. She's been such a side character but she gets her moment in No Way Home. Seeing some of the old villains was a huge treat and despite some getting more screen time than others, no one phoned it in or didn't take it seriously. Willem Dafoe slips right back into Norman Osborne/The Green Goblin like a glove and out of all the returning characters, they did him the most justice by showing the duality of Osborne that I loved in Raimi's original. I was so excited to see Alfred Molina as Otto again, his portrayal in Spider-Man 2 is underrated, Molina showed up ready to work and they were true to his character in how he fit in the overall plot. I actually like Jamie Foxx better in this than in his original appearance, he seems more like himself and he retains his character's naivety while evolving a little. JK Simmon's return was my favourite part of Far From Home, he IS that character and I got the same sense of joy watching him build off of that character by parodying an Alex Jones style conspiracy theorist.I'll provide more of my thoughts on the overall story later but I wanted to touch on how the movie has real stakes and provides real growth for Peter Parker. It's harder to do that correctly than you would think but without spoiling anything, there's a spot in the movie where Peter is offered the choice between doing it the easy way or the hard way. He decides to try and be heroic and there are real consequences to that decision. The movie is effective at not only showing the consequences of those actions for the world at large but also with Peter. It's pretty jarring but as much as it's upsetting, that's what good movies accomplish and No Way Home invests the time to do it right.With how much No Way Home is getting showered with praise from both critics and fans alike, my review would be all positive but I did have a few comments on things that stuck out to me. While I enjoyed the sense of humour and fun that Homecoming and Far From Home, I do feel that the first half of the movie being so heavily angled towards the comedy undercut some of the stakes and emotional weight of the returning characters. I can't say much more without spoiling anything but I was so in awe when we got so see one of our favourites from the other universe that I was disappointed when it would be followed up by a slapsticky joke. But I might be in the minority there and I accept that. Some of the plot points weren't airtight as well, if you set aside the merging of the universes business and look at the story from a bird's eye view, the plot is kind of basic. If you nitpick enough, there are some holes. But I think that won't be a problem for everyone as well and I don't mean to just whine and ruin the experience for other people.Spider-Man: No Way Home is thrilling, heartbreaking and genre-bending. It deserves the ample amount of celebration its already gotten and I don't want the fact that I didn't think think it was perfect to cheapen my praise. Even if it isn't flawless (to me) it's a unique and memorable entry in MCU, there's superior character work, great acting, memorable action set pieces and A LOT of fun to be had. My audience cheered and applauded throughout the screening and instead of getting annoyed, it made me smile. It was nice that when some of the older characters made appearances that it meant as much to other people as it did to me growing up. No Way Home is still fantastic and if you're feeling fatigue from so many superhero movies, this is still one of the ones it's worth making time for and giving a chance."

Peter wants to make sure his buddies make it to MIT after his identity gets uncovered by the media and his life turns into chaos. To accomplish this, he tries to convince Doc. Strange to help him out. Things turn to a bad shape when they mess up Tom Holland as Peter's timeline.The first expectatation is to see all Spideys together. Andrew's apperance is ok, but Toby delivers. Marvel knew what to do with him and it went down good enough to be enjoyable.One of the themes is Tom's Peter's conflict as a superhero. The plot develops itself in a cool pace.As a major turning point in the series, of course you expect one big event to happen during the movie.

The characters all had fun arcs to get stuck into and the comedy aspect/chemistry really worked well, much better than I though in fact.

There's no doubt this had to be absolutely huge in order to match the hype it's got, but they pulled it off. I've been critical of other marvel films for not matching the hype, but this film is near perfection. Great characters, great plot and thoroughly fun.

I guess this is a film not really made for me. I found the way Hollands tries to plays up the good boy persona exceedingly off-putting AND not needed. Zendaya and the Filipino guy are just a figment on its story. They even tried to gentrify the ""other"" versions of Spiderman film. Funnily, I love all the treatment for the Original Spiderman characters. Otherwise, its a mixed bag.Secondly, I found the cause of conflict in the film so unnecessary. It does not make sense for me why and how it happened. It feels like watching a cash grab for fans.I mean the conflict of the film is that his presence as a superhero has such a negative effects to their live that they were ultimately banned to their collegiate school BUT it is contrast with a rally showing their popularity too. It is like be consistent film. Even the spell is hinged on the fact that they did not plan. They go on as if this is a thing he does every time BUT he just goes for it without really thinking through of the whatnots. Ultimately, the choice of Holland Peter to armchair psychologist ughh. Just watch it, its like a Bob the Builder-esque plot line.Ultimately, what really sour me about the film is the Dr Strange Conundrum. Why even watch when the consequences can be reversed and played on? I mean, he did had some in the end BUT is it really not deserved. As a viewer, I hate it from since the Avenger films BUT I hate it more so this time, because it actively says it can AND it can even personalize it.Overall, this is a pure cash grab for people who are watching it for the characters but not the content. Its pretty much anchored on a very weak premise AND feels like a connective tissue for things to come. [0.5/5]"

With the added benefit of being fully welcomed into the MCU, Tom Holland's Peter Parker has asserted dominance on the Mount Rushmore of spideys, but this installment proved that three spider-men are better than one.Yes, this film is pretty messy and cheesy, and Jon Watts and the writers tried to fit too many characters into the story, but there's something about seeing Holland, Andrew Garfield and the OG Tobey Maguire all don the suit and assemble to take on their infamous archnemeses. Of these, Jamie Foxx's Electro steals the show, which is fitting considering he originally appeared in the weakest entry to date.Despite the overall silly tone, 'No Way Home' is filled with mixed emotions, ups and downs, and bittersweetness. Parker's relationships with his friends and loved ones are tested and taken to the brink, so it will be interesting to see how future films handle some of the difficult consequences of this one.Putting aside the plot and bloatedness of the cast, with the introduction of the multiverse, 'Spider-man: No Way Home' has pioneered a concept that will enable Hollywood to find ways to bring together many beloved permutations of superhero castings - great for fans and business security alike."
10,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7954646/?ref_=tturv_perm_219,'Spider-Man: No Way Home' Is The Most Satisfying Movie In Spider-Man's Trilogy !!!,,8,11,cs_rahul_prasad,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur104563194/?ref_=tturv_usr_219_t,14-Mar-22,"'Spider-Man: No Way Home' on the surface, the most ambitious live-action Spider-Man movie Sony Pictures has produced. As the No Way Home trailers have already revealed, the new Spider-Man movie brings together three eras of Spider-Man, with villains from Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield's runs as Peter Parker jumping into the Marvel multiverse. We get Dr. Norman Osborn/ Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe) from Spider-Man, Dr. Otto Octavius/ Doctor Octopus (Alfred Molina) from Spider-Man 2, Flint Marko/ Sandman (Thomas Haden Church) from Spider-Man 3, Curt Connors/ Lizard (Rhys Ifans) from The Amazing Spider-Man, and Max Dillon/ Electro (Jamie Foxx) from The Amazing Spider-Man 2. It's all happening - in one Spider-Man movie.This allows Spider-Man: No Way Home - from returning director Jon Watts - to take a nostalgic trip down memory lane, though I wouldn't go so far to say that it's standing on the shoulders of giants. To be fair, many of the villains No Way Home brings back come from some terrible (The Amazing Spider-Man 2) and forgettable (Spider-Man 3, The Amazing Spider-Man) Spider-Man movies. That said, Spider-Man: No Way Home does its best to cast them in a new light and redeem them as best it can. Dafoe and Molina naturally fare better, the latter being part of what is still one of the best superhero movies of all time. But though it might feel like the universe is expanding - we have a proper multiverse - really, the Spider-Man universe is collapsing on itself in No Way Home. There are no new characters introduced in this round.Spider-Man: No Way Home sends Holland's Peter Parker to some dark places, though it's never too far away from another crumb of nostalgia it can't dangle in your face soon after. It's like bits of pathos are mixed in with dollops of, ""Oh look, fond (and not-so-fond) memories of other Spider-Man movies."" After all, there's the bigger matter of how this - the return of actors from old Spider-Man movies - all feels very much like a cynical commercial enterprise. Spider-Man: No Way Home ends in a slightly reassuring way that feels like Sony Pictures might be happy to put a lid on things, but we've always known that nothing is hallowed or permanent for Hollywood. They will dig up and exhume whomever they want, even if they must do so via hokey digital means.Picking up right where we left off in Spider-Man: Far From Home, we find Parker's regular life upending in front of his eyes. Cameras and attention follow him everywhere - he's the most famous person in the world now, we are repeatedly told - with some even coming for him, believing that he really did kill Quentin Beck/ Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal), the Far From Home holograph-specialist villain who presented himself as a dying hero to the world by manipulating footage. More importantly for Parker though, it's impacting the lives of those around him: his girlfriend MJ (Zendaya) and best friend Ned Leeds (Jacob Batalon) are rejected from colleges, and he and his aunt have to move homes to stay safe. Having had enough, Parker comes up with the worst possible idea.As you might have already glimpsed in the Spider-Man: No Way Home trailers, Parker asks Dr. Stephen Strange/ Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) to cast a spell that would make people forget that Peter Parker is Spider-Man. Set aside the stupidity around Peter asking for such a crazy favour - there are so many superheroes who have to live with the burden of their identity being in the open - what makes it more insane is how casually Doctor Strange agrees to his request. Strange waves off Wong's (Benedict Wong) warnings by saying they have used such spells for much tinier stuff in the past. Okay then. But invariably, things take for a turn for the worse after Parker realises that he's not properly conveyed his request: the spell Strange is casting will make everyone forget Peter Parker is Spider-Man. You know, including MJ, Ned, and May.Although it's easy to follow the film independently, knowledge of the previous Spider-Man films only enriches this sweeping experience. 'No Way Home' is undoubtedly the most crowd-pleasing Spider-Man film of all time. This celebration of your friendly neighbourhood Avenger solidifies the web-slinger as the most beloved Marvel superhero."

I didn't know exactly what they wanted to do with it and in which direction they were going. Luckily, that vision was held by director Jon Watts who became the first and only director to direct the entire trilogy at MCU. My conclusion is that this film for the Spiderman franchise is roughly what Endgame is for the Avengers. A movie with big stakes, lots of action and lots of characters. It lasted two and a half hours, but at no point was it boring. It was definitely made for the fans because it has a lot of scenes and references to the franchise, perhaps this is best seen by the initial reactions and reviews that are extremely good and the ratings that are currently perhaps too high for a film like this.I've always been a big fan of Spiderman, ever since the 1990s when I read comics and watched cartoons as a child and later through Raimi's first films in the early 2000s. I will not lie, this film is a great fun, loud, nostalgic, but also emotional ride, I especially enjoyed the last third of the film because of every event, scene and dialogue that took place until the very end. It is a full of fan service, it even used to bother me a bit, but as I said, the last third of the film paid off for everything.And the flaws, I would point out that there are too many characters in the film, so it was not easy to balance the time that some got in the film. I must also point out the downside of modern times, and that is that it was impossible for me to avoid spoilers as much as I tried, through trailers that in my opinion reveal a little too much as well as through various speculations and statements on the internet. Unfortunately, that spoiled my impression a bit, which would have been definitely stronger if I didn't know anything about this film.The trilogy ended with the best and highest quality film, and that is something that very rarely happens. I'm just wondering in which direction the franchise will go now."

Following on from the excellent Far From Home comes a film that dials back the comedy and ups the drama, and in that regards it feels somewhat like the older Spider-Man films. The action scenes are great... for the most part, although the final battle is a bit of a mess with quick cuts and A LOT happening. Alfred Molina is great as Doc Ock, but Willem Dafoe utterly steals the show reprising his Green Goblin role, and is even better here than he was in Spider-Man (2002). All in all its all very Marvel formula 101, with amazing effects, some in jokes and a very, very interesting mid-credits scene.

It's the result of a very good fusion. It is not Marvel or Sony, it's the sum of both and the result of a memorable union.Despite being pure fanservice, the film successfully delivers a plot full of action, emotions, and nostalgia, making this last concept its main weapon of attack on an eager and incisive audience to re-fill movie theaters and fill the empty spaces in his conspiracy theories regarding the actual making of the film.The framework where the story takes place joins the epicity of the multiversal concept, which will be groped ad nauseam through the genre. Great action sequences, violent confrontations above the normal in previous films and justified emotions that feel like a goodbye and also a new beginning.Unfortunately not everything is perfect. There were situations too convenient for the development of the plot. Overly simple explanations and solutions that are only justified in a superhero movie. There are some weird editing jumps, but they don't affect the pacing of the film, which by the way, was inconsistent at times. Lastly, there were certain characters appearances that exist just to meet expectations and serve no general purpose.Still, all things considered, it feels like a good arachnid movie. The protagonist has managed to mature his character in a good way and feels one of his best performances in the role.Recommended for those who follow the entire Marvel storyline, even outside of the MCU."

But MCU has managed to succeeded to conclude their Spider-Man trilogy. Spider-Man: No Way Home is close to be another one of my favorite MCU films. We've seen Peter Parker enter the MCU films even though he was owned by Sony. And yet, the movie has given the level of charm that sets the universe, including with the additions of the villains we know in the Spider-Man universe. And that makes the story a lot bigger than the previous two, along with the characters that both prove how we care for them and great additions that really work for the film. And of course, the visuals are incredibly crafted with both the costumes and the creativity from Strange Magic's powers. This is an absolute must watch for MCU films that have waited for this film.

But this third solo movie is his best film to date, one of the most impactful MCU & Superhero movies and one outing that redeems and answers all my complaints regarding what came before.Here, MCU's Peter Parker finally shows some cracks and faces true trauma, developing a true commitment to his own adventure even being extremely populated by plenty of beloved and nostalgic other ones. Here, Parker's Spider-Man finally gets to grown in me, being faithful to the source and ending his evolution within Avengers universe on a riprousingly high. The performances are really strong, the script covers its plotholes & weaknesses with energy, tragedy and fun so well mixed and the ending looks like a true ending to Holland's Spider-Man trilogy.An excellent entertainment and a shocking surprise.

There is much to scrutinize about the rules and world-building consistency here (even if we ignore the three different film universes it needs to stay congruent with, the plot on its own has some holes), but in terms of pay-off and fanservice -- in its most genuine, loving kind -- it is absolutely wondrous.For an MCU movie, it's also remarkably well-shot and well-acted. Tom Holland and Zendaya have better chemistry here than ever before, Alfred Molina and Willem Dafoe are utterly wonderful as their classic Spider-Man baddies, Jamie Foxx's character from the Garfield era is vastly improved, and Marisa Tomei gets some genuinely tear-jerking moments. I didn't feel strongly about Benedict Cumberbatch in this movie (least of all his cringe-tacular Scooby-Doo quip), but rest assured, you will see him elsewhere on my list.As nonsensical as some of the story beats are when you muse upon in-universe logistics even one little bit, this might just be the most emotionally strong out of all the MCU flicks thus far.

""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" turned into the next Endgame, with one of the most surprising twists and turns. Not that this is Tom Holland's last Spider-Man movie, but this will be his best Spider-Man movie. No Way Home is one of the Best Marvel Superhero Movie of all time! No spoilers for this movie tho, but I can only say one thing that comes to mind. This movie is definitely ""A MUST SEE Superhero movie of the year!""

I was thinking this latest/biggest movie, looked like it was maybe a bit too rammed with badguys. But even some of its most questionable parts really pay off. Making for another ace adventure.There really is alot going on in the movie and casual viewers could be overwhelmed. But at its core its all still centred around Tom Hollands spiderman. As it should be. And he really steals the show from all the additional characters.There are of course lots of great jokes. Including the series making fun of some of its earlier stuff. There are alot of villians, but they're all returning characters, so don't feel underused. More like they're getting some extra time to shine. There maybe is still one too many though. It's all building up to a big finale. Where things maybe do go a bit overboard, and I got lost. But it all feels epic, and like a really huge event for fans and everyone else, so all worth it.I wasn't sure I liked some of the stuff going on with the ending at first. But thinking about it afterwards. The fans are just going to continue getting what they want here. Especially after the awesome mid credits scene."

The young hero is very much loved all over the world, and the successful Infinity Saga, which was just gaining momentum, was replenished with a famous character to please the public. Two solo albums followed, which were well received by the audience. Well, the announcement of the third film about Parker's life and his meeting with heroes from other universes raised interest in the upcoming film to the skies, perfectly playing on the fact that even fans of films with Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield will also be interested in the project. The option really turned out to be a win-win, while giving the audience another high-quality story.The plot plot, however, looks kind of ridiculous, implicates Doctor Strange here. The magician and the magician reacts to Peter's request, in my opinion, somehow not in an adult way. But we all understand that if the magician had refused the young Spider, the story would not have happened at all (although everything is difficult here because of other projects, including Loki and Wanda/ Vision). Nevertheless, a certain solution triggers a chain of events that demonstrate a lot of interesting content on the screen.It cannot be said that the film was created exclusively for fans. The story is strong and allows Tom Holland's Peter Parker to grow up, rising to a new level. The dramatic events that meet the audience during the narration necessarily affect the personality of the young Spider, perfectly demonstrating that he will have to answer for any of his decisions on his own. He is no longer a teenager, and the stakes are high, often it's human lives. And if you have decided to act the way you acted, then be ready to answer for the consequences, even if it hurt your heart unbearably.This film shows well who and how of the characters moves further along their storyline. There are a lot of heroes and villains here, whose fate is really interesting to know. Well, the great trinity will definitely make you not only smile, but also worry about the fate of everyone, especially in the finale of the story. Viewers will see a reverent and respectful attitude towards the previous Spider-Man franchises. The presented characters will tell how they lived at a time that we have not been able to see on the screen, they will tell, it seems, everything that is needed to ensure that the audience has a general picture of their worlds.However, do not forget that this is still a film about the current Spider-Man. The picture will be focused on it. Holland has surpassed himself in terms of acting. A young man together with his hero turns from a teenager into a young man who is ready to live as an adult and independent person, having left the custody of older comrades. Finally, you begin to understand that in future tapes he will no longer need mentors, such as Tony Stark, Nick Fury, Happy Hogan or Stephen Strange. And after the end credits, you catch yourself thinking that the trilogy about the guy that happened is just the teenage period of Spider-Man. And the potential of his individual future stories is very great.""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" has become a great blockbuster. It has everything you need for a successful movie. The stars have converged. The successful, but recently stalling Marvel cinematic universe has given fans of the past and present a really worthwhile project. The creators have successfully entered into their Fourth phase about the Multiverse a strong project that is directly related to it, and also thanks to an uncomplicated plot gave the world the opportunity to plunge into the past and see the heroes and villains they have loved for a long time, literally breathing new life into long-familiar images. All this made it possible to earn an excellent box office, prepare the ground for future projects about Spider-Man, and, most importantly, reminded and even taught young viewers important things. It is necessary to be responsible for every adult independent decision. Take it on your shoulders, learn from mistakes and understand that every person has them, even if it's Spider-Man.After all, ""the greater the power, the greater the responsibility.""8 out of 10."

They spider and termite scamperd on after herd and eventually joined a large crowd of people watching herd doing the splits in front of a church. The hampster had stayed back and we saw him open his breifcase and stare at the contents (about 3lbs of silver with a horse drawn into it). Im not sure what that signified. Later we see the hampster smoking a long cigarette rolled from a piece of notebook paper, he also breakes a glowing cain on a usps mailbox (i didnt get it).

It finishes his origin arc in which now he really seems to be on his own and is really his own hero.Starting off, it starts off from the mid credits scene of Far From Home, so it is good to have watched that one before this one. It can give a good understanding to the mid credits scene that this movie starts on.This is the first time in film where Spider-Man's secret identity is revealed to the world. That is a big reason why this movie was so hyped and good overall. With the MCU having magic canon, Peter tries to use that to solve that issue. No matter what you say about that detail and it not making sense, if it didn't happen, we wouldn't have the movie.This movie uses the multiverse to really help move Peter's story. It brings in the villains of the previous two live action Spider-Man franchises to give him a challenge. He wanted to give them a second change, with it ending with Peter developing more as a character.A lot of this movie's popularity relies on fan service. It brings in the fans of the other live action Spider-Men into the Tom Holland led Spider-Man movie. Even with the fan service, it really developed a well made story. It is a pretty emotional story to satisfy Spider-Man fans of many kinds."

This movie could have easily clocked in at two hours and feel like the perfect blockbuster movie. But no. After the finale, the ""good byes"" stretch on and on. Then of course there is baiting for other upcoming MCU movies. Even the fun jokey jokey scenes that are the hallmark of this franchise get cringe-worthy sometimes. I still give this movie a thumbs up, because it took a concept and found some fun with it. There is a little bit of manipulation, with more than a few tear jerker scenes (really? How many times do you need to push the waterworks?). But the biggest thing this movie has going for it is re-thinking the villains. Instead of the villains arriving and being bad guys, we find a way to make them sympathetic, and the audience will go along with the alternate storyline.I also like Benedict Cumberbatch. He fares well as a secondary character that only appears in the movie every once in a while. At the heart of the success of this current iteration of the Spiderman franchise is the friendship, particularly MJ and Ned. They stay integral to the center of the story quite intentionally, so you feel this is more of an ensemble piece that the previous two movies. However, the expected fan service (rumors are true) takes over and becomes the twist in the story. The concept of multiple universes has been pushed by Marvel for the last couple years, and here it is used as a vehicle for conflicts that arise.So I enjoyed the story, the treatment of the villains, plus the high buck action scenes we expect, and the supporting characters. For that reason, I will declare this film is the best of the three. Just get ready for some tugs at the heart in the third act, where you may find yourself getting a little annoyed that another music cue (the solitary piano notes with the sad violin) is making you well up again.I will give this a 7 out of 10, despite the extra half-hour of hugging."

The introduction of Doctor Strange, played by Benedict Cumberbatch, adds a layer of magical complexity to the narrative. The botched spell that opens the multiverse is a pivotal moment, setting the stage for the film's most iconic encounters.The introduction of the multiverse opens up a world of possibilities for visual storytelling. The Mirror Dimension, a visually stunning alternate reality, is a standout example of the film's creative use of special effects. The fight sequences involving multiple Spider-Men are a spectacle of choreography and coordination, with each character bringing their unique fighting style to the screen.The arrival of villains from alternate universes, including Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus, Electro, Sandman, and Lizard, is a fan's dream come true. Willem Dafoe's portrayal of Green Goblin is particularly chilling, capturing the character's menacing and chaotic nature. The film's exploration of these characters' motivations and their redemption arcs adds depth and complexity to the story.The film's action sequences are both thrilling and inventive. The battle against the Green Goblin, with his iconic pumpkin bombs, is a nostalgic yet updated take on classic Spider-Man villains.The final battle is a spectacle of epic proportions, with multiple Spider-Men facing off against a formidable array of villains. The emotional weight of the moment is palpable, as Peter sacrifices everything to save those he cares about.

7,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7664440/?ref_=tturv_perm_269,Spider-Man: No way of not eating your cake too. 72.5%?,,3,11,dfle3,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur4025773/?ref_=tturv_usr_269_t,20-Dec-21,"Following on the from the ending of the previous film in this series, ""Spider-Man: Far from home"" (which I've reviewed here), where the identity of Spider-Man is revealed to the world, we see Peter Parker/Spider-Man wish that that wasn't the case. As they say, be careful of what you wish for. Dr. Strange has some unkind words to say about Parker in the aftermath of this but what's that saying about people who live in glass houses? Did Peter subject the good Doctor to peer pressure to get what he wanted? Did Strange want to be one of the ""cool kids"" by giving Peter what he wanted? Anyway, bad things happen as a result and they need to be fixed. Apparently granting people their wish allows illegal aliens without the correct documentation to enter from multiverses into our own world.As I said in my review for the previous film (not having the seen the one prior to that, which was the 3rd reboot of the Spider-Man franchise, I believe), I didn't find it a satisfying film until near the end and that ending made me curious to see the next entry, which I've done. It's déjà vu all over again this time, as whilst I didn't find that this new film was as bad as the previous one was (for the most part), it did end in such a way that I was sort of curious to see the next entry in the series as well as the other MCU films which are promoted in the closing credits. These are the kinds of film that I don't really feel happy about paying top dollar to see them at the cinema. If there was a day of the week where you could watch a film cheaply at the cinema, it could be do-able for me. Cheaper than that. I'd settle for seeing it on the non-commercial ABC TV network in Australia, or a summary of the happenings in a Tweet.""Spider-Man: No way home"" is better for not having that 'awkward teenage romance' aspect of the previous film but the way that it dealt with Peter Parker's identity as Spider-Man being revealed just didn't grab me. Maybe I would have preferred a more domestic focus on the impact this has on Peter but then again, maybe the way that it is handled in the film is fair enough. After that stuff is resolved - and I'm not even sure that it is resolved in a way that makes sense, as in it makes sense why Parker is no longer a hunted target - the film focuses on providing fan service to long-time devotees of this character's forays into film. You'll see familiar villains return as a result of Parker's wish, which he'll have to deal with in one way or another.I might have mentioned in a previous review for a Spider-Man film or elsewhere online that I thought it was ridiculous how many reboots this franchise has had in such a short space of time. Maybe I should have waited for the next actor to play Spider-Man to find one that I can enjoy an entire series of films with? Maybe this whole ""multiverse"" conceit makes that more possible? E.g. You could have dozens of Spider-Man films being released each year with different actors in all of them. Anyway, it's ironic that multiverse 'logic' has the post facto effect of making all those previous iterations of Spider-Man seem as some sort of 'grand plan' by Marvel Studios. With these kinds of fantasies I like to imagine that the superhero inhabits OUR world. With the multiverse, it's a case of: ""Oh, so we're watching a film set in some OTHER universe"". If I was to see a new actor play Spider-Man in the future and it had the conceit of being set in our world (until a later sequel?), it would devalue the story of the Spider-Man in this film (S-M:NWH) being OUR Spider-Man.That being said, I think that long-time devotees of this cinematic character will enjoy the fan service that this film provides. When this happens, some of the exchanges between characters are fun and you're glad that those questions are asked or whatever. However, I do feel that the writers could have spent a bit more time thinking about what kinds of conversations could have been had and writing those down, perhaps in a quieter setting too, so that the viewer could dwell on them. Years ago I said on an online forum or somewhere that I wondered if or why Peter Parker didn't weave a 'brown web of justice', referring to the physiology of spiders. That topic gets brought up in this film, albeit less crudely than I put it.How to score this film? I'd say that I was leaning on a score of 70% but the fan service later on in the film made me decide on 72.5%. However, with these kinds of films, I think that my scores which are around the 70% mark might be more like a professional critic's 60% score. In that case, maybe I should score this film 65% (but 6 out of 10 stars on IMDB) or 65+% (to get 7 out of 10 stars on this site according to my scoring system)? Take your pickNotes to self:* There's an 'interesting' scene where a surprise visitor meets Ned's mum (?) and they recognise one another, it seems to me. My question is: what effect does that have on the 'reality' of the world we are seeing? Does it even make sense anymore? If they do recognise each other, then looks like a logical loophole, it seems to me, in the film's world-building. The same sequence has another inexplicable moment, when someone says ""They're not your friends"" and action ensues. I have no idea what that was all about either.* There's a line in the closing credits which reads something like: ""Avi Arad the original true believer"". I see that that person is the executive producer of this film so it would be interesting to know the background to that assertion.* I'm not so personally invested in this series to get excited about some of the surprises that this film had in store but it didn't sound like anyone else in the cinema was that much of a superfan either to get THAT excited. However, I do concede that I found some of those moments of interaction to have emotional gravity which was well conveyed by the actors concerned."

There's no denying that. Ever since this movie's announcement, you knew this was a bigger deal than the usual superhero flicks. And being a movie with such high expectations, means that there's so much room for things to go wrong. And unfortunately... It seems like it did.Now I'm fresh out of the theatre, and I already feel like this movie had so much potential wasted. A sentiment I also share towards Avengers Endgame; where the only thing the writers seemed to worry about was 'fan-service'. Fan service is fine honestly, but the line should be when fan-service slowly starts taking over for storytelling. Because the storytelling in this movie was childish.Don't get me wrong... I enjoyed the movie... I enjoyed the theatre experience... It was fun... But fun is not enough when you realize what could have been. Spiderman: No Way Home could have been Marvel's most ambitious project yet, but it has the curse of Marvel's horrible writing staff who similarly messed up everything from Avengers Endgame, to WandaVision, to Falcon and the Winter Soldier, to Loki and to Black Widow. The plot of the movie sounds like some cheap fan fiction that somehow got made. And what's even worse is its absolutely cringe worthy dialogue; existing for the sole purpose of reminding the audience of previous Spiderman movies. It's such a dumb and convenient plot that just exists for the sake of nostalgia.I loved Avengers Infinity War and I really enjoyed Spiderman Far From Home, but I haven't enjoyed a single Marvel project since, because all their projects have been so shallow with no real substance to back itself up. Marvel has a writing problem that needs to be looked into, for the sake of cinema and storytelling.What a missed opportunity... What an absolutely missed opportunity..."

This movie is a dream for all Spidey fans and it has reached beyond our expectations. What a movie!!!Seriously no words to say just gonna say one thing go to the theatres and watch it for yourself. Because you don't know what's marvel/sony has stored for you. From the start till the end the movie keeps you engaging in every aspects. It has action, emotions & a lot of surprises. Tom just nailed his role. Superb performance by him & all other cast. Visuals & bgm are outstanding. Story was not that new but you can deal with it. Don't miss the credit scenes because it has extra surprises....."

But Tom Holland has truly elevated the web-slinger to another level (or should I say universe) with a stunning performance in No Way Home that is not just an immensely satisfying film for MCU fans but also great cinema.As revealed in the trailer, Peter Parker goes into a panic after Mysterio reveals his identity to the world. He approaches Doctor Strange to cast a spell to undo the same, only for the Sorcerer Supreme's attempt to bend the multiversal divides, bringing all sorts of beings from other worlds into the MCU-verse.The witty banter between Peter, MJ and Ned continues to be the bedrock of the franchise and director Jon Watts and writers Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers never lose focus on that despite the immense source material and astronomic fan expectations they were given to manage.Enter Alfred Molina as Dock Ock, Willem Defoe as the Green Goblin and a menagerie of the greatest villains of the Spiderverse converging on New York to turn Peter Parker's world upside down. Dafoe is the greatest living actor not to win an Oscar and the seasoned thespian delivers a jaw-dropping performance as the cult antagonist, becoming the perfect counterweight to Holland's compelling lead performance.Zendaya, Benedict Cumberbatch and Marisa Tomei deliver heart-touching performances to really elevate the film, which also features some of the most imaginative and cutting-edge CGI work the MCU has ever seen. Surprise cameos and guest appearances generate whistle-worthy moments in the theatre and this is one movie you definitely don't want to miss watching on the big screen.The fact that the writers managed to tie in easter eggs from Wanda Vision, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, Loki and even Hawkeye and set up things for upcoming Phase 4 villains while bringing in a completely difference Marvel-verse from a competing studio (no points for guessing) is nothing short of sheer brilliance.Despite the enormous set of content threads and characters director Jon Watts had to work with, he ably ensures each one gets requisite screen space and enough depth to make every performance in the film a memorable one.Ultimately, No Way Home is a fitting third act to the best Spiderman trilogy ever made. The villains continue to be what defines the classy MCU movies from the rest. While Tony Leung in Shang Chi and Willem Dafoe in No Way Home shone and captivated audiences, the fact that the Black Widow and Eternals did not resonate as much with audiences can be directly attributed to their lack of well-written, impactful antagonists.The villain-building should reach another level as we head deeper into Marvels Phase 4 with Oscar-nominee Chiwetel Ejiofor expanding on 'Karl Mordo' in Doctor Strange: Multiverse of Madness and Jonathan Majors returning as 'Kang the Conqueror' in Ant Man: Quantumania. But it is going to be Oscar winner Christian Bale's entry into the MCU as 'Gorr the God Butcher' in Thor: Love and Thunder that I am most looking forward to, combined with director Taika Waikiti's eccentric writing.No Way Home is a monumental piece of filmmaking and the best of the Marvel Phase 4 movies so far. Highly, highly recommended!"

What the hell was I smoking as a 13 year old), or as a stupid adult who can at least laugh at how bad that film is.And although there are a hell of a lot of member berries all over this film, there genuinely is a narrative reason for it and I don't think they could have told quite the same story without doing that. And anyway, as far as I know, the concept of a multiverse in Spider-Man is far from a new thing, and are you really going to complain about seeing more of Alfred Molina as Doc Ock or Willem Dafoe as Green Goblin? Cause I'm certainly not.Especially not when all the villains feel like they've stepped right out of the sets of their respective other films without having aged a day. Except Electro, which is good because he sucked and they made him better. There are some slightly odd changes made to them, like Electro's design is completely different, Sandman never appears as human, he's just constantly a man-shaped pile of sand, and I couldn't help but think they did something to Lizard's face (haven't seen his film in years though, don't just take my word for that).But once you get past that, it really does do justice to all of them, and even though they all have their lines that do feel more like they're coming from an MCU writer than something they would have actually said, it's just so much goddamn fun seeing them all together.And it does all the returning characters really well, too, especially Peter, who gets by far my favourite arc of this trilogy, and Tom Holland absolutely killed it as ever. In fact, everyone did, and for anyone who complains that Spider-Man 3 or TASM 2 was bad because they had ""too many villains"", well this ought to shut them up. It has almost double the amount of villains and is still really well put together. The problem with those other films is they had too many studios messing around with the story, not too many villains.And by the end of the film, I really felt like something with serious consequences had happened, and like from here, it really could go in any direction imaginable.And yeah, the directing is a little bit bland (although I'd consider it a step up from Homecoming and Far From Home nonetheless), and there is the odd cringey joke like in all of these films, and sometimes it does get a little too far up its own ass with all the callbacks, and I can certainly imagine this being the kind of story that has a boatload of plot holes I haven't really thought about yet, but despite all that, it's easily one of my favourite MCU films to date.And I'm at least 95% sure it had nothing to do with the nostalgia, because I saw this with my girlfriend who has never seen a Spider-Man film before and doesn't really care much for superheroes at all, and she liked it even more than I did. So if you're not going to trust me, someone who amuses himself by quoting Green Goblin lines on a weekly basis, trust her, who needed an explanation of who everyone was when they appeared and still loved it.Or trust the audience I saw it with, because holy crap I've never heard an audience so noticeably loving what they're watching as I did with this."

After that shocking cliffhanger from the previous movie and the fact that villains from both Sam Raimi's Spiderman trilogy and The Amazing Spider-Man were returning for multiverse madness, the hype went through the roof. However, does it live up to the hype or collapse under its weight?Let's get the obvious praises out the way first. The action sequences are all still very exciting and enjoyable to watch. The fight scenes utilize Spidey's and the villains' ability very well leading to a very fun choreography. Although, my favourite fight happens to just be a brutal fistfight in an apartment that illustrate the new tonal direction of the film. Michael Giacchino returns to score the film and his music score is better than ever. The first half of the film has a similar music score to that of Spider-Man Homecoming and Far From Home. The second half is where Michael's music score starts feeling more sombre and heroic, which is very effective and fitting for the story. He also includes some subtle music soundtrack from Sam Raimi's Spider-Man and The Amazing Spider-Man that is very fitting. One complaint that I had about director Jon Watts is that his Spider-Man movies are not visually interesting. This isn't the case in No Way Home with there being good cinematography and memorable shots. There is a scene with Strange and magic that looks visually pleasing and a scene with Peter in the rain that looks stunning.Tom Holland is still phenomenal as Spider-Man with him delivering a great performance. His chemistry with both Jacob Batalon and Zendaya who play Peter's best friend and girlfriend respectively is a wonderful sight. Seeing the three of them work together like the best of friends feels very believable. Benedict Cumberbatch also returns as Doctor Strange and he gives a very different side to him that we haven't seen before. He gives a more playful yet lecturing father-like side to him that bounces well off Spider-Man. Alfred Molina returns after 17 years as Doctor Octopus from Spider-Man 2 and he is still able to embody the character perfectly like he never left. The best performance in this film comes from Willem Dafoe who returns as the Green Goblin From Spider-Man (2002). Willem is somehow able to give a performance that is even more frightening and unhinged than his performance in 2002 Spider-Man. Jamie Foxx also returns as Electro and thankfully his performance is no longer as cringy or silly as it was in The Amazing Spider-Man 2. This time he does feel like a villain to be reckoned with.The story is also a huge step up from the previous MCU Spider-Man movies as it feels like there is more emotional weight this time. One issue with MCU Spider-Man over previous Spider-Man movies is that Peter never has anything personal at stake. This isn't the case in No Way Home where it feels like he is dealing with a lot and even downright suffering for it. He has a proper story arc that is incredibly satisfying. One worry I had was the fact there were 5 villains in this movie. Surprisingly, the movie does a good job of juggling them all. Everyone has a fair amount of dialogue that illustrates their personality while clearly stating their motives for them being against Spider-Man. Even if their motive is just wanting to turn a city into lizards.Unfortunately, Lizard and Sandman don't get as much focus compared to the other three villains. Both do feel like they are just there to have a big CGI battle at the end. I also find Sandman's motive clashes with the other villains which makes it weird for him to be teaming up with them at all. No Way Home also still seems to have a problem that a lot of MCU movies have which is doing quips and jokes without letting the serious nature of the moment linger longer. The film also has some weird editing where it feels like they don't linger on an actor's facial performance for long enough and just cut away to someone else's reaction instead. There are also a fair amount of scenes done with close up camera shots instead of a long or wide shot even though it would be better. Both of these are very noticeable in the final act, most likely due to the studio filming these actors in different places.Overall, Spider-Man No Way Home might be the best MCU Spider-Man film so far. While it is certainly filled to the brim with fan service, the film is still able to maintain a compelling story while making the fan service complement the story. This film should've been a bloated mess and it should have crushed under its weight, but it didn't. While the film certainly has flaws (and some plot holes and plot conveniences), it never damages the experience. No Way Home is an excellent movie that lives up to the hype. This is how you do fan service properly!"

First, for such a youth-oriented movie, the only cool characters are two of the adults, Dr Strange and Aunt May.Second, the idea of a multiverse may be the single most damaging addition to Hollywood formulae since John Schuck uttered the F word in M*A*S*H, kicking prudes to the curb (good) but ushering in decades of lazy writing (bad). I had hoped Everything Everywhere All At Once would be the stupidest-ever use of the multiverse, because the hypothesis was wasted on the result: a chick flick, with Mom and daughter reconciling.

The first two film Homecoming and Far From Home were good but not close to the level of Sam Raimi's first two Spider-Man films. The two Amazing Spider-Man films with Andrew Garfield were ok but just didn't connect with me. The two MCU Spider-Man films with Tom Holland were a step in the right direction but also just weren't that memorable. With Tom Holland as Peter Parker/Spider-Man they went back to a younger, goofier vibe. Both films were very funny but not great superhero films. More comedy than action with some stakes and emotion.With a sort of messy first act No Way Home finally gave me the Spider-Man film I was waiting for. With what has become a staple of Marvel films it changes from very light and jokey to kind of dark at times. The story is very high concept with what most everybody knows from the trailers are appearances by characters from other Spider-Man films. I was worried that this would be just a gimmick and the characters would be just quick cameos but they are truly part of the story and are all given their moments. Benedict Cumberbatch as Doctor Strange is good and has a good chemistry with Tom Holland. The relationship between Peter Parker and his girlfriend MJ and Ned are central again here. Both Zendaya and Jacob Batalon are really good in their roles. Tom Holland is finally given a chance to BE Spider-Man. In the other two films he's done he was really good as Peter. Funny and awkward. But also unsure as Spider-Man. This time he really grows into the role and it great to see. The action scenes are really good but the most important thing is that I cared about what was happening on the screen. The fact that so many characters were brought back could have been a disaster but because it's more than just fan service and they are given good screen time it works well. The audience I was watching the film in was really into it. Alot if cheering. I missed that in the last almost 2 years. Watching a big blockbuster in a full theater. It was fun.The last couple of Marvel films haven't been that good. With Spider-Man: No Way Home Marvel gets back on track. In my opinion it is up there with the better MCU entries.Grade: A-"

The arrival of the villains injected a sense of excitement, making the movie much more enjoyable despite my initial concerns about the pacing and exposition. The superstar entrances and fan service were expected but still added a delightful touch, and the witty banter, while occasionally feeling forced, contributed to the overall fun.While the movie follows the MCU's reliable formula and occasionally relies on multiverse elements, No Way Home successfully captures the essence of a Spider-Man movie. The latter part of the film, although embracing predictable beats, is executed with confidence and delivers the familiar satisfaction that comes with well-established storylines. The performances of certain actors, whom I won't spoil, are particularly noteworthy and add depth to the narrative.It's refreshing to see an MCU Spider-Man film that boldly embraces its identity as a Spider-Man movie. In its best moments, No Way Home delves into Peter Parker's history, his struggles, and the enduring selflessness that defines his character. The movie manages to explore emotional complexity despite adhering to some Marvel tropes, providing a satisfying experience for both longtime fans and newcomers alike."

K. Simmons return as ""J Jonah Jameson"" in a new media role.This movie made me realise what's been missing from cinemas during this pandemic...people!Live audiences are part of the big screen experience that you can't get at home with your family and friends.Their reaction to the introduction of certain characters and references and memes to previous movies in the Spider verse made the movie jump off the screen and into the aisles.There are so many surprises for you that I don't want to spoil any of them.Suffice to say ""No Way Home"" is like a Jukebox playing the greatest hits of the Marvel Cinema Universe for heroes and villains.The script ranges from hilarious at times, but also will move you to tears during the drama and pathos.The fight scenes have to be seen to be believed especially on an iconic Bridge and at a famous New York landmark.This film marks the first MCU trilogy to be directed by the same director, Jon Watts.All previous film franchises like Iron Man & Captain America had only two consistent directors throughout their trilogies.Do NOT leave before the end credits, where you get an Easter Egg and a trailer for an upcoming movie.Both lay out vital clues for future films in the MCU.Come get some Superhero action in a Multi-verse that will blow your mind."

Well, here goes!From the previews we know Peter has been outed and he seeks help from his work colleague, Stephen Strange. Well, that's not even an appetiser to what's in store throughout this fast-paced, action-packed, awe-inspiring, romance. Yes, romance!This film isn't about revenge, retribution nor retaliation. It is simply about love in all its forms. A complex emotion to visualise, hence the marketing gurus invented roses, diamonds and Mother's Day to define it, but love is like the COVID virus- it fluctuates, changes and adapts in many different environments!Peter's love for MJ, his aunt, his best friend, his powers, his Avengers friends are all different, yet still called 'love'. Well, through comic book metaphors 'love' has broken barriers, dimensions and heaps of hearts in No Way Home.Only in understanding that 'love' is a main character in this tribute can you comprehend the title and its deepest meaning.The acting complements the seamless and jaw-dropping CGI, Special Effects and Stunts. So in tune are they that you forget some things you saw weren't real!Peter's journey, although not yet complete, has definitely been through the wringers! All of Spider-man's incarnations have had their share of moral dilemmas, and yet this film surpasses all previous choices and redeems the actions of a true hero: one that puts other's wellbeing above their own. And if that is not love, I am perplexed as to what is!The only reason I gave it a 9 is because it lost a point for just bringing the boys back to play- no exes in sight!!The future of the MCU just took a turn that this avid fan anticipates will be even more majestic than it's reliance on an evil mastermind in its previous incarnations had achieved! I, for one, cannot wait for more!"

Even in Spider Man 2, he was far more developed than the other characters.Doctor Strange is awesome as always and I cannot wait to see him in The Multiverse of Madness.Oh and a certain cup that says ""We are happy to serve you."" will always make me tear up now.

I didn't know what to expect, but I certainly expected better than what I saw. Besides being a snooze fest, it was so sappy and saccharin I scheduled a dentist visit during the movie.The movie started going wayward the moment Peter Parker (Tom Holland) went to Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) for a spell to make everyone forget him. It wasn't a bad idea for Peter to go to Doctor Strange to fix his little revealed-identity problem, it was just oddly dumb of Doctor Strange to actually accommodate Peter. Doctor Strange truly attempted to make everyone in the world forget who Peter Parker was. It was a massive spell that seemed very excessive just to fix one man's problems. The movie went into silly mode as Parker kept interrupting Doctor Strange as he was doing the spell. The result was a host of old nemeses from different universes converging upon this universe to find Parker. If it was explained, it was explained poorly.At this point the movie was on shaky ground, but it hadn't given way. ""No Way Home"" would suffer another setback when Parker fought Strange to prevent him from sending all of these villains back to their respective universes. You see, if they were to go back then they'd meet death at the hands of, or because of, that universe's Spider-Man, and this universe's Spider-Man was way too moralistic to allow that to happen. No, Parker would fix it so that they could all go back home and they could all live happily ever after.Everything after this part of the movie was immaterial to me in the grand scheme. For me, when a plot is based upon a faulty or simply bad premise, everything that follows is equally faulty and meaningless. Not that the things that follow can't be cool aesthetically; they're just empty.Parker was operating upon the righteous advice of his Aunt May (Marisa Tomei). Per her wisdom, Parker had an obligation to help these poor misguided men, no matter what the exponentially more knowledgeable Doctor Strange said. Doctor Strange wanted to do the most logical thing which was send each villain back to his own universe and let fate take over from there. Parker, with his oversized heart and undersized common sense, wanted to keep them in his own universe as pet projects until he could fix them, then send them back. Nevermind that he was going to be actively tampering with the course of events of another universe thereby massively altering their timelines with untold consequences, he simply wasn't old enough, wise enough, or experienced enough to know what was the best thing to do. Furthermore, it was a slap in the face of the other Spider-Men. As if to say, ""You guys screwed up, I'm going to find a better, more wholesome solution because I'm a better Spider-Man""I was so thoroughly perturbed by this new mission of Spider-Man's to save these villains that everything after that began to annoy me. The attempts at comedy were awkward and grossly unfunny. The emotional moments were too often and too long. The final nail in the coffin of this was the runtime. Boy did they drag this out. I could put up with a didactic and flawed plot if you get us through it in a quick and exciting way, but in their attempts to have this grand send off for Spider-Man we had to suffer through an ocean of tears, a chasm of emotions, and an abundance of silence with slow music. I left the theater drained and upset as though I'd just been to the DMV. Everything was set up for them to reboot Spider-Man if needed, but at this point I could use a break and no more Spider-Men about ""home."""

The appearance of characters from previous Spider-Man versions was also talked about by everyone even a year before the release. The influence of the media and social networks also took away the effort of the film crew to create surprises for the audience. Many fans of the characters from more than 20 years ago also created uncontrollable excitement. I know it's crazy. Many people say this movie is like fan service. I don't disagree. As someone who has experienced all the live-action versions of Spider-Man since I was a child, I completely understand the feelings of the people involved. Honestly, nothing makes me feel more satisfied than seeing 3 spiderman swinging together. That scene is really cool. My teenage heart would want to give those scenes a 10/10. But I want to judge the movie rationally. Obviously the idea of the multiverse is pretty potential and has a lot of scientific concepts to break down. But it's not explicitly stated here. Peter has a problem, he asks Doctor Strange for help, he makes a mistake, and he fixes it. That's it. The characters from previous versions of Spider-Man just show up and cause trouble and then disappear after the problem is solved in the original way. The whole world forgetting who Peter is is dramatized as the ultimate loss. I don't think it's that terrible. If a few characters died, or Peter had to leave Earth, it would at least be considered a loss. Why do I say that? Because not only in this movie, but also in the two previous parts of Spider-Man Tom, we get to experience the story of a happy Spider-Man without seeing him confide in his loved ones and tell them how important they are to him. Aunt May's death didn't feel like enough emotional weight. And while the CGI provided some great action, it didn't really hit the emotional climax. Of course I appreciate the performances of Willem Dafoe and Alfred Molina, their performances are top-notch. But I wanted a story that was a little more plot-twisted, a little more complicated, a little more serious and intense."

Thanks to Disney, the bright images, especially when you see Dr. Strange scenes (no spoilers!), completely uses the whole screen with a little of chopping the picture. The images are larger than life, but they don't confuse the eye or strain the vision of the audience. Being able to pull it off with extraordinarily daring stunt work - augmented by gritty CGI and sentiments is simply awe-inspiring!It may have taken almost 20 years, 9 movies, 3 different lead actors, 2 reboots but Spidey has finally shown redemption. This new trilogy places emotions without unnecessary drama and brings new dimensions. This time it has a string of sentiments sizzling its screenplay. Finally you see real drama, just like Nolan showed us in the Dark Knight Trilogy!Spiderman is not just a teenage boy but can Strange convince him or not? In the trailer, he mentions ""everyone will forget you are Peter Parker!"" The question is: Can Spider-man carry his own weight in the near future without the Avengers?

He's always given great performances and he is undoubtably the most comic accurate version of the character but my recurring issue with Spider Man in the MCU is that he just never seems to be able to fully stand on his own. Both of his solo films heavily revolve around Tony Stark and in his other appearances he's been a smaller part in a larger whole. Despite all that however I was (like everyone) so excited for this film and the possibilities it could bring even if there was the risk of it relying too heavily on fan service and nostalgia as opposed to a solid story. But I have to say that this film really lived up to the hype and managed to use its fan service in the best possible manner to create for a film that was endlessly enjoyable, thrilling and surprisingly emotional.As I said, I've had my issues with this version of Peter Parker but I have to say I think he's the best he's ever been in No Way Home. I really liked how Watts and the writers didn't simply brush over the consequences of the last film. They spend a great deal of time exploring Peters life in the wake of his identity being revealed to the world and it allows you to fully understand and sympathise with his predicament before any of the fan service elements kick in. While Doctor Strange plays a key role in the film I never felt as though the film was relying on him too much. He shows up more sporadically than I was expecting and I think that ultimately worked in the films favour as it never felt as though he was showing up any more than he needed to and I didn't think they sacrificed any moments for him that should've been more about Peter. The film also ended in a way that I wasn't expecting and it was surprisingly emotional. I didn't think they kept things status quo for his character and they left things of in a way that I'm more excited than ever to see where they go with his character next.I think this film succeeds more with its characters than both of the previous Holland movies but also more than most MCU films. While Peter gets his own satisfying arc I also thought all the supporting characters got their own moments to shine. Aunt May has been a repeated source of missed opportunities in this trilogy for me but I think the character is the best she's been since the Raimi films. She gets a lot of intense, emotional scenes with Peter and actually plays a much larger part in the story than I was expecting. Her arc concludes in a very unexpected and emotional place that added a lot to this film beyond just being light and entertaining. Ned and MJ also get a lot to do in this film beyond just being funny sidekicks, their connection to Peter is what drives a lot of the story and again adds that extra layer of emotion that was sorely missing in Far From Home and quite a few other marvel films. A lot of other Spider Man films have been criticised for having too many villains and whole this film ran the risk of repeating that same mistake I ultimately felt they were all used fantastically. It's great to see so many of these actors returning to these roles and I loved that they included scenes of them interacting with one and other, they all had great chemistry and it was nice to see these vastly different characters bounced of each other. I think they all got their individual moments to shine but I do think some of them get lost in the shuffle a little bit, personally I'd like to have seen a little bit more time devoted to Sandman and Lizard.I think one of the biggest praises I can give to this film is the excellent way in which it uses fan service. I think the film did a great job of first and foremost setting up a solid story first that lent itself to that fan service well. As a result none of it really stuck out at all and instead felt like a natural part of the story they were telling. As a long time spider man fan there were many obvious moments that gave me chills but also plenty of subtle ones I picked up on and I'm sure there's plenty more to find when I watch the film again.I suppose one of my only issues with No Way Home is that it can feel a bit messy in places. The film's clearly trying to juggle a lot of plot points and characters and I think particularly the 2nd act can feel the most uneven. It just feels like it has to stall somewhat to set up all these returning characters and it did meander in places for me. I think the film also suffers from some of the recurring tropes that the MCU is known for, namely the massive use of humour that's become a staple of this franchise. I think it's because this film revolves around so many characters set up in other franchises, that some of these tropes don't always fit quite so smoothly and it does stick out as a bit forced in places. Having said that though it does use these tropes better than a lot of other marvel films and especially Far From Home which I thought sacrificed almost every single emotional or character moments for the sake of a joke.I'm so glad that No Way Home lived up to my expectations. Tom Holland's version of Spider Man is better than he's ever been, the fan service is used in appropriate ways with a good story to support it, none of the supporting characters or villains feel wasted and it ends in such a well rounded, satisfying way. It's a bit messy in places and it could've dialled back on that typical marvel humour but that doesn't take away too much from a film that is just so much fan to watch with a surprising amount of emotion. For the first time I'm actually very excited to see where this version of the web slinger goes next.9.0/10 - A (Phenomenal)"

If you have never experienced it in your life, you are about discover this wonderful feeling. I used to dislike Tom Holland's movies because of how basic and soulless they felt...No Way Home has changed that. This film actually felt like a proper Spiderman story that not only entertained but also possessed genuine heart and emotion while allowing Tom's Parker to finally live up the iconic Great Responsibility. I expected to see surprises and it was everything I hoped for and a lot more as this film provided an ecstatic superhero, and most importantly Spider-Man fulfilment.As you all saw from the trailer, Dr Strange casts a spell and boom, we have a multiverse where Spiderman facing many villains. Strangely enough, the actual film is not as simple as that because the story progresses in a most unexpected way which greatly elevates the experience without a single second being wasted. It's not just Spiderman fighting bad guys while cracking jokes. No Way Home manages to have a human side to the story where Peter deals not only with the consequences of his identity reveal, but also with things like being accepted into university and having a normal life.As Peter finds himself in an extremely difficult situation, he doesn't take the easy way out that would instantly solve his problems. Instead, he tries to make the right choice which is insurmountably more challenging and this ultimately makes him into a true hero I have admired since my childhood. Peter Parker grows and matures from being an MCU Spider-boy sidekick into a real Spider-Man.No Way Home is a marvel to behold with excellent action, creative fight sequences and awesome CGI. There is lots of on point humor with occasional references to some classic memes. Despite being crowded, every character gets a good amount of screentime with one particular villain giving an outstanding performance. What I loved most though, is the emotional weight of this film with so many beautiful moments that made me genuinely care about the story. There will be tears or sadness and tears of joy as you will bask in the grandiosity of this cinematic magic.Movies.shmovies on Instagram for movie and TV Show reviews."

The usual MCU self-references are present, but No Way Home takes a step further, acknowledging previous Spider-Man eras as its central story. Turning references into legitimate plot points deserves credit. Furthermore, the cast is truly stunning and the main selling point here. The film successfully brings all these eras together and gives everyone time to shine. Naturally, this all helps the acting too because the excellent cast clearly enjoys their roles. Add in the patented MCU filmmaking baseline, and the result is a surefire hit.However, No Way Home's gimmicks do not make a masterpiece. On a technical level, the film is still basic MCU. Occasionally, there is abstract sound and visual craft, but those aspects are mostly standard. The same goes for the editing, music, and production, which all meet (but rarely elevate) the material. Lastly, the writing and direction both get lost in the massive shuffle. This is the most epic MCU Spider-Man, and, unfortunately, the least heartfelt. The tone isn't focused and the emotional beats aren't earned. The attempts are decent, but don't resonate amongst the excitement. Nevertheless, No Way Home is certainly everything the fanboys want.Writing: 6/10

There is a fantastic idea the heart of this. Universes collide and every nemesis of Peter Parker is searching for him. Which means that the villains (and heroes) from the previous Spider-Man films end up in the current world. Willem Dafoe and Jamie Foxx in particular are fantastic in their roles.There is some unexpected tragedy in the film, and the heroes of the past spend a lot of time reflecting on their own misfortunes. This has an emotional impact but does slow the film down at key moments.There is far too much CGI (as usual) so you end up watching something closer to an animation or a video game at times, with scant regard for physics. Doing so much work in front of green screens really impacts the acting as well.The biggest issue is the superhero story itself - the bit where the good guy overcomes the bad guy. All the multiverse nonsense struggles for logic and takes a long time to set up, and Spider-Man doesn't really spend enough time fighting the bad guys at the end. The action sequences are good but they feel like an afterthought.This is a film for the fans. The neutrals (like me) may not get so much out of it."

The only thing I didn't like was the annoying end-credit rap music (uh!).Spider-Man and Doctor Strange play off each other very well here; that's refreshing after the disappointing dynamics in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (which comes later but I saw it first).Andrew Garfield (Under the Silver Lake) is an excellent actor and it was very nice to see him here.No Way Home expertly blends action and comedy, yet has strong underlying themes about responsibility (ethics versus personal tragedy).

The Spidey from the 60s or 70s would not believe his very eyes, had he seen it.But he'd love the fact that the spirit lives on even in such an estranged world.Unlike what Chris Reeves' Superman did, it's not only the memory of the beloved that'd require a forgetfulness for the hero's revelation to be erased: Lots of digital and print media around, including but not limited to J. J. Jameson's videos and columns. So, it really doesn't make sense how the ""make them forget"" thing would and does work thanks to Dr. Strange's spell. That is one giant problem there with the secret, along with several other missed opportunities on fine touches like not witnessing JJJ confront his own photographer.But, do I care? Just a little bit. Because I adored the final outcome. Not only Lee and Ditko, but also Sam Raimi has his trademark on this. Tobey Maguire is the greatest Spider-Man ever, and it was a pleasure to see him mentor the younger Peters.Is it even possible to not love this movie?"

If you're a fan of all the Spider-Man movies of the last 20 years then stop reading reviews and go see! Otherwise...While Endgame was also a fan-service movie, the premise was acceptable, stakes felt tense, the characters acted 'in-character' and the whole production was pulled off very smoothly.No Way Home is similar in fan-service only, everything else doesn't match Endgame's quality:Overall not a bad film, of course. It was well-made, fairly entertaining despite the flaws. Pacing ok. Good work from the cast. Zendaya decent value again, tho' her character is morphing into the 'crying damsel/emotional sponge' trope. Some fun FX, even if the Mirror Universe was more interesting in the first Strange movie (and Peter Parker's ""it's just geometry"" to get the better of the Master of the Mystic Arts was eye-rollingly poor).From the three Spider-Man films only Homecoming was a really good one. The other two are skippable. No Way Home has a whopping 8.2 rating on here, which I think makes it the highest-rated MCU movie outside of Infinity War/Endgame. So I expect especially Spider-Man fans to love it. But for casuals who are looking for the quality of the best Infinity Saga movies...well, this one may be a disappointment.Personally, I'm almost done with Marvel, just gonna do the second Doctor Strange movie, and finish with Guardians 3. Not gonna bother with any of the series or other movies. The reviews seem middling, and this Multiverse arc isn't that interesting, frankly."

If they hadn't appeared in this third Tom Holland Spidey film, the star rating would be MUCH LOWER lol. This is a decent enough final film in this Spider-Man trilogy (still no other Spider-Man films can touch Sam Raimi's epic trilogy), but the lackluster plot leans too strongly on nostalgia, coupled with spotty, cringy CGI, and plot holes resulting in a less-than-memorable Spider-Man film that's not that great and is plainly overhyped at the end of the day."

This movie is basically fanfiction but good.I grew up watching the Raimi Spider-Man movies so this was just one big nostalgia trip.The action was a lot of fun. It was very creative and intense.The performances ranged from good to amazing.Jon Watts directed the hell out of it. The movie has more personality when compared to most Marvel movies.Even though the reusing of lines from the Raimi movies was kind of cringey they still made me smile.The effects are fantastic.I actually liked Andrew Garfield's Spider-Man! He was very charismatic! I wish I felt something from the Gwen Stacy reference. It's too bad those movies were bad.It was great to see Tobey as Spider-Man and Peter Parker again! Every time he was on screen I was giddy. And he did a really good job! And as much as I love Tom Holland as both Peter Parker and Spider-Man Tobey will always be my Peter Parker and Spider-Man.I love how dark the tone is.I like how the other Peters don't overshadow Tom Holland.The rehabilitation scene was powerful.I love how they reused pieces of music from the Raimi trilogy.My favorite aspects of the film were the performances of Willem Dafoe and Alfred Molina, as well as this film's iteration of the Green Goblin and Doc Ock. Dafoe hijacks the movie and just from his acting alone you feel for Norman Osborn and are terrified of the Goblin. This iteration of the Goblin is the scariest villain in any Spider-Man movie and one of the scariest Marvel villains period. Molina's portrayal of Doc Ock is just as threatening as the one he gave back in 2004. After his first line I was like, ""He's still got it!"" And what ends up happening to him was very satisfying. In fact, each character gets a satisfying conclusion. Willem Dafoe will always be my Green Goblin. And Alfred Molina will always be my Doctor Octopus.Aside from the countless plot-holes, I think the movie suffers from some pacing issues."

Spider-Man: No Way Home is a fanservice galore fest done extremely well with jokes, emotion, and heart added to the mix. Not only giving closure to so much of Spider-Man's character, but also for the fans who always wondered how certain things would play out if they happened. This is a movie you need to witness.Picking up right off from Spider-Man: Far from Home, the film gets straight into action with dealing on consequences and trying to amend outcomes. In some ways similar to Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, the film stays interesting from scene after scene and never misses a beat. Solid action set pieces and character interactions give the film a lot of fun things to work with, and by the end everyone was clapping and cheering.Without spoilers, No Way Home will please most people who are familiar with all the previous Spider-Man films. I got a little emotional and attached when certain characters popped up again and I definitely didn't feel the movie was a quick-in cashgrab at all. The performances were all really good, the special effects were top notch, and some of the music will be familiar to the fans.In the end, it proves Marvel can still pull off a really entertaining yet rewarding movie for Spider-Man fans. Some minor criticisms I have is there are a few contrivances and maybe some characters could have gotten a bit more screentime, but in the end I had such a blast with what the movie set out to do. No Way Home will probably be my favourite film of 2021. Try to go without spoilers though, it will be more satisfying.8.5/10."

In order to eliminate the disturbance, Peter goes to Doctor Strange for help. However, an unexpected danger comes to Peter's next life.TRULY ONE OF THE SPIDER-MAN FRANCHISES THAT SPOILS ITS FANS!!!! Spider-Man: No Way Home is Tom Holland's third film series which has so far become one of the films that continues to be discussed by many people, whether from the presence of the old cast to scenes that might become memorable for us to watch the previous version of Spider-Man, Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield. Spider-Man: No Way Home tells the story of Peter Parker who asks Doctor Strange for help so that his life can return to normal. However, the spell becomes a disaster after Peter continues to harass Doctor Strange. Actually, for me the concept of the story is certainly a cringe because it is too easy to be brought into a foundation for conflict and Spider-Man's story this time. A college teenager who asked for a Sorcerer Supreme who should be wise in fact obeyed the wishes of the boy. Moreover, just a chatty interference from Parker actually resulted in the spell. Very irrelevant to me as a superhero movie. Coupled with the concept of Peter's character who is so innocent with his good intentions to help the villains of different universes get back on the path of kindness also for me kind of how to understand the story this time. I think that after Peter has been adventuring with the Avengers can cultivate Peter's maturity so far, this is not the case. Overall, this film is indeed a bit different from the previous Spider-Man films. This time for me, Spider-Man shows Peter Parker's childish side and immature maturity in carrying out the task of a masked hero. The result was the mess he had received during this time. Spider-Man: No Way Home is one of the favorite Spider-Man franchises because it has presented old characters, starting from the versions of Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield. Of course, this pleases Spider-Man fans in nostalgic watching the cast from the previous version, starting from Dr. Octo, Green Goblin, and even Electro. Of course, the presence and gathering of the three Spider-Men has become one of the memorable scenes to date."

He is the main draw and I hope they will give him few more movies of his own.So many refernces to previous spidey movies and cartoons, it's amazing. Andrew Garfield deserve one more movie of his own.

Jon Watts and the team behind this MCU Spider-Man trilogy have done such a good job delivering some of Spider-Man's best films... but this one truly takes the cake! It's my favourite Spidey film and quite possibly one of my favourite comic book movies in general! Everything it did worked so well for me and exceeded all of my expectations! I was completely blown away!

To even begin to talk about the movie in depth would take away from such a fun experience, so all I can say is just go watch it yourself! It truly shows why Spider-Man is such a beloved character, and delivers a film that honours everything that has come before while also being a very fitting conclusion to Tom Holland's ""Homecoming"" trilogy! It stuck the landing perfectly, and even I was doubtful that they could do it! It truly impressed me as a fan, and I just loved all the moments of fan-service and how those actually served the narrative in clever ways! I cheered, I laughed, I even cried! It's definitely the most emotional Spider-Man movie out there and the 3rd act is really something special. This one is gonna go down in pop-culture and cinematic history, it's awesome and does things that we've really never seen before! And it has to be said, Tom Holland is truly wonderful as Spider-Man, and shows here how gifted of an actor he really is! It's his best turn as the character to date! I also loved the return of classic villains, but I don't wanna get into specifics about it for spoiler reasons. I loved where the story went and it constantly kept me guessing and kept surprising me, I just was so blown away!! I'm deliriously happy by what this movie delivered, it hit all the right notes, and I cannot wait to see it again!

This movie is for low-attention-span adrenaline-immuned viewers, which unfortunately there are more and more of. Unless you are a group of teenagers looking for a night-out, I would not recommend this movie at all.I didn't expect much from this movie other to be an entertaining comic-book-like story. Boy, was I disappointed. It has been no more than a collection of random fight scenes with incoherent story and almost random dialogues in-between. Also, I think the casting of Spider-man, M. J. and Aunt May are just horrible. Tom Holland appears to have the brain of a 10-year old, and Zendaya is great in other films, but as MJ she just doesn't work, same goes for Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) she looks way too young, flirty and brainless, exact opposite of what this character should be.Overall it is a slaughterhouse to everything that spider-man should stand for. It is concentrated around universes and egocentric personal problems instead of being a moral model of real-world problems. The 2.5 hours long movie seem to just be an adrenaline shot one after the other, no substance and nothing to learn from. I'm sadden by having to write this, the production quality is great but where is a plot, a moral and generally being a better person. Sony should be ashamed of themselves for dragging Stan Lee's creation through the mud like that and Marvel should consider terminating their license for this creation. Seriously."

I was speechless after seeing it. There is not many words I can use to describe the experience of watching it other than breathtaking. The entire movie was a masterpiece, from the plot and story to the twist, cameos, and theatre atmosphere, this movie was unreal. It is also nearly completely filled with action and/or important scenes. There was one good minute to go to the washroom and it was in the first quarter of the movie. You don't want to miss anything after that. TRUST ME!To start, the plot and story of this movie was amazing. Absolutely phenomenal writing from Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers. They had so many different story lines to balance with all 5 villains from two different universes, and all the great characters from the MCU universe in this movie as well. They even had all the characters who crossed over from their universes leave at a certain moment from the original movies they were from and have the same personality as they did in that moment. They did perfectly. Classic callbacks from the Tobey and Andrew movies were added which was really cool to see. Some cool cameos were also added to the movie. There were also some amazingly shocking twist that just added a whole other feeling to the story. I won't talk a lot about it, but both the plot and the story were written perfectly. All credit to the two writers.I can't write a review on a Marvel movie without talking about the acting. As always, it was perfect. The main cast of Tom Holland, Zendaya, Jacob Batalon, and Benedict Cumberbatch who all reprised their roles for a minimum third time were of course, perfect, Jon Favreau and Marisa Tomei were also great as always, but it was the villains who stood out. They all reprised their roles in this movie, so we know they were good. But they were outstanding. Especially Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina, and Jamie Foxx. Willem and Alfred both had legendary performances in their first movies, and they did the same in this movie, but Jamie Foxx stood out for me. In my opinion, he was great in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014), but his performance in this movie was ten times better.Lastly, I have to talk about the atmosphere in the theatre. This movie and Avengers: Endgame (2019) are two of the best theatre experiences I have ever had. At certain scenes, it felt like a smaller sporting event. Not loud, but there were cheers and claps from the audience. It just made the overall experience so much better. I really hope to experience that once again one day.This movie definitely deserves 100% of the hype it got and the love it is getting. I don't know if I feel this way because I watched just over a week ago, or because it is actually that good, but I think this is the best superhero movie I have ever seen. It was unreal to watch, so I definitely recommend going to watch it. You won't regret it, trust me. Also, you MUST stay till the very end because there is both a mid, and post-credit scene, and both are very important. Like I said, I currently feel like this is the best superhero movie I have ever seen, it was just that good!"

With familiar faces of the MCU making somewhat a surprise appearance, contributing to the chart-topping Box Office success. Rave reviews of a well-humoured, thrilling script that justifies its praise and proves to be one of the greatest action spectacles of all time.With Spider-Man's identity now revealed, our friendly neighbourhood web-slinger is unmasked and no longer able to separate his normal life as Peter Parker from the high stakes of being a superhero. When Peter asks for help from Doctor Strange, the stakes become even more dangerous, forcing him to discover what it truly means to be Spider-Man.Tom Holland has came a long way from his Billy Elliott days and an awkwardly forced Geordie accent. The 25-year-old from Kingston upon Thames has pioneered his persona and made the role his own over the recent years. To visualise the three versions of Spider 'men' in the film only reminds us of Holland's class, the witty and at-times clumsy character takes away the seriousness of the superhero picture. The cinematography of the film is state of the art, from a snowy Doctor Strange's HQ to dusking green-land in a turmoil chain of events. Like most Marvel productions, the stunt team are under-appreciated for their roles in production - Tom Holland impressively performs his own, and trained tirelessly in preparation, however, the movie credits 75 names in its stunt section, emphasising the importance of their involvement in crafting such a high-profile, high-quality instalment.The watch itself is tantalising, a gripping plot which turns in mysterious ways and continues to give; a multiverse, modern day college decisions and the not-so-usual auntie and love interest relationship bode to create a masterpiece.Rising to its expectations. A scintillating display."

I really enjoy Tom Holland as Spider-Man, but am a much more casual MCU viewer. While I found this sequel to be a moderately entertaining 2.5 hours, I definitely did not find it to be anywhere near as enthralling a viewing experience as Marvel devotees did.The film picks up soon after ""Spider-Man: Far From Home"" ended, where Peter Parker's identity had just been exposed by the villainous Mysterio. Parker, infuriated that everyone knows who he is, goes to Doctor Strange to ask him to cast a spell so that everyone will not know that he is Spider-Man. But multiverse-related chaos ensues involving a multitude of villains, and Parker and his friends must work to set things right before it's too late. Tom Holland and Zendaya are superbly charismatic and fun as Spider-Man and MJ, respectively. The film has some amusing, CGI-filled action set pieces, although none of them are particularly unique or memorable compared to other MCU movies. As is typical of these films, the script provides enjoyable moments of comic relief combined with some clever callbacks to other MCU movies. Unfortunately, I didn't find the film to be as potent and impactful of a viewing experience as I hoped. It's certainly fun for die-hard Spider-Man fans, but a lot of it did not feel totally satisfying to me. The film's most problematic flaw is that feels like it has little narrative or structural reason to exist beyond simply fan service, unlike other major MCU crossover films like ""Avengers: Endgame"" or even ""Captain America: Civil War,"" where the plot progression and stakes felt much more consequential. In contrast, this film's attempts to establish grounded emotional stakes for neither its characters nor the future of the MCU feel as impactful or profound. Yet those simply there to see their favorite web-slinger will still enjoy the ride anyway, and on pure entertainment value, I still did to some degree. Recommended only to Marvel/Spider-Man fans. 6/10."

Tom Hollands spider-man in a film so crowded still manages to shine and outdoes himself with his performance. This feels like a true spider-man movie especially in the very last scene. His performance is incredible and some of the action sequences are beautiful with moves taken from the game. This feels like the most badass, realistic and cool portrayal of a spider-man yet. It maintains comic accuracy and tom's suits are beautiful. Some scenes are absolutely heart wrenching, i found myself crying numerous times. This film is a masterpiece and a love letter to all marvel or spiderman fans and a work of art. It avoids the other spider-man movies mistakes and just gives characters such realistic convincing arcs. A true work of art, round of applause for John Watts and Tom Holland."

I wasn't expecting the movie to take the turn that it did, but I'm glad that it did. Tom Holland really shines this time around. In the previous movies, he has been good yes, but here... This is a spoiler free review, but Tom gives a brilliant performance in a scene that was a real tear jerker. As for the rest of the cast - they were also fantastic. This movie more than the others, really gave our main characters a chance to shine. Zendaya is also great here, as well as Jacob Batalon and Marisa Tomei
are also really good. I was also surprised by the screentime of, Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina, Jamie Foxx and Benedict Cumberbatch. I was expecting them to be in the movie for a short time, but they have a good amount of screentime, and they are great in every scene.The music in this movie is also amazing. Marvel doesn't have a good track record of good music, aside from a few, and this one is added to that few. Michael Giacchino gives his best score since UP, and I loved how he added the villian themes from previous movies.This movie does have its faults, which I won't really put here, since they dive into spoiler territory, but some scenes feel a little too, fan fiction. Almost like the writer is speaking directly to the audience. But these faults don't really drag the movie down.No way Home was a blast of a movie, with amazing acting, visuals, music and is by far the best movie in Tom Holland's Spidy series. Who would have thought the third Spider-Man movie would be the best...9/10."

And although I enjoy nostalgia and it's superb that both Toby and Doc Oc appear here, there are somewhat too many villains in this film with a ridiculous idea to save them all . So while the cameos feel great, the peak of action in the film was not the battles with the villains , but the battle between Dr Strange and Spidey and after that everything else felt pretty bland . In fact due to multiple villains, there was almost no space left for a drama Spider man 2 style, so what we get is a numerous action sequences with a lot of mess happening in the background...

It is great too see again some old villains and in general there is a lot of fan service but is done well and it's not annoying. The movie is also able to trigger people reactions and if you watch this movie in a passionate theatre the experience will be great because you can hear the sounds of the people around you, and it was something that I didn't experience since the pandemic has started and it was nice. You'll probably walk out from the viewing with very positive vibes and with high levels of satisfaction. BUT if you start think about it with a more critical view the magic will vanish because nothing makes sense. The premise is so stupid and the movie happens because Peter had suddenly become retarded, and not only him. Things happen because we will never know (like the reason for the return of the villains, the movie tries to give an explanation but in reality doesn't). And realistically what is the probability that between an infinite number of universes could happen exactly what has happened in the movie? How fortunate we were! And also the finale (that is very very satisfying and emotional) comes from a sudden change of the rules established previously in the movie. And so you can see that everything is only a pretext to please fans but without a real structure or a good premise behind it. The plot is useful only for the fan service. And if on one hand it is what has made my watching an experience, it is something that has to be noted. And so I am divided between my fan nature that has liked this movie and my rational and objective nature that dislikes it because of the nonsense of the plot. And so in conclusion what I can say is: go watch it for the experience without expecting a good movie, only a collection of cool scenes."

There were some times, like the apartment scene, where it relied to much on nostalgia, but for the most part, it includes it very well into the story, to the point where it made sense, like with Tobey and Andrew's Spider-Man.While I am fan of Tom Holland's Spider-Man, this movie really enhances is story, especially near the end, where everyone forgets him, and Aunt May is dead, and he still willing to be Spider-Man.I will admit that some of the writing in this film isn't strong. It rushes through the story where Peter's identity revealed, and the reason why the multiverse broke is because Doctor Strange is to impulsive to talk to Peter about it was just lazy writing. It's also worth noting that the Visual Effects aren't really good, especially the Bridge scene.Overall, while this film does have problems, it's an absolute joy ride with well-executed nostalgia, and the story of Tom Holland's Spider-Man becoming something great."

It actually feels like the real origin of Tom's Spiderman showcasing the best qualities & worst tragedies of Spiderman. Finally I care about MCU Aunt May & MJ. The old villains return and a really empathetic story is built around them. Willem Dafoe steals the show again & establishes why Green Goblin is the arch-nemesis of Spiderman. There are some fan-service scenes which differ from the tone of the film and it has some pacing issues. Still, It belongs with the top films of MCU & is a Must-watch."

The plot is mostly similar to - Into the spiderverse esp the multiverse concept, although not at all copycat of it but a little of its own flavors of previous spiderman characters and villains. The spicy creativity of Dr Strange and spiritual scientific piece of thoughts makes it watchable despite its release succeeding Spider verse animated film. I still prefer the animated version as it would be the best in Spiderman franchise. A total masterpiece.I have not seen all spiderman franchise though but still understood well about the entire storyline. Very well built. SNWH is about spiderman adventure in multiverse existence and all the knitty-gritty edges with it. Excellent effects and character developement, which I always thought well of Hollywood productions from the days of 70s SiFi innovations. Though content wise it is similar to Spiderverse but still is different in the case of number of villains. Summing up both the movies are excellent though slightly different. But I liked spiserverse better than this. Still SMNWH is watchable and I liked it as Toby was a part of this film, involvement in it. He was excluded from Avengers but in this it's good that he was bought back.Throughout the movie I was impressed by one thing -
The mistakes, an immatured minds makes and then learning from the mistakes, gradually makes you matured wise and peaceful. A wondefully established reality in this comic story. A good comeback for Toby Maguire too in his famous role. A 95/100."

Not just because it is bad, but because of the misuse of all the resources that went into making it.I will be the first to admit that I have propensity to look for meaning when I am watching a film. Be it the straight-forward moral of the story or a higher meaning, something to make you think. That is how I enjoy cinema the most, when it gives me something to think about. Big or small. When the images on the screen are about something more than simply the images on the screen.This film is the complete opposite of it. Its meaning is inward-looking. It is not interested of looking at anything other than itself. It is complete and utter navel-gazing. That really is the crux of the film. That is the reason why this is barely watchable. Every flaw and mistake comes from this movie's own excessive self-contemplation.Where to put the blame is a different question. It has been established for some time that these MCU films are not ""directed"". There is no singular vision behind them and it boils down to an assembly line. The plot and dialogue are so bad I can't imagine anyone put any amount of thought into it. All the lines do actually feel like ad-libs the actors improvised on the day. Visually there is an absence of flair (and I am being generous) which is on par for the course for these movies by now. The soundtrack and sound design is, of course, forgettable. The editing is conventional. The set design is reminiscent of those real-estate videos where celebrities show their homes. The costume design is ok, again which is not shocking knowing the means that were allocated to this.The acting could have been the saving grace of the movie. Unfortunately, Tom Holland, Zendaya and Jacob Batalon are the stars of the film. And while their performances are good, they usually have to share the screen with (multiple) Oscar-winners. It is jarring to see the best talent doing what is basically glorified background work. That is why this is the worst movie of all time. You have a film packed with the best actors working today, but we have to follow Tom Holland's inane struggle on how to apply to some college.I am not even sure I want to go into the plot. In truth it does not matter. I suspect that even the makers of this took that as a given. The Marvel Cinematic Universe has now morphed into a never ending reference and call-backs machine. That is the core of this film: ""remember this?!"" The structure of it is one of a TV show, except in TV there is an A-plot and a B-plot. This film is all B-plot.As I am writing this, this film has been viewed by millions and is one of the highest grossing movies of all time. Please kill me now."

But believe me, it could've been a lot better with this cast, storyline and money. The problem here is directing.It's such a shame that even that final fight scene is so unremarkable. We don't have any iconic angle, view unlike in TASM or original trilogy. Soundtrack is so lame and lazy-made unlike FFH. Tom Holland's acting is so controversial, not his best that's for sure.And the other thing I don't like about this movie is everything is happening as if they're soo planned to happen. Like it doesn't feel alive at all, at least to me. I know that's a bit confusing comment but yeah that's how I am feeling.Still 7 stars tho. Because of the cast of course. Lucky them, they have this cast and they know they will have good ratings and appreciation no matter what their work's value is."

When the actors were filming this movie, they didn't know there were going to be three more movies after this and you can easily tell they wanted to bring their all to this movie. There is so much emotion in this movie that everybody conveys really well and everybody easily switched from serious to fun. This movie was easily Tom Holland's best performance as Peter and Spider-Man as you see his struggles and can easily relate to him. What definitely helped with everybody's performances was the writing for this movie. The writing easily made it seem like everybody in this wasn't always following a script and was just saying what seemed natural at the moment. I will say though for the writing the humour, for the most part, does work but there were still a few jokes that just didn't land or fit the tone properly. One thing that honestly surprised me about this was the pacing in this movie and how smooth it was. Going into this movie I thought this movie was going to feel slow in the beginning and then rushed but in reality, only two parts that felt rushed but both are justified because of the story. The last thing I'll mention briefly is the action in this movie. The action in this movie is easily some of the best for this series both Spider-Man-wise and MCU and I found myself smiling during every fight scene. In the end, Spider-Man: No Way Home completes this trilogy with a bang and cements this as a perfect MCU trilogy."

(Don't worry btw, if it isn't marked a spoiler review rest assured that there are no spoilers.)Anyway, with this film you may say that the hype is through the roof. It had one of the highest-grossing openings of all time, it got by the first week of its release to the top 10 of IMDb, and even some of the harshest critics seem to enjoy this film. When I've seen this film at opening night people went c r a z y at certain moments, it was like it's a game of soccer and not a movie XD Quite a funny experience, actually.Well, anyway, I did enjoy it, but I beg to differ from all the people who lavish praises on this film here.No Way Home is the direct continuation of Far From Home, depicting how Peter's life has changed after his secret identity was revealed by Mysterio. Desperate, Peter tries to solve this issue in a non-conventional way, and things go south. That's about as far as I can get into the plot without spoiling anything.There were quite a few things that I enjoyed it. Some of the villains (the two that were shown in the Trailer, if you know you know) were awesome. Their characters had some layers to them, the actors were spot on, and just the general way that they were written in this film is quite decent. Some of the funny moments felt natural enough to make this film more fun without making me roll my eyes and sigh. Also, this is probably the most interesting dive into Tom Holland's Spider-Man that we had so far. He went through a character arc that actually adds a lot to him as Spider-Man (though it did have some writing problems, to which I'll get in a moment). And I did like the ending too, even though it doesn't entirely work, logically. Again, fits Peter and adds some depth to his character. Also, J. K Simmons as Jay Jonah Jameson is so good here, I love every single second that he's on screen.One last thing - I like how this film is not afraid to go into (relatively) dark places, which was a problem in Infinity War imo but here it was done fairly well.Issues I had, folks! Quite a few here as well. Let's starts with the writin and the dialogue. As I said earlier, it wasn't all bad, but it did have some cringe moments XD Y'know how it is. A bad joke here, a line of dialogue that feels unnatural there. Not a terrible issue on that aspect, but when you look at certain characters...well. I'd say that this film has a noteable issue here - it has a lot of characters in it, and quite a few of them (also some of the important ones, like Aunt May which was extremely boring here. She was used as a plot device, no more) are just so flat and uninteresting. I get why those characters are there, and I can't say that there was a lot to do with them, but it doesn't make it a whole lot better.Honestly though, the biggest issue of this film (which is related to some of the previous ones I mentioned) is how gimmicky it is, how it puts so much effort into fan service and as a result makes the plot really flimsy and forced at points. I can't say that I don't enjoy the fan service, cause I kinda do and it does work out in a really decent way at certain points, but it doesn't make up for that problem. Some of the characters being written in a boring way just emphasizes how some of them are only here to do a massive fan-service. And you know, it kinda works, but I can't say that it didn't make this film feel just like a big, corporate, capitalistic move that doesn't try that hard to be good as a film. At times.Yet, after all of this ranting and critcism, I'd be lying if I said that I didn't enjoy this film or like it overall. I had a fun, memorable watching experience both on first and second watch - some of that is because of the people I went with to see the film, but some it's definitely due to the film being enjoyable and unique in what it does. A gimmick, ,but not a horrible one. If you're a fan of Spider-Man and Spider-Man films you're probably gonna like it, at the very least, and it already made a lot of impact and buzz so you may as well watch it just to understand what everyone's talking about (though I wouldn't recommend watching it without watching the other Spider-Man films, no only from this trilogy but in general).Anyway, that was a long review. This film is flawed, but very enjoyable, and it has some undeniable qualities. I'm feeling a 6.8/10 on this one."

An unbelievable blast for Spider-Man fans. I didn't think Marvel would come up with anything this spectacular after Endgame. The new Spider-Man may not surpass the Avengers in my opinion, but he's damn close on their heels. This was unreal. All three Spider-Men together. Seeing Tobey Maguire as Spider-Man on screen was a dream of mine and this movie made it come true. When he showed up, I thought I was gonna cry. Aside from him, I was very happy to see old familiar bad guys like Goblin and Octopus, who were absolutely excellent. I keep raving about how much I enjoyed the return of familiar faces from the Spider-Man trilogy, but I also have to praise the line of the current one or Tom Holland, which was also wonderful and had some really great moments. What I was very pleasantly surprised by, and actually can't believe, is how much they managed to cram it all into two and a half hours. It's already a longer film, but with a giant cast of characters. It's all very fast-paced here, so I wasn't bored at all and kept getting adrenaline shots. Wordless action. Totally unreal. Famous. I enjoyed it so much. As I mentioned the film is fast paced but despite that there is nothing rushed and I felt like every character had their own space. I don't understand how Marvel does it, but in short, they've proven that they can take bigger bites and do a great job of it, and I'm smiling. This movie had huge potential, no doubt. I was worried it wouldn't live up to it. I'm having a hard time judging it here. I'm slightly disappointed by some things and slightly pleased by others. Some things have been pleasantly surprising, others have been disappointing. In short, I could even imagine some moments that would have been perfect with all three Spider-Men, but unfortunately it didn't happen. On the contrary, there were other moments that I didn't expect and I was very pleasantly surprised and they were really cool. But I think it turned out great and with a few exceptions I'm absolutely satisfied. It's already a longer film and if all the potential was to be used, I really don't know how many hours the film would end up being. But a lot was accomplished in 2 and a half hours, for which I take my hat off. To sum it up. Spider-Man: No Way Home is, in my opinion, one of the best Marvel movies ever made, and for me, a great movie that I recommend."

I had to take some time for this experience to sink in and assimilate what it alone has accomplished in a 2h runtime. Well done, Marvel, well done.For those who criticised this movie of having a ""pandering"" fan service or messy plot didn't quite understand the main purpose and theme of the movie. I am not excusing its possible filmmaking-related flaws, but it never set out to be flawless in the first place and I love that about it.This movie wasn't only about pleasing fans but it was also about providing Tom Holland's Spider-Man of the wake up call it so desperately needed. Everyone who criticised the MCU portrayal of Spider-Man has been proven wrong as the character has evolved and matured over the course of the movies to reach the portrayal we all know and love. Far From Home was a step in the right direction from Homecoming, but this one is the pinnacle of it all. I have to give it to screen writters and everyone creatively involved in the movie from a story perspective because they have outdone themselves. This movie, while not exempt of filmmaking flaws and contrivances, has delivered what we never thought we needed. Maybe it's me, maybe I'm blinded by the fact that any and all plot devices used in this movie are of my liking. In a world of magic and sci-fi, political disputes and spionage are rendered a bit underwhelming to me.About the fan service, this is fan service done right, because it services the story. The multiversal backdrop serves primarily for two things: redemption and realisation. I don't want to get into too much spoilers, but certain characters and emotional moments return to redeem characters who need redemption and for others to realise that actions have consequences. Something that we finally see in an MCU Spider-Man movie, something that ever since its comicbook conception in the 1970s has defined and established the character as one of the best in the industry.Like Dave Filoni said about Star Wars: ""It's not really about what we decorate it with (x-wings, lightsabers, aliens) but the familial conflicts, the emotional turmoil that defines Star Wars and sets it apart from the rest"". Spider-man is not what we decorate it with, is not only about the swinging, the villains, the crazy adventures, it's about the human element, it's about how these affect the Man in Spider-Man. I have always been more fascinated with the portions of the comic where we see internal struggle within Peter, when we see him fail, loose, suffer; because it makes the eventual triumph that much more spectacular.This movie single-handedly fixes whatever I saw was wrong with Tom Holland's Spiderman portrayal and elevated him to the stratosphere, leaving him off with a great prospect on what is to come. Not only that, but every character introduced is given enough moments to shine and takeaway something from this major event. Every single character that I wasn't quite sold on (from the principal ones I mean) have found a place to shine and show performances that enhances the movie, particularly Zendaya, Willem Dafoe and Alfred Molina.It's one of the most daring MCU plots yet and it also manages to please all the cinematic Spider-Man fans at the same time. Whatever movie flaw it might have I have overlooked them as I do the rest of the MCU movies. These are not meant to revolutionise cinema, they are here to entertain, to provide interesting characters and stories and, sometimes even, to elevate and uplift us.IN CONCLUSION, I have no issues with this movie overall. I have some small nitpicks here and there, mostly to do with some of the comedy and side characters. But other than that, it sets out to do what it intended and, believe or not, serves as both conclusion to the MCU Spider-man and also transitioning movie to the stories to come. And I for one can not wait to see what's in store. If you are a Spider-Man fan you will love this movie because it does everything right, if you are a casual MCU fan you will be entertained and amused; and if you are a casual movie fan this movie might be a bit confusing. But then again, these are comicbook stories, I don't know what to tell you."

The idea that this would be a multiverse movie with Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man and Andrew Garfield's Spider-Man and their villains returning was backed by leaks and reinforced by a whole host of memes going back to the Spring. In a strange way, the leaks helped the movie. While Tobey and Andrew appearing out of the blue would've been one of the most stunning surprises in movie history, the villains appearing would've spoiled it and it would've been hard to market the movie without multiverse characters. Until they appear, there's a certain amount of tension in every scene, wondering if the reunion with Tobey and Andrew is right around the corner.A movie as fanservice filled as this is a tall order to make right, but it succeeded. For that to happen, Tobey, Andrew, and their villains need to meaningfully contribute to the movie, both in regard to giving them a satisfactory update and/or conclusion and also work for Tom's arc. They succeed. Andrew got some degree of closure, and even mocked his status as the least popular. That scene with him and MJ was perfect. Tobey didn't get as much, but it was definitely a pleasure to see him. Most importantly, the two of them are sort of mentor figures for Tom, voices of reason when he begins to stray. Some of the best parts of the movie are the little scenes of dialogue between the three of them. For the villains, it kind of works, mostly on a case-by-case basis. Doc Ock was probably the best one. Sandman and Lizard were mostly there to be there.There is, in fact, a whole movie here that isn't about the multiverse characters. It does begin with Tom reeling from the effects of Far From Home's ending. Wanting to make people forget he's Spider-Man, he gets Doctor Strange to cast an extremely powerful spell that opens up the multiverse. In the previous MCU movies, Tom was the kid of the bunch. With this movie and how it ends, he really grows up significantly from where he was in Civil War and Homecoming. It finishes the high school aspect of this, as that's been a part of who he is up to this point. The acting in this movie is surprisingly good, especially from Tom. Of the villains, Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina, and Jamie Foxx were the best.There are, of course, some things it does wrong. Daredevil was hyped up by leakers, but he only has one scene. What's the point of bringing him in if he's barely going to do anything for a plotline that goes nowhere? The attempted redemption arc for the villains, with the exceptions of Doc Ock and Electro, felt cheap. While Dafoe was awesome, the Green Goblin character arc is either a cheap cop-out or completely self-contradictory with Aunt May's ideas. The tie-in with Venom was disappointing and didn't seem to make much sense in No Way Home's overall story. While the whole thing with the Spider-Men discussing what is means for them to be Spider-Man is a great scene, Spider-Verse did it better.While it doesn't affect the movie's score, it is worth noting the movie's financial success despite coming out at the time it did was remarkable. Usually, I hate it when people clap or cheer in movie theaters, but in this case it's been so long that I welcomed it. And as someone who was a little kid with Spider-Man with Tobey Maguire as his first PG-13 rated movie, I myself gave a big round of applause when he came on screen. There's something bittersweet about it. I remember being so disappointed when Spider-Man 4 got cancelled back in the day, and this was the closest I'll ever get to that."

Well it partially is. But Peter Parker is only a kid. Aunt May was an adult. And it was her idea to save the evil villains and give them a second chance in the first place. So it was Aunt May's fault also. These are criminals who murdered people for personal gain and evil objectives. And Aunt May wanted to give them a second chance. Well, they got a second chance. And no surprise, they killed again. ""Too bad Aunt May.

And it makes no sense in a movie.Criminals need to be held accountable for their crimes. And innocent people need to be protected from them by putting them behind bars.Huge Plot Hole --- There is a enormous battle in the end of the movie around the Statue of Liberty that brings down all the scaffolding, and where Dr. Who cracks up the sky.

This isn't The Godfather!If you've enjoyed Holland's other outings, you will enjoy this.The trailer gives you clues as to what to expect AND I would strongly suggest you watch all previous Spider-Man films (the Sam Raimi versions and the ""amazing Spider-Man"" versions).It'll help.First of, the film is certainly fun and funny. Lot's of jokes and in jokes.There is some lag though. There is whole 10 minute scene in Happy's apartment that plods a little but then we're back to it.I think of all the previous Spider-Man relationships, Hollands and Zendya's is the most believable (well that may well be as they are a couple in real life).The film is sort of like a sweet nostalgia trip.There are a few questions, we as the audience needed answering and which are even asked in the film, but the answers are never given. Despite that, it does a very good job of resolving a lot and putting to bed a number of issues from past films.I have said nothing of the plot nor do I intend to.The reason you are reading this review is either you want to understand why I didn't give it a 10/10 and therefore why am I not fanboying over it or you genuinely want to know whether it's worth seeing in the cinema.The answer to the first question is that it's a very good film but it won't make my top 10 of all time. There is a lot thrown at this and a lot of it sticks but some of it doesn't quite hit the mark.The answer to the second question is well it depends on the cinema.My advise is that you go see it a big screen, good seating, social distanced cinema. You want that cinematic experience.I went to an multiplex with people sitting next to each other in a reasonably packed theatre with a screen which, frankly by today's standard, was bog standard to small (which surprised me considering the calibre of film being shown),So yeah, go see it (especially if you've seen all the previous ones) but on a grand big old screen cinema with comfortable seating.Enjoy."

My interest in the Marvel phenomena has definitely dwindled post-Endgame and while I have enjoyed some of the Disney+ shows, the hype for this needed to deliver.The entertainment levels are consistent throughout and it makes the experience even more engaging as the film goes on. The action sequences, the chemistry, the humour all add to the experience.The fan service is what this film is about, but it's narrative (involving the multiverse) makes complete sense for the trajectory of the franchise , it wasn't just thrown in for nostalgic purposes. And there was an interesting climax that adds further questions to an already complex narrative. Watch this space.Marvel delivered on a lot of levels here, it was just a great watch from start to finish. No doubt my favourite Spider-Man there's been for a long while, and just Marvel film since Endgame.Highly recommended. Enjoy."

It won't be sweeping the Oscars but it will be beloved by the public for generations to come. It was definitely worth the wait. As I've mentioned in previous reviews, I'm one of the people with Marvel fatigue. I'm fed up with Marvel's pop culture takeover and their churning out films every single year. But even I enjoyed this film.They really use the element of nostalgia to keep the audience's attention, but it's done so in a fun and entertaining way. I was of the generation that grew up with Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man so my inner child was really happy to see him, Alfred Molina, and Willem Defoe back on the screen. Andrew Garfield had his redeeming moment in this film, after being labeled the ""worst Spider-Man"" by many movie goers and fans. The movie even pokes fun at this in one of the scenes and has the first cinematic Peter Parker, Tobey Maguire, tell him that he was indeed ""amazing."" I really enjoyed that scene. The action scenes are great, the final battle at the end is epic and the emotional scenes tug at your heartstrings.It had a couple of similar moments to The Spiderverse animated film that was released a couple years ago. I don't think they could really do it any other way though. One scene that was straight from the Spiderverse film was when the other two Spider-Man's are telling Tom Holland Spider-Man how they also lost someone special in their timelines. It's not identical but it is similar. Into The Spiderverse is my #1 favorite Spider-Man film but this one is now my second. Plus they hinted at the future inclusion of Miles Morales when electro said some dialogue that asked if there's a Black Spider-Man somewhere out there.I highly recommend going to see this film while it's still in theaters. It's a really fun experience. Great job to everyone involved in this project. I can tell they had fun making it and the result is fantastic."

It built upon the wider context of the many Spider-Man film series and turned it into an unique experience. Additionally, the wide variety of cast members played well off each other. I cannot remember a single bad performance.Although, I do think parts of the film went by a little too quick.

Their presence not only evokes a sense of nostalgia but also allows for compelling character interactions and exploration of the different interpretations of Spider-Man.The action sequences are exhilarating and well-choreographed, providing a visual feast for viewers while seamlessly blending humor and heart.

The release of what is now become a Marvel movie that is at par with Avengers: Endgame given the scale, the characters and emotions. No Way Home is the third movie in the MCU Spider-Man trilogy and it is the best one yet (across all spidey movies ever).No Way Home picks up where we left off in Far From Home with Mysterio revealing the man behind the mask. Parker & his friends are forced to clear their name but there are repercussions. Wishing to lead a normal life, he approaches Dr. Strange for help that results in fracturing the multiverse & sending people who know Peter Parker is Spider-Man through.No Way Home is everything you wished for from a superhero movie. It provides a fast paced, well thought out plot with non-stop action sequences. And for a film filled with countless characters, everyone gets a chance to shine (that is something even Endgame couldn't do). Marvel Studios & Sony Pictures have done a great job at tricking everyone with their trailers because there are a lot of differences & additions to what we saw.The cast is top notch as always. The villains are many but they are all familiar faces & it was nice to see all of them again. Dafoe's Green Goblin proves yet again why he is Spidey's biggest (& best) villain. And it is good to see Electro lose his creepy blue look.Spider-Man: No Way Home lives upto the expectations & the hype. It does a lot of fan service but does not compromise on the plot in any way. It is one of the best Spider-Man... Marvel... Superhero movie of all time!"

5,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9462196/?ref_=tturv_perm_503,Wildly overrated gimmicky sequel,,7,7,TheRetroCritic,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur4027771/?ref_=tturv_usr_503_t,28-Nov-23,"Inarguably the most successful film of 2021, Spider-Man: No Way Home picks up exactly when the last film left off as Spider-Man's secret identity is finally revealed to the world. Peter Parker (Tom Holland) and his friends face backlash following J. Jonah Jameson's bombshell and so Parker seeks the help of Doctor Strange to make all of this mess go away.The concept was teased in prior sequel Far From Home but the Multiverse is finally confirmed to be real in this movie as Stephen Strange's (Benedict Cumberbatch) attempt to use a spell that would potentially fix Peter Parker's problem opens up a whole new can of worms including heroes and villains from other Multiverses turning up in our friendly neighborhood Spider-Man's... well, friendly neighborhood. This was set to be one of the biggest comic-book movie crossovers ever in the style of hit animated feature Into The Spider-Verse but, of course, live-action. Online speculation was non-stop during the entire journey leading up to this film's release with fans wondering which previous cast members of the franchise would turn up.The multi-cameo gimmick would no doubt be this film's biggest draw, but also its biggest challenge as a coherent plot would need to tie everything together well enough. Luckily, Marvel had thusfar handled this kind of juggling act rather well. Judging by the audience reaction to this movie, it appears that the gimmick in question was very much a crowdpleaser and understandably so: seeing some of your favorite characters from your favorite franchise return in a new movie played by a beloved cast is always a nice nostalgic treat. Especially if they're having as much fun as the likes of Jamie Foxx, Willem Dafoe and Alfred Molina are having in this latest film.The film's opening is a promisingly intense look at the overwhelming media attention that Peter Parker and his Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) are forced to deal with, along with the negative impact this has had on his friends' lives, which he blames himself for. Doctor Strange agrees to help by casting a spell that would make it so everyone would forget that Peter Parker is Spider-Man. Unfortunately, Peter's demands for countless caveats compromises the spell which Strange is forced to contain.But the damage is already done as the spell has already started to mess with reality and opened up the door for some unsavory characters like Doc Ock (Alfred Molina), the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe), Electro (Jamie Foxx), The Sandman (Thomas Haden Church) and The Lizard (Rhys Ifans). Spider-Man takes on these villains who are unknown to him but clashes with Doctor Strange when the latter suggests destroying the spell, thereby sending them all home, whether this means they'll be dead again or not.This is a fun, playful, setup and it certainly gives this movie a lot to work with, especially when other Spider-Men start appearing. Unfortunately, there's not much more to this film than fanservice and thinking about its story for more than a few seconds prompts a bunch of question marks. Some of the villains, we are told, have been transferred here just before they died, despite them looking either way older or completely different. Some of the character designs are improved while some are exactly the same or way worse. Apparently summoning ""Peter Parker"" through a spell only summons Peter Parkers who are also Spider-Man.Peter Parker is praised repeatedly for the choices he makes in the film despite everything obviously being a complete disaster. Villains can just be turned good and bad, on and off, like a light switch. J. Jonah Jameson is given a big reveal in the last movie but he's barely in this one (why not bring back the old J. J. J. And have him face his own grumpy self for some easy, worthy comic relief?). It's all very inconsistent and, frankly, rarely convincing.Still, there's enough here to make No Way Home an entertaining popcorn movie: the Doctor Strange vs Spider-Man fight sequence in the Mirror Universe is fantastic, the face off with Doc Ock is enjoyable, Jamie Foxx is a much better Electro this time around, Andrew Garfield nearly steals the show with a particularly endearing performance and it's just nice to see all these likable actors have a good time on screen.Once the reintroduction of Spidey's baddies is digested, however, the film fails to make the best use of its cast and plot as the macguffin (magic box) coupled with yet another final rooftop fight in the dark (see the ending of Spider-Man 3 meets the ending of The Amazing Spider-Man) lacks originality and rhythm. The overly jokey script is also a massive, unwelcome distraction as it makes many characters feel off and the constant flow of lame one-liners comes off as extremely forced.In the vein of the X-Men franchise's Days Of Future Past, this Spider-Man movie aims to mix different versions of the same series together in order to fix a few flaws that fans have been complaining about for a while, but also cash in on nostalgia and take the franchise in a new, unexpected direction. As a result of this very ambitious endeavor, parts of this work but a lot of it doesn't and, as much as it was nice to see some familiar faces here, less would 100% have been more.The script feels bloated and yet, at the same time, bare: Zendaya isn't given much to work with here character development-wise, while Ned (Jacob Batalon) overstays his welcome with a big role when this movie called for a cameo from him at the most. This translates into a strangely paced movie with its share of dull filler. The attempt to redo the Uncle Ben scene AGAIN, just slightly differently, is a complete misstep as the scene in question feels about as emotionally rewarding as the awful Sandman CG seen throughout this film.This movie throws a lot at you and, yes, some of it sticks. No doubt about it. But there's just too much fluff, too many heavy-handed references, too many inconsistencies and too much Whedonian corniness to make this a truly rewarding experience. You'll have fun with some of the action scenes, you'll enjoy seeing your fave villains/heroes on screen again but that's pretty much it. No Way Home has its moments but it remains a passably entertaining outing and the lesser film in the Tom Holland trilogy.Amusing yet uneven blockbuster."

This is so far my favorite MCU movie taking over the throne from Thor: Ragnarok. I loved almost everything about this movie.

I won't spoil anything, but I'm just going to say, it doesn't matter if your a fan of the Maguire Era, or the Garfield Era, you are going to have a good time. I'm more of a Maguire Era person who grew up loving those movies, yes even three, and I adored this and may even surpass the Maguire movies for me. Jon Watts does a fantastic job meshing all of the elements together, keeping it focused, creating good pace, not causing a convoluted mess like so many films that try to have so many elements meshed. I liked also that they kept the MCU humor to a minimum, which I don't mind the humor, it's just got to be used in the correct movie. This isn't the correct movie to have humor, and did a good job of keeping it minimal. Overall, I had a blast with this movie and deserves every eye that watches it. A true masterclass of a job by everyone involved. 10/10."

And amidst the pandemic, people are flocking theatres and although spoilers are everywhere, the movie is buzzing for right reasons. Sony has finally taken the MARVEL route, combined it perfectly with the nostalgia and delivered probably the greatest movie in Spiderman history.Whatever I could reveal about the plot is pretty much already in the trailer and anything else would be a spoiler. The movie is equally serious and goofy and manages to maintain the Spiderman charm throughout. The action sequences are brilliant, humour is thoroughly enjoyable and the visual effects take you for a ride (especially the ones that involve Dr Strange).It is a very hard task to balance so many characters of high importance in one movie. But Jon Watts successfully manages so many key characters and actors. The humour element added to the old Spiderman villains helps as well. I don't wanna go about how each individual has performed as I could go on and on.Spiderman No Way Home strikes perfect balance with the new age MARVEL universe fans and the old Spiderman franchise fans and leaves everyone quite 'spell'bound."

One of the best MCU films and one of the best Spider-Man films competing with the likes of Spider-Man 2 and Into the Spiderverse.This film is the X-Men: Days of the Future Past and the Endgame to the Spider-Man series. It's Exactly how you bring a trilogy or series home.This movie pretty much has it all. Action, emotion, darkness,comedy, nostalgia and all the usual thing you would expect from a Spider-Man movie.The performances from the villains are strong... Marvel's Spider-Man really breaks out in this film even though i haven't enjoyed Tom Holland as much as the previous Spider-Men. The supporting cast are strong too.Skip the trailers, watch recaps of the previous films and then sit back and enjoyIt's not perfect. There were some decisions made by Spider-Man and Dr Strange that threw me during the first half but once I got past that it was a great ride.I won't be forgetting the audience reactions to certain big moments in this film.MCU Phase 4 needed this. Whilst this film felt much more like a contained Spider-Man film than the others, it will serve to push forward THE MCU phase 4 and drum up interest where some of the others have failed too."

Therefore, Peter Parker now has to fight his identity and live two lives, one as Parker and the other as Spider-Man. Peter asks Doctor Strange for help in which the spell goes wrong because of Parker and he has to face the consequences of his own mistake.Spider-Man No Way Home is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. The film presents several different emotions and experiences that are worthy for a Spider-Man audience. This film is made specifically for Spider-Man fans.Jon Watts uses several different techniques that some are taken from Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy. For instance, the action sequences and how the camera moves in them, or the Spider-Man swings and his movements and poses during such sequences. The cinematography in this film is great. The use of close-up shots and extreme close-up shots to capture the emotions on characters' faces as well as the use of wide shots or medium shots to capture the set design and action or event that is happening in a specific scene.Tom Holland gives his best performance as Spider-Man. Audience members are finally able to see Peter Parker's struggle to live two different lives and his struggle to maintain a sustainable life as a teenager to accommodate his dreams and ambitions. Tom Holland plays a big role in delivering these feelings to the audience as he got the chance in this film to really show himself in which the development of his acting is clear. As it is confirmed in the trailer, there are 5 villains from past Spider-Man films who appear in this film, 2 of them are unfortunately there as fan service (only to please them). Without them, the film would have been the same. On the other hand, Green Goblin (played by Willem Defoe) and Doc Ock (played by Alfred Molina) are the opposite. They have enough screen time and their appearance in the film is as important ad the main characters. After 18 years, William Defoe is able to play both Norman Osborn and Green Goblin as perfectly as he did 18 years ago in Raimi's Spider-Man version. In a specific scene, he literally turns from Norman Osborn to the villein Green Goblin in which is seen by his amazingly done acting and facial expressions. A quick transformation like that in one scene done by one actor playing two different characters commit be done by many actors. The same exact thing goes for Alfred Morino as Doc Ock as his performance is great as well and similar to Defoe's.During the events of the film, the characters go through lots of tough decisions in which they decide to choose some of the dumbest that it'll make audience members wonder why. In addition, a few events happen without explaining them well or not going in-depth in them or not explaining at all, which creates a hole in the film itself. However, and even though all of these negativities exist, the film's positive side hides these negativities and makes them invisible because of how FULL this film is. The ending is absolutely great and the perfect one that's needed.The film's first act is good. It sets audience members to what is about to happen and gets them ready for the events of the film. Then it moves to the second act which is somewhat messy at times and lacks in few scenes due to its boring sequences that may seem long. However, that does not mean that it isn't entertaining. It still has a few events that play a big role in terms of the story. The third act saves the whole film. It is well written and very well made in terms of the story, action, visual effects, or even the dialogues. Same as Homecoming (2017) and Far From Home (2019), No Way Home has several funny sequences that are actually funny and not cringy or cheesy. It may even be the best Spider-Man or superhero film that maintains a perfect balance between comedy, drama, and action.Spider-Man No Way Home is the film that every Spider-Man fan ever wanted. It has comedy, excitement, disappointments, drama, and everything you ever want. The film balances perfectly between everything to present an entertaining film from start till end. Experiencing it in IMAX with a full-house theatre was a once-in-a-lifetime experience.My rating is 8.5/10
Watched in IMAX."

From here things get way out of control. There are lots of familiar characters dropping in and adding to the story and action.The movie drags on a bit for the first part. But is needed to link the story together. The story is clever, well thought out and has some interesting twist's to it. There is lots of action mixed with a healthy dose of political correctness. Visually it's great and well made, what you expect from a Marvel movie. There are some deep and heart tugging emotional scenes, along with the all web slinging.Maybe just a bit long at 2 hours and 28 minutes? But the second half of the movie, makes up for the slow start. A good movie and in the top echelon of superhero movies."

There are obviously little easter eggs and jokes for the fans of the franchise, but it's still a stand alone movie.I do like some Marvel films like Guardians of the Galaxy and Dead Pool, but those are very different. They are not heroes but rather anti-heroes, who are riddled with flaws and human traits.In the Spider universe, the super heroes are above human emotions for the most part, everything they do is alway the right moral decision even if it gets them in trouble. And the villains lack any dimensions, but have fun superpowers, and only play the role of being an obstacle for the super heroes.Basically, these movies are made to teach children about always doing the right thing, usually based on some modern humanism and neo-moderate Catholic/christian morality.Because this is a movie mostly for children, it's devoid of any challenging moral issues, matters of philosophy and understanding of the cosmos. Nothing really makes any logical sense, but it's okey because, the forced story telling, and illogical situations, are there as a story telling tool, to develop characters and create one emotionally charged scene after another.This franchise is all about making profit, so this movie has mass appeal and jokes and action which most audience can enjoy. So, nothing new, just a big Hollywood cash machine.It is entertaining, loaded with all the usual eye candy, jokes, massive scenes of carnage and destruction, but no one actually gets hurt, other than egos of villains. So yeah, it children safe.I recommend this movie because, sometimes you just want to watch an easy to follow movie where you don't have to use you brain much. And just watch a spectacle to relax, or like me in this situation packing for a cross country motorcycle trip and didn't want to focus on the movie.So, chill grab a beer and enjoy what Hollywood is known for."

If you are a fan of Toby or Andrews Spider-Man movies then you will love this one.

Zendaya continues to get more scenes and you absolutely love the relationship she has with Peter in the movie. Jacob Batalon is still really funny in these movies. J. K

Unfortunately for him; his best intentions are about to make things much worse in ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"".Taking place where ""Spider-Man: Far From Home"" ended; Peter must deal with his secret identity being leaked by Tabloid Journalist J. Jonah Jameson (J. K. Simmons); and the throngs of people, helicopters, and protestors who follow his every move and camp outside his home.As if this was not bad enough; being accused of being a murderer has drawn the attention of the authorities which further complicates his life as does returning to a school where everyone knows his identity.Desperate to get away from the constant scrutiny and observation; Peter seeks out Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), and asks him to cast a spell that would make the world forget that Peter Parker is Spider-Man.Strange agrees but mid-spell Peter requests that there are some exemptions from the spell which include his Girlfriend MJ (Zendaya); his Aunt May (Marisa Tomei); and his friend Ned (Jacob Batalon).Strange agrees but in doing so; complications arise which allows entrants from other dimensions to enter their realm. Soon Peter is accosted by villains whom he does not know but seem to know him; that is until he is unmasked and they have no idea who this Peter Parker is before them.As more villains arrive; Peter learns of their fates in their natural dimension and is determined to save them and give them a second chance which puts him at odds with Doctor Strange who says they must go back to whatever fate they had.What follows is a descent into humor and darkness as Peter despite his best intentions sees the situation go from bad to worse and he must fight to stay true to himself and save the day.The film is a difficult one to review in the fact that there are so many surprise guests, twists, and turns that it is challenging to not reveal anything but suffice it to say that fans should absolutely enjoy it.The film takes its time getting to the action as it has a very slow and deliberate climb and Director Jon Watts is confident enough in the characters and premise that he allows ample time for the characters and setting to build and be established before he gets to the action.While there is considerable fan service in the film; it never once seems like it is pandering and it all fits very well within the story and the MCU and opens up numerous possibilities for the future.There is a mid-credit scene and a post-credit scene which is basically a trailer and both are very engaging in terms of the possibilities as Marvel has again shown that their plan of interwoven stories and characters continues to deliver and that Spider-Man still remains as popular and engaging as ever."

I will make it simple, the movie will live to your expectations If not exceed them, however, during the first half of the film you won't witness anything new. Every fight scene is in the trailer and I LITREALLY mean every fight scene. But don't get me wrong they were awesome and of course not the whole fight scenes. It's also full of talking and a bit more funny lines than usual. You also have a very very silly plot that was based on some character's opinion and lead to all the events of the film and then comes on of the best plots and entrances near the beginning of the second half that you will ever witness and here comes the second half of the movie and trust me it was beyond awesome. The VFX of this film is breathtaking. Every action sequence is very complicated and loaded with tons of details. The visuals are insaaane. You also have a couple of Spidy suits and most importantly you won't be disappointed with anything you might be expecting. You have Dr. Strange and believe me it was one of the best times you will see him along with another hero cause Benedict is such a great actor. Zendaya role however was meaningless but you know she is Spidy's GF. The Finale of the film is beyond great and feels like a dream come true for all fans around the world that will leave you full of emotions, amazed and shocked! Even the two post credit scenes made everyone yell in the theatre (who yelled for more than half of the movie). Not a perfect movie and a lot of things may not make sense and will make your brain full of questions like Endgame and that's what make a movie a great one. I have now experienced the whole trilogy at the theatre and there is no doubt that this one is the best. I hope you just relax and enjoy it cause as a fan I'd give it a 10/10 easily but a solid 9/10 with love and joy is fair enough."
