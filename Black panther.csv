Wakanda is struggling after the unexpected death of King T'Challa. Ramonda (Angela Bassett) takes over as Queen. It's a year later. The outside world is demanding that Wakanda shares its technology and vibranium. Unbeknownst to them, the CIA led by Valentina Allegra de Fontaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) has found vibranium buried under the sea. The CIA crew is massacred by Namor (Tenoch Huerta) and his people although Wakanda is blamed. Namor is demanding the death of the inventor of the vibranium detector and that Wakanda join him in a war against the surface.The real world death of Chadwick Boseman has thrown this part of the MCU into turmoil. This movie relies heavily on the acting power of veteran Angela Bassett and she gets an Oscar nomination. Arguably, she leads the movie for the first half despite not being on the action mission. The other big aspects of this movie are the passing of the torch and the introduction of Namor. I am not that enamored with the torch passing. It needs to be done, but it could be better. Quite frankly, I'm not sold on the who. Like so many things, time will tell. Finally, Namor gets introduced into the MCU. He is probably one of the bigger Marvel character to not get something so far. I like his story and his history. Again, time will tell, but this has good potential. After Boseman's death, this will always going to be a memorial service and a patchwork story. Both are done well enough and Angela Bassett really shoulders the load."

The Black Panther film was decent, but except for it being a breakthrough film with a unique cast, was just okay, in my opinion. This one is so inundated with complex elements it's hard to follow who's who and what's what. The science is confusing enough. Like many movies with superheroes, the world in which the characters move has to be grounded in something. This one is grounded in confusion. I'm sure the box office will put out yet another film with this milieu, but the Marvel and DC universes have so oversaturated us that coming up with anything fresh in this genre is really hard.

If you are a fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, you likely have already seen it. If you have no interest in the subject, or have tired of the Matter Of Earth-616, my semi-synopsis would serve no purpose. Instead I am going to make of this review a discussion of one of the primary issues of serious science fiction and high fantasy. I am going to talk about world building, and how movies, being primarily a visual medium accomplish that.In the movies, world-building is done by visual stylists, like Joseph von Sternberg, and nowadays by Benicio del Toro. You can always recognize the works of these two directors. With von Sternberg, it's a matter of the scrim work, the shadows thrown by complicated beadwork, or the curlicues of wood as a drill pokes through elaborately carved woodwork. With del Toro, it's the filled sets, whether it's the Biedermeier furniture, or a tent filled with jars of pickled freaks, or elaborate clockwork mechanisms. In both directors, it's a matter of paying attention to the details, even the details that the audience does not consciously see. For one artist to do it, or even supervise the skilled workers who achieve it, is a wearying and even an insane achievement. Then you must write the story that can be told in that world, and imagine the people who live in that world and enact that story, and find the technicians to put it on film, and the performers to portray them.Is it any wonder that the individual who can do this is so rare, and the misfires so frequent?This movie has a great advantage. First, the world this movie takes place in has been written and drawn, and made into movies by thousands, if not tens of thousands of people over more than eighty years. A world, a society, even a single village, is not made by a single individual. It's made by many people over a length of time. A housing project may be designed by a single man, built by a few. When completed, each unit may be identical. But put people in there, and after a few years, each apartment will be decorated differently, no two alike. That is world-building. It is also one advantage that the Marvel Cinematic Universe has. Every writer, every artist, every technician, every actor has put his or her mark on it, giving that variety that makes up a world that shows that thousand have lived here, if only for a little while. The graveyard has tombstones that have settled and tilted, and the names of the dead erased by wind and water. They are still part of that world.The other advantage that the Marvel Cinematic Universe has is that it is a rich franchise. They spent a quarter of a billion dollars making this movie, hiring many artists and set designers and technicians and skilled actors to dedicate themselves to showing that richness of history and character.And so a world is built well for this movie.You may love this movie. Or you may be utterly indifferent to it. That's fine. There are many movies, many stories which tell tales I am not interested in, or have seen too many times. Tearjerkers do not interest me, although show me a great one and I can appreciate, however coldly, its achievement. World building may not interest you. As an old fan of science fiction and fantasy, I treasure the efforts of those writers and artists, like Hal Clement, Ursula K. Leguin, and Poul Anderson, and M. C. Escher. Each of them could singly build a world that was self-consistent in its own way and make it work to tell a story. Sometimes the story was rote, and sometimes it was poorly told, but the beauty, the artistry, was in building that world. The fact that it took a multitude of people and a fortune to make this movie, does not detract from its successes. In fact, in many ways, it makes it even more impressive."

Great music also, it worked with the film, it never clashed with it, or felt overdone.The acting was quite something, terrific in every corner, two powerhouse performances stood out for me though, Laetitia Wright and Tenoch Huerta, the pair were just incredible, their scenes together were captivating.Really enjoyed it, 8/10."

His actions have brought pressure on Wakanda.The CIA believe that the Wakandans are to blame. Namor hates the surface people.The movie is a bloated mess. There was no going away from the fact the shock death of Boseman left Marvel Films with a creative headache.Letitia Wright who had to be kept off social media due to her ultra religious and anti vax views was never going to be a convincing replacement.Some of the scripting was bad. Agent Everett K Ross (Martin Freeman) finding something important as soon as he arrives at a crime scene when others who were there longer did not. Yet he did not smell a rat.The special effects looked shoddy as well. I did not expect such obvious CGI in places.

In case it is unclear: Black Panther Forever as in Best Friends Forever. You very likely have heard of the latter - I made up the former. And while it may feel like I am sort of answering the main question here ... I really am not. The title is even going that extra mile to avoid the question ... of the successor.Now I do assume you have seen the first movie ... and while this of course is playing in the MCU and it makes sense to know all the other entries in that world too ... the one that is most important is the first Black Panther movie. As you may or may not know, Chadwick Boseman passed away (apparently no one knew he was ill while he was out there filming as much things as he could).That leaves quite the big shadow (or shoes) to fill. And the question is if anyone is going to ... and if so ... who that person is going to be. I think you will be able to determine to answer those questions for yourself ... way before the movie is over.That all being said and while this is not the first anything (something that the marketing department was adamant to stress out while the first movie was released), the impact this is having for POC and their perception and how they feel about movies and superheroes is probably something that cannot be measured. Kudos to the Ryan and all involved for making this.It may not further a lot of other things in the MCU (I am surprised this is bookmarked as end of phase 4), but it is quite focused on its story. Having a lot and enough shockers to keep you on the edge of your seat. The action choreography is good, some slow motion may feel weird I reckon ... but it works wonders overall.This is being released in November with Avatar 2 coming out in December - both featuring water a lot ... and ""blue (wo)men"". Not sure if there are even more connections ... well both being released by Disney and having fantastical elements to them of course.This has a strong female component to it. Way more than the first had, which already was filled with it. Great acting too - and a new enemy/friend buried deep and therefor never seen before ... on shore (more puns you say?).The 160 minutes went by like nothing. Not that everything felt like it went smoothly or without any hiccups, but if you suspend your disbelief or have drank the kool-aid like I did ... well you will like it. For a friend of mine who watched this with me (Imax 3D no less), this was the best one after the Spiderman movie in this phase. I have not thought too much about it, but there might be some common ground I share with him on that.Technically looking good and the CGI works overall (although in shots from farther away you can still see when character move way too fast and ""unnatural"") ... I doubt it will be able to hold a candle to Avatar 2 ... the preview alone made me feel like this will set new bars that no one will be able to reach (the first one still is the best 3D movie out there ... 14 years later!) ... Black and Blue Panther ... with enough jokes, drama and action to keep you interested all the time."

And superhero movies also tend to be movies where you just switch off the brain, lean back and munch on a snack while watching the action, something that is required to unwind from time to time.I found the 2018 ""Black Panther"" movie to be adequately entertaining, so of course I also opted to watch the 2022 sequel ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" as I had the opportunity. Though such a movie is hardly worth a cinema admission ticket in my opinion.""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" was not as entertaining as the 2018 predecessor. The narrative in ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" was simply too montonous, slow paced and dragged on for a long time whilst setting up the stage for a showdown between Wakanda and Namor. Lots of talking and character building going on for about two-thirds of the movie, and the showdown was the final third act of the movie. While the action and fighting was fun to watch, it didn't make up for the long two-thirds that laid before it.It was becoming a struggle to keep focus on the screen and keep being interested in the narrative here, at least for me, since there wasn't enough of any action in the first two-thirds of the movie. I was expecting a Marvel superhero movie with lots of action and punches being thrown, and I wasn't in the mindset for a political drama with a lot of character building and setting the stage.The acting performances in the movie were good, but the movie was suffering from not having Chadwick Boseman in the role as the Black Panther. It should be noted, though, that the cast ensemble was good and they had a lot of talented actors and actresses on the cast list.Visually then ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" was good, as Marvel superhero movie usually are. So at least tyou're in for a visual treat. But visuals can only do so much for lifting up a lacking narrative.Running at 2 hours and 41 minutes, and without a properly entertaining script, then ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" was a long and somewhat monotonous affair to sit through. So I guess the 'forever' part of the title was a hint at the narrative as well.""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" is a movie for the fans of the superhero genre, no doubt about it. And for us casual viewers, it was somewhat of a stale foray into the ""Black Panther"" franchise.My rating of director Ryan Coogler's 2022 movie ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" lands on a five out of ten stars."

A fireside chat late one night doesn't quite go to plan though, when they are introduced to an interloper. ""Namor"" (Tenoch Huerta) arrives to ask their help to thwart the Americans who nave managed to design a machine that can trace vibranium, and this has put his hitherto unknown population of underwater, Mesoamerican, people at risk. Either they help him to track down the scientist who created this or there could be war.

The FBI are on soon their trail and skedaddle they must, straight into the arms of the waiting ""Talokan"" who take them to their beautiful watery homeland where we learn just how they evolved. Somewhat narked, the Queen wants her daughter back and that action sows the seeds for a conflict between the two nations that, well, you can guess the rest. Sadly, that's the problem here. Despite a really strong and vibrant performance from Wright and some very fine production values, there is precious little story here. It is far, far, too long to sustain the thin plot and the conflict engineered between the two races is flawed in more ways than an US Congressional election. The pace is really slow, the combat scenes could have been choreographed by Sir Matthew Bourne - or by a Wakandan cheerleader at their equivalent of the ""Superbowl"" - and the supporting characters aren't on screen long enough to give Miss Wright enough help to wade through the frequent tedium. I wasn't helped by Huerta's very thick accent which made his dialogue nigh-on impossible to comprehend at times and the denouement screamed sequel so loudly that I forgot that I'd long given up on any jeopardy at the end two hours ago. There is a bit of character tragedy, character loyalty and thankfully Martin Freeman's (""Ross"" - why does he need an American accent?) appears but sparingly as we go along but Marvel must stop taking the audience for granted. They have to realise that their gorgeous Avatar-esque visual effects and technical wizardry are not going to entertain us indefinitely if the stories continue to deliver so weakly. Great to look at, a few power-ballads from the soundtrack and Wright is certainly a stylish and classy star - otherwise, this is a film nobody will remember in two years time, I'll bet!"

Meanwhile, the world wants the source of Wakanda's power, vibranium. It becomes apparent another source of vibranium is available under water and the world rushes to obtain it, but the Earth doesn't know a civilization is under the Earth to protect it...a civilization stronger than Wakanda and its people.

The big secret was spoiled before the film ever hit theaters, and of course, I won't reveal anything here for those who have managed to avoid the leaks. We do learn the identity of the new Black Panther, complete with action sequences. What really stands out in this sequel to the 2018 original, is that writer-director Ryan Coogler and co-writer Joe Robert Cole return with less action, and more focus on grief, the transition of power, and the introduction of yet another society that has lived undetected for generations.The film opens with the death of King T'Challa from a mysterious illness. We see his mother, Queen Ramonda (Angela Bassett) and his sister Shuri (Letitia Wright) and the whole of Wakanda attending his funeral in a sea of white. Ms. Bassett kicks into dominant Queen Mother mode, while butting heads at times with Shuri in a collision of tradition vs. Science. A couple of sequences make sure we understand that Vibranium remains the most valuable and sought-after natural resource on the globe. Wakanda will stop at nothing to protect their way of life and their corner on the Vibranium market. However, it turns out, it's not a corner they control, but rather one they share with a previously unknown society.The CIA is involved ... in a botched mission of greed, of course ... and this means Agent Everett K Ross (Martin Freeman) continues his communication relationship with Wakanda, which drags the agency director and his ex-wife (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) into the fray. The story has many tentacles and bounces around the globe, mostly to appear complicated and important. Other familiar characters are back, including the fierce Okoye (Danai Gurira, a standout in the first film), M""Baku (Winston Duke, given little to do this time), and super spy Nakia (Lupita N'yongo) who now runs a school in Haiti.New to the proceedings are Dominique Thorne, who plays 19-year-old MIT science and technology whiz, Riri Williams, and especially Tenoch Huerta as Namor, the ruler of the underwater kingdom of Talokan. Not back are Daniel Kaluuya (scheduling conflicts?) and, of course, the late Chadwick Boseman, who passed away in 2020. Director Coogler includes a tribute to Boseman over the opening credits, and another near the film's end.The film is two hours and forty-one minutes long, and definitely drags at times. Still, the attempt at in-depth storytelling is commendable in the Marvel universe, though on a couple of occasions, the interjection of songs are distracting and recall 1980's filmmaking. The underwater segments look somewhat realistic rather than cartoonish, and the reveal of the new Black Panther probably won't surprise many - although the high-profile cameo might. Everything about the movie seems to set the stage for more sequels, all quite likely despite this one not reaching the unattainable level of the original.Opens wide in theaters beginning November 11, 2022."

I wasn't a big fan of the forced accent some of the Afro-Americans had. I'm sure they speak without that accent in real so I don't get why they would do that in this movie, it's not necessary.

This is not about replacing him. About maintaining a stride despite his tragic death. It is about honoring the legacy of him, and his performance as T'Challa. We find the fictional people who were closest to him torn apart by mourning. Each grieving in their own way. It is handled in a mature, intelligent way.As has been the case recently, the MCU continues to use sequels to not only follow up on the story and characters set up earlier in the series and overall franchise, but also introduce new ones. Your mileage may vary, but I was personally extremely impressed by how well it integrated all of them. This shows respect for, and shines a spotlight on, Mayan culture and history, the way that the original did for the African continent. I am very happy that they changed the location from the fictional Atlantis. Like Wakanda, Talocan genuinely feels like a place where people live and work. It's not just a cool setting that feels like a stage. Namor(Huerta, by turns charismatic and intense) is as fascinating and complex as in the comics, and there's no end to the narratives that they can explore now that he is part of this universe.This features sci-fi violence and a little moderate to strong language.

They needed to not only craft a compelling experience that's both entertaining and emotionally resonant, but also respectfully provide a suitable replacement for Boseman who can take up the Black Panther mantle in future sequels. They had to do this this in a fairly tight timeframe, while also radically altering their initial plans and grappling with their own unexpected loss of a colleague and friend as they continued work on a film that he should have been a part of. Plus, they had to transpose their own pain onto the characters, be it from a writing or performance point of view, which can't have been an easy thing to do. This, of course, is an unenviable task, so I can't blame them too much for the perhaps unsurprising fact that they don't really succeed in doing what they set out to. The end result of their admirable effort is, sadly, underwhelming.Overlong and largely uninspired, this laboriously paced picture feels extremely flat. Picking up a year after King T'Challa's off-screen passing, it finds its characters struggling to contend with Wakanda's new place in the world while grieving the loss of their beloved Black Panther. Soon, a new threat emerges from the ocean: Namor, who hails from a watery Wakandan counterpart known as Talokan, flies up to the Queen on his little ankle wings and demands an alliance in his upcoming war with the surface, lest there be dire consequences. The narrative is mostly concerned with Shuri's attempts to maintain peace between the two kingdoms, while also protecting a young inventor who has been targeted by Talokan assassins for reasons I won't get into. It attempts to examine the moral complexities that come with ruling an entire country, while also constantly commenting on the grief that overshadows its plot's events and the ways in which it affects the core characters. However, the flick is generally thematically weak and it isn't even all that moving. There are some emotionally resonant moments, don't get me wrong, but the mournful, generally bleak tone doesn't lend itself to this sort of story, especially since it continues into the action sequences. The slower pace doesn't lead to introspection, it simply saps almost all the energy from the affair. To be honest, it's all just a bit dull. Some of its scripting is notably bad, too. The set-pieces aren't even all that exciting, with the climax being especially disappointing in that regard. There's no real charisma to any aspect of the production, even though a lot of it is undeniably well achieved, and the whole thing just leaves you feeling deflated.That's not the intention, either. This is primarily a movie about grief and processing loss, but it isn't intended to be a wholly downbeat experience. It has moments of hope and catharsis, as well as sadness and rage, and it often attempts to deliver the genre thrills expected of it. It seems to be juggling too many things, really, even though it isn't actually all that complex when you think in about it. It's not all bad, though. The performances, for example, are strong across the board, with some notable standouts certifiably commanding the screen on more than one occasion. The film also uses quite a lot of subtitled non-English (including Spanish, French, !Xhosa and Talokanin), which goes hand in hand with its excellent casting of minority actors and leads to a wonderfully inclusive experience. The set and costume design is intricate and vibrant, while the visual effects are mostly engaging (until they're really not). Having said that, the inevitable comparisons between this and 'Avatar: The Way Of Water (2022)' when it comes to their sea-dwelling, whale-riding blue people are certainly not going to be in this movie's favour. Heck, even 'Aquaman (2018)' manages to create a more colourful and compelling underwater world than this does, although the approach is purposefully more muted and, I suppose, realistic here.Overall, although this is an admirable effort, there's very little that truly works about the piece. It has its moments, but mostly it's too long, too bland and too underwhelming for its own good. You kind of get the sense that they should have just left it alone."

Movie Review :-Chadwick Boseman's departure made things very difficult for the Black Panther sequel, not just in terms of casting but also theoretically. Black Panther was a highly successful film because it represented the meeting of American and African cultures in the Marvel universe. I couldn't believe it for a second that a standalone superhero flick like Black Panther earned more than Avengers: Infinity War at the American box office. But that's what describes its popularity, no. Now that Chadwick is gone, it was a big task for the makers to live up to the standard set by him as a character and as a film too. Marvel knows how to make sequels and how to take stories forward, and they did exactly that with Ryan Coogler's superhero saga. Wakanda Forever is somewhat slow but steady sequel that gives new rise to the entire Wakanda universe in the MCU.The film begins with T'Challa's death, and then his mother, Ramonda (Angela Bassett), takes charge as the Queen, who is secretly grieving her big personal loss. Wakanda is left without their protector and most powerful person, Black Panther, when they are attacked by Namor (Tenoch Huerta). Namor also has the same vibranium powers, but he has set his kingdom underwater. An MIT student, Riri (Dominique Thorne), builds a machine that can help the Americans trace vibranium, which is the main reason why Namor wants her dead. However, he has to tackle the Wakandians who stand beside Riri. So it's a three-way battle, but only two sides have to settle things first. Will Wakanda survive against powerful Namor without their protector, or will there be a new hero for them?Wakanda Forever is a well-written script, and Ryan really knew where to spill the dice. He, along with Joe Robert Cole, has written a solid screenplay that compiles the usual conflicts of a superhero flick with human emotions, family drama, and social conscience very well. It takes time to settle, which is fair enough because it isn't a typical money-spinner franchise for Marvel. Black Panther is supposed to be story-driven, unlike other superheroes in the Marvel Universe, and that's what they have tried to do there. Even so, it still has a few flaws that can't be overlooked. A few scenes follow the same tantrums from days gone by, and the heroism is missing too (even with females). Nevertheless, there are more good things than bad, so the battle is won.Black Panther: Wakanda Forever has more female characters than male ones, so it wouldn't be inappropriate to say that the females are the top performers here. Letitia Wright as Shuri takes the lead here. I kind of liked her in the first Black Panther film more than any other supporting character in any Marvel film. There was some excitement about her character, and then the tech-savvy boost really made me fall in love with it. Wakanda Forever takes that away, which is sad, but it brings her to the front, which is the best thing that happened to her. Tenoch Huerta's sexy body and physical appeal speak more than dialogues, and even the attitude is fine. The two supporting pillars of T'Challa's life, his mother, played by Angela Bassett, and his lover, played by Lupita Nyong'o, also deliver a steady performance. Danai Gurira, Winston Duke, Dominique Thorne, Florence Kasumba, Michaela Coel, and Martin Freeman's support are excellent throughout the film.Wakanda Forever is not a heavy VFX film (it was never supposed to be one even in the previous appearances of the superhero), but the action scenes are well executed. They are fewer in number, and with a long runtime of 160 minutes, it is definitely too little. The framework of Autumn Durald Arkapaw is quite fascinating, as the film has so many underwater scenes and many ashore. That ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" feeling has arrived a month earlier. Some may argue, but the editing could have been more crisp, in my opinion. Ryan Coogler knew that he had to carry Boseman's references along with the new story, and he has done a superb job there. Watch out for the surprise in the end credit scene. Wakanda Forever stands steady as an individual film of its own, and you have to watch it for that. It does not include much of the outer world or even the other Avengers like every other Marvel film, so just keep that in mind. It's a wholesome 'Black Panther' film and nothing else, but the emotional quotient adds extra to your viewing experience.RATING - 6/10*"

In order to somehow fix this broken continuity, Wakanda Forever was born, but it feels like a movie made by committee (which it probably was). It has good acting, but choppy plot. It has things appearing out of nowhere when the story needs them and characters that behave inconsistently throughout the film. It has problems in editing! At one point the music just glitches because they removed a scene late in postproduction, probably. It has women of color running everything: Black female Panther, Black female Ironman, Black female Black Widow, Black female Queen. It's not that it hurts the story in anyway, but it gives the impression that they dumped everything they had in this film just to make it not suck. I mean, they added Mexicans, too. They were trying to take the Wakandan jobs. Ok, bad joke, but the whole concept felt more racist than whatever I can say.It's not a totally bad movie, taken as a standalone, but in the context of so much source material and so many previous good MCU films, it does suck. The best part was Lupita Nyong'o. Her character weas interesting and she is so beautiful!In the end they drop a post-credits scene that ensures the possibility of a replacement for Chadwick, but I don't see how, unless they add some ""go to ancestral land and return 20 years older"" plot.Bottom line: compared to the first Black Panther movie, this film was accompanied by overwhelming silence. It's easy to find things to make fun of in it, but the fact that not many people even bothered says a lot. This is a run of the mill, committee approved flatliner."

Chadwick starred as Black Panther in the original film and was set to return. Upon his death, the entire script had to be rewritten. The result is a mess of a film.The film pays tribute to Chadwick Boseman and the beginning explains his absence from this sequel. I understand the need to pay tribute to him, but they do this for the entire movie. No offence and with all due respect, it does become tiresome hearing the cast constantly talking about ""mourning their loss"".Ok, with that out the way, 2022 saw the release of two films featuring blue people living in the ocean: this movie, and 'Avatar: The Way of Water'. Yup, there are blue people in 'Black Panther: Wakanda Forever'. Vibranium can be used to make weapons that can go undetected through metal detectors. Vibranium comes from a meteorite that crashed to Earth, and the reason it can only be found in Wakanda. The Wakandans will do everything in their power to protect it, and wants to keep it from the rest of the world.But now antagonist Namor (Tenoch Huerta) also wants the vibranium, or he will launch a war on Wakanda. He comes from the undersea kingdom of Talokan, and he is a powerful entity. His back story is told, but this villain was so uninteresting that I didn't care much. (He does look good in those green undies, though). Oh, and there's a 19-year old scientist named Riri who built a vibranium detector - as part of a school project!! (Allow me to compose myself while I try to stop laughing!!). Oh wait, this 19-year old girl also built an Iron man suit!!! (oh, there I go laughing again shaking my head in disbelief at the stupidity!!) So, we have an Iron Man wannabe, an Aquaman wannabe, and blue Avatar look-alikes in ONE film...But there's no Black Panther in the Black Panther film!!! Hell, wait, the bad acting princess Shuri (Letitia Wright) takes a shot at becoming Black Panther towards the end... What a joke!Man, this was a silly, silly, silly script! All attempts at humour failed miserably, and were ever so annoying! And what silly dialogue! Hell, everything about this movie was just silly. I didn't like the first film, and I think I liked this one even less. (Is that possible, since I disliked BOTH?).Some of the visual effects were good, but some were cartoonish. Many of the gadgets and magic in the film were downright laughably stupid! I literally sat there thinking what the bloody hell! The best effects and visuals by far were the water grenades; they were awesome! What else did I like here? The costumes! The costume design was fantastic and worthy of an Oscar. As for the film, I hated it. It was overlong, uninteresting, and boring. I'm so done with Black Panther!"

I particularly enjoyed the scenes involving Ramonda because Angela Bassett is so magnetic on screen and Letitia Wright does good job of leading the majority of the film.I like the concept of the Talokan and this aspect of the story plays out to a fairly logical conclusion. It's good that certain arcs are left open for future stories, but for me it slightly retreads familiar ground to the original by involving Wakanda in another conflict with an aggrieved supervillain looking to right the wrongs of history.Where I struggle is the general pacing and length of the story. There is some material that stretches the screen time for the sake of franchise expansion. With the 'Ironheart' streaming show on the horizon, plus other movies, this story has to introduce certain characters and continue the arcs of others and for it me this adds a bloated corporate feel to it. Also a lot of dialogue is dedicated to exposition.A big positive is the cinematography and art design. There are so many cinematic shots and beautifully coloured imagery from Wakanda. Plus Talokan is brought to life extremely well.As with many Marvel movies I have grown tired of the extended action spectacle. I think this movie is another example as so much of it is very familiar, such as Ironman type suits flying about with cuts to faces inside the helmets and Wakandans in cool car chases on foreign soil. Other sequences feel quite cartoonishly over the top."

As in the case of gold in other African nations, they need to protect their wealth. Yet, Wakanda has lost a wealth far greater, their deceased King T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman).Writer/director Ryan Coogler (with co-writer Jake Robert Cole), nurses the melancholy of regret to make another blockbuster addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe that deals with mortality seriously, not casually, as the usual case. With Namor's Latin resemblance, Wakanda Forever also gently extends the Universe.In Wakanda Forever. As he did in Black Panther, Coogler crafts a memorable mythology with sterling actors, gorgeous sets, and colorful costumes. This sequel thrives, despite the tragic loss of Boseman, because it depicts an essentially good people (think the USA) peaceful until roused to national fervor protecting their natural resources and their pride.In the background lies the African history of exploitation and colonial slavery. Wakanda could have been real if not for those barbarians. The best exemplar of the proud fictional nation is its matriarch, Ramonda (Angela Basset), who would rift a loyal general and friend for a battle screwup.The real future of Wakanda is Shuri (Letitia Wright, the late King's sister), whose braininess and boldness promise the ""Forever"" of the title. Because she is modern and openminded, she can dance the diplomacy dance nimbly, especially with the confounding complications of the underwater kingdom.

I can't imagine what it was like for the cast to film those various scenes. But it hurts the overall plot of the film. We've just done overwhelming grief with Wanda and it feels like a bit of a redux to do it again here. It's not the only failure of the plot too, Namor is a great character and it's interesting to see him and his world and its painfully obvious that this is going to be the last time they use him, which hamstrings the resolution of the film. I appreciate that a criticism of the MCU has been too reliant on comedy recently but here, for obvious tonal reasons, its desperately lacking.But it's not a bad film. The other great criticism of the MCU recently has been poor visual effects - that is certainly not the case here as Coogler has created another visually stunning film. It's probably lacking one major action scene, but the ones that are present are pretty good.

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9550179/?ref_=tturv_perm_31,"""Black Panther 2"" is beautiful and emotional, but it is not able to dedicate the necessary attention to developing each one of the several plots with ideal efficiency",,Helpful,•,4,3,fernandoschiavi,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur33162918/?ref_=tturv_usr_31_t,8-Jan-24,7,/10,"""Black Panther 2"" divides its (ambitious) priorities in such a distant way, the film ends up not being able to dedicate the necessary attention to developing each of them with ideal efficiency, making certain key elements of the narrative sound weak and superficial - and it is no surprise that, when the time finally arrives for the protagonist and antagonist to face each other in the third act, the emotional effect caused by that fight never seems to result from an emotional escalation that had been building cohesively throughout the two hours and previous half, sounding, instead, like a technically efficient confrontation, but lacking in dramatic support. To make matters worse, if the 2018 film became an undeniable cultural phenomenon thanks to its surprising thematic ambition and its ability to articulate well the issues it addressed (and which it discussed with remarkable awareness and density), this sequel barely finds time to develop any political topic that it raises with a minimum of depth, collapsing under the weight of its own pretensions - which culminates in a terribly hasty and lazy resolution to the clash between Shuri, Namor and the people they represent (without spoilers, suffice it to say that the script simply decides to throw all the dualities he had been building under the carpet in order to quickly reach an outcome for all that).In this aspect, even as a ""film about grief"" Black Panther 2 does not fully work, since, instead of establishing the feeling in question as a central (or, at least, constant) piece of the entire narrative, the film only finds opportunities to develop the characters' pain here and there, in specific - and very limited - moments of the projection. That doesn't mean, however, that Coogler doesn't achieve moving results, and if there's something that certainly helps put ""Wakanda Forever After"" above the average of recent Marvel productions, it's the fact that most of the emotions the film attempts provoke sound legitimate, resulting from those that those responsible for the work felt in the first place. Thus, when we see Shuri, for example, crying when remembering her brother, the scene is recorded by Coogler with an introspective and melancholic delicacy that manages to bring the viewer to tears (or a lump in the throat, at least) without ever sounding manipulative or schematic - and, speaking of Shuri, it is important to highlight that Letitia Wright does what she can with great competence in both the scope of the action and the drama to give grandeur and dramatic dimension to a character who, until the previous film, was thought to be almost as a comic relief, being successful in embodying the heroine's suffering and doubts in the face of the role she now assumes, while Angela Bassett, even without starring in any action scenes, establishes herself as the most powerful and intense figure in the entire narrative, evoking Queen Mother Ramonda's pain as she deals not only with the sudden loss of her son, but with the threats made to the people she defends.Still, the highlight of this sequel isn't even a resident of Wakanda, but rather the underwater Namor, who takes on the role of the story's real antagonist even without ever becoming a villain. Presented by Ryan Coogler as an individual who, at first glance, does not exude any trace of intimidation (which is interesting, as it creates in the viewer the expectation that that character will be portrayed in a more ""stripped down"" way than the film eventually comes to believe). Portray, making his radical actions even more surprising than they already would be), the king of Talokan is played by Tenoch Huerta Mejía as a suitably unpredictable figure, being efficient as well as demonstrating a legitimate affection for the people he defends ( notice the pain that takes over his face when witnessing the loss of a subject), he also conveys intransigence and threat by vowing to exterminate those who get in his way - or harm him in any way.Obviously, one of the reasons for this change was to distance the character from DC's rival, Aquaman (Jason Momoa). Although Aquaman was inspired by Namor in the comics, the DC character debuted on the big screen before. So, to avoid criticism and accusations from those who don't know the stories, this distance from each other is quite logical. Furthermore, betting on Talocan instead of Atlantis is even a matter of coherence in the MCU, since Greek myths and legends were justified by Eternals (2021). And since they didn't even mention the existence of Namor, it makes sense that they move away from this mythology and focus on an underwater kingdom inspired by Mayan traditions. While Atlantis in ""Aquaman"" was excessively bright and colorful, Talocan has more sober and dark lighting, replicating the feeling of diving into an underwater cave. Not that it bothers you, but after building so many vibrant and colorful magical worlds, it's a brief disappointment that they don't explore the vibrant colors of Mesoamerican art as much to create this kingdom. On the other hand, the water movement of the people is more visually interesting than that proposed by the DC rival. In fact, this society's approach is much more credible. The customs, traditions, and activities of the people on a daily basis. The entire concept of the existence of this population is very well constructed and believable, exploring marine elements and animals as a functional part of this civilization. And as this is just the introduction of this nucleus, there is a colossal expectation for what could be shown in the future.What's more: the fact that he is the leader of a civilization of Aztec origins is fundamental to establish him as a counterpoint to the warriors of Wakanda, since, while this is an African nation that stood out precisely by resisting European colonization, Talokan is an civilization that (literally) succumbed due to the barbarities committed by the Spanish invaders, positioning one fictional country as a distorted reflection of the other - and, therefore, it is appropriate that costume designer Ruth E. Carter brings elements of Aztec culture to the costumes of the Talokanians and that production designer Hannah Beachler portrays the underwater kingdom as an abandoned, uncomfortable environment that only seems to endure thanks to its occupants' persistence in clinging to every scrap of past life they have left, sounding radically different from the hidden paradise that is Wakanda. (That at a given moment a North American agent sees some Talokanian soldiers and, without understanding who they are, deduces that ""They must be the Wakandans"" is something that exposes an obviously racist and generalist view on the part of that person towards foreign peoples - in a comment subtle but effective social-political aspect on the part of the film.) On the other hand, not even this justifies the excessive darkness that takes over most of the night and/or underwater sequences - and there are moments when it is almost impossible to see what is happening in the scene, even when that clearly wasn't Ryan Coogler or cinematographer Autumn Durald Arkapaw's intention.The biggest issue to be addressed in ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" comes from the title itself: if, on the one hand, it takes too long until, finally, a new Black Panther is presented (and, finally, it only appears two hours after the beginning of the film, which in total is more than 180 minutes long) - and, when it happens, it is more due to the conjuncture of events than the result of a natural process of awareness and calling - little attention is also given to the continuity of Wakanda as a state - and cultural phenomenon. After all, since the object they possess, coveted by so many, will not be shared, these others try to divert their attention elsewhere. The clash, therefore, is between the USA and Talokan, without the former, in fact, even being aware of the existence of the latter. Wakanda was just unlucky enough to be in the middle of this dispute. All Namor would have to do was defend what is his, and that's it. What is the need, therefore, to go into confrontation against the only people also in possession of the same benefit? Watching Wakandeans and Talokeans face off is not only disappointing, it's manipulative. After all, there are two oppressed peoples - in an extra-filmic spectrum, it is Latins against Africans - killing each other, while the explorers (North Americans) remain at a safe distance, waiting for the first casualty to collect the remains. Of battle, like profiteering hyenas.As entertainment - it is important not to forget that, after all, it is a superhero film based on comic book characters - ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" is a delight to the eyes, right from the action scenes (Namor demonstrates a strong which deserves to be better utilized in the future), as well as the composition of new scenarios (the underwater world of Talokan is stunning). However, the very points highlighted in this paragraph make the best of the set clear: the newcomers from the bottom of the sea, and not the palace intrigues in a kingdom in the heart of Africa, which would be expected. Both Bassett and Nyong'o could have been explored better, and in the end, there are so many loose ends - what is Okoye's future? What does M'Baku want? What is Martin Freeman doing in the middle of all this? - that what is certain is that only one of the original intentions was achieved. Boseman is gone, and the grief at this unexpected departure is felt from beginning to end. However, not in a way that takes the whole thing forward, as seen in ""Fast and Furious 7 (2015)"", for example. On the contrary, it was made like an anchor, preventing such progress. And as it turned out, it's good not to play with what comes from the depths."

It's been a truly inconsistent run of films. There was the good (Shang-Chi, Spider-Man, some of Dr. Strange 2), the eh (other parts of Dr. Strange 2, Black Widow and Eternals), and the ugly (Thor 4, which is easily the worst MCU movie so far). If this movie had been bad, it might have been enough to make me bail on keeping up with the MCU's movies, and truth be told, I've already bailed on the Disney+ series', because WandaVision, Falcon & Winter Soldier, and Loki really didn't do it for me.If you're expecting Black Panther 2 to wrap up Phase 4, you might be disappointed. But then again, there hasn't been a consistent narrative to the last two years of Marvel releases, so there's really nothing to conclude, overall. Importantly, it's just a very good movie, and that's enough to ensure it ends Phase 4 on a high. It's not a total slam-dunk, but there's a great deal about Black Panther 2 that's extremely effective, and enough great stuff that I feel the overall movie is a strong one.I think the pacing is its greatest strength. I really didn't feel the 2 hour 40 minute runtime. The opening half-hour doesn't flow the best, but there was a need to adjust after Chadwick Boseman's passing meant T'Challa died, too. Once the movie establishes this and sets up its main plot, it's pretty smooth-sailing, and unlike many Marvel movies, it saves its most emotional moments and best action scenes for its excellent final hour.It's a very emotional movie, and the way it pays respect to Boseman and T'Challa is essentially perfect. With good action, a solid story, a very good new antagonist (Namor and the whole underworld were great), and fantastic music (maybe the best Marvel score so far?), this was a very good MCU movie, and gives me a little more hope for the franchise going forward."

BP beat you to the punch.WOW, talk about Redemption. As much as I missed the incredible Chadwick Boseman in the title role, this sequel is 10x the movie the first one was. The first Black Panther solo project was good and had incredible performances all around, but the story was so vastly meh and unoriginal. While the story wasn't perfect in BP2, it was much more compelling and engaging.NO SPOILER, but since Chadwick Boseman died in real-life, his iconic Black Panther character, aka T'Challa of Wakanda, also died. The movie deals with his loss and the vulnerable and scattered kingdom he left behind. In comes a previously unknown underwater kingdom to pose a threat to both Wakanda and the remaining population of Earth. Will a hero rise from the ashes of T'Challa?I hate all trailers. They spoil way too much, usually on purpose. The only time I see them, is when I'm practically held hostage before a movie theatre experience and even then, I rarely pay attention or look away. At anything else. Especially for movies I want to see. I wasn't at all excited to see BP2, so I didn't mind seeing the trailer and WOW. That had to be the most depressing trailer I've ever seen. Sure, Chadwick died and that was tragic, but when I see a Superhero trailer, I prefer to be amazed and in awe...not left miserable. Mercifully, the trailer is just the beginning of the feature presentation and they do move on swiftly. (Though, they still manage to spoil some great scenes.)I was grateful for that. The movie, while playing really hard with the passing of the king, did move on and into the story of the aftermath. And while no discredit to Chadwick, he did have an enormous amount of charisma in the original and stole every scene he was in. BP2 REALLY allowed all the other great actors from Part 1 to shine. And Bright.Especially Letitia Wright as Shuri and the ALWAYS MAGNIFICENT Angela Bassett as the Queen. That's not to say there weren't other great performances, including the ""antagonist,"" Tenoch Huerta as Namor, also known as the Sub-Mariner. (Helps he was gorgeous and shirtless the whole time, but that's neither here nor there.)I even loved how separated this movie was from the MCU. The references to other MCU movies were minimal at best and this was VASTLY welcomed. If I have to hear about Thanos and his snap one more time...I digress. This movie looked great and even though it was super long, for the most part, it wasn't felt. I will say I did have a huge problem with the editing and scene transitions - of which there were none. Scenes just abruptly stopped and we're suddenly somewhere else which led me to think ""Oh, I guess we're here now."" That and how the last half wasn't anywhere as good as the first half made me rate this movie not too high, but high enough to show I really did enjoy myself from beginning to end.The MCU has NOT been hitting the same homeruns since before Endgame, but it does have its charms. Spider-Man: No Way Home is my personal 2nd favorite MCU movie and I did even enjoy Thor: Love & Thunder (#9) and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (#10.) But, the rest of the post-endgame films, excluding this one, are mediocre at best.I'm proud to admit, of all MCU movies so far, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is now the 8th best. Not bad for a 30-deep mega-series.***Final Thoughts: THANK GOD this handled Chadwick's real death as part of the storyline here. Not to mention gracefully and respectfully. One of the biggest problems I had with both the Fast & Furious and Star Wars franchises was how they treated their major stars' real-life deaths. They DIDN'T. How they're writing out/around the character of Brian (played by the late Paul Walker) is absolutely ridiculous and disrespectful. (The CGI-Walker was creepy af, to boot.) And the late Carrie Fisher's Leia had a fantastic out for her onscreen death, but instead they made her into a cartoon, gave her a soap opera coma and wrongfully and cartoonishly kept her story going until they finally did conclude her saga. (The CGI-Fisher was creepy af, to boot.) BP2 finally did the right thing...even without the crappy CGI."

First and one of the most sad things was passing of a beloved actor. But i think creators could have come up with better story because story was the most boring part of ""Wakanda Forever"". Also I didn't care about any of characters in the movie, including kind of lackluster villain. Main heroes weren't just to interesting in a first place. Action scenes were generic and have been seen many times. And at running time 2 h 45 min this movie was way to long for the story it wanted to tell - pacing wasn't good either.Overall, ""Wakanda Forever"" was a big disappointment for me.

However, the plot is thinly spread out over its tedious runtime instead of being consolidated into a tighter narrative and is also undermined by its bland execution, uninspiring action & dry effects.There is hardly any sense of awe & wonder evident in its spectacle, the underwater kingdom is surprisingly unappealing, and even the action scenes are terribly choreographed. The film was doing better when addressing Wakanda getting challenged by intervening world powers during its state of mourning. Still, the performances help keep things afloat and Angela Bassett steals the show with a commanding showcase.Overall, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is an inferior follow-up that also qualifies as Coogler's weakest directorial effort to date. The story begins with plenty of potential but it fizzles out as it trudges the 161 mins runtime with nothing new or exciting to offer. A mediocre entry in what has been a mediocre phase for Marvel Studios, their latest offering is another forgettable dud in the canon that impresses & entertains in only bits n pieces."

It is impressive, effects wise, although we are accustomed to that now and the performances particularly from Angels Bassett are solid.

Unfortunately since the passing of Chadwick Boseman, the cinematic elephant in the room before the film's release was how're they going to handle his passing since a recasting of the role was going to be considered an affront to Boseman's memory so dealing w/his character's passing, a sudden ailment which his sister Letitia Wright's brilliant scientist can't solve proves an ample subplot for her to deal w/his death since Wakanda needs a Panther & the flowers which create the hero were destroyed by Killmonger, Michael B. Jordan, in the last entry putting us in a place where scientific might may not trump tradition. Adding to the drama is the world's attempts to usurp Wakanda's hold on vibranium, the appearance of the mutant Namor (masterfully now rooted in Aztec mythology) who fears land dwellers will come to his kingdom seeking the powerful ore & also ReRe Williams, Dominque Thorne, a young genius following in the footsteps of Tony Stark, who's constructed a vibranium detector which has been co-opted by the American government which puts her on a death list penned by Namor. All of this climaxes on a troop barge where the seemingly insurmountable ocean dwellers are spurred back from the remaining Wakandan forces (after a flooding decimates the nation) where a Black Panther stands tall once again to not only right some wrongs but keep the world in their respective corners. Ryan Coogler again proves himself to be the biggest kid on the cinematic block by weaving a nearly 3 hour narrative into something thoughtful, inspiring & ultimately soul searching as viewers grapple w/the multitude of emotions being explored here."

That feeling lasted minutes after the beginning of the movie and changed into excitement. The direction that was made by Ryan Coogler was very difficult but also very good and I believe that he succeeded on connecting the previous events with this movie. The interpretations of Letitia Wright who played as Shuri, Lupita Nyong'o who played as Nakia and Danai Gurira who played as Okoye were absolutely magnificent.

When a CIA team use new technology to track Vibranium to a source in the Atlantic Ocean, this spurs the wrath of Namor (Tenoch Huerta Mejia), the king of the underwater civilization of Talokan that holds a grudge against the surface as the Talokans are descendants of massacred and enslaved Mesoamericans. With his sighs on war with the surface world, Namor approaches the Wakandans about an alliance against the world superpowers who want Vibranium and won't take no for an answer as the Wakandans try to save Riri Williams (Dominique Thorne), a young tech prodigy who invented the Vibranium detector, from both the Talokans and the American government.Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is the long awaited follow-up to 2018's Black Panther which broke several records upon its release and became a bonified hit earning $1 billion worldwide and rave praise for star Chadwick Boseman positioning him not only as a fan favorite in the MCU but also an up and coming A-lister. While a sequel was planned, things took a tragic turn when Boseman tragically lost his life in August 2020 after having a prolonged battle with cancer. Various options were discussed between director Ryan Coogler and Marvel Studios with the ultimate decision being to not recast T'Challa and instead shift focus to the nation of Wakanda itself and how it deals with the loss of their king and essentially making the film a tribute to Boseman. While not the record breaker its predecessor was, the movie made a respectable $860 million against a $200 million budget and as a tribute to the gone too soon Boseman it's undeniably heartfelt even if the movie does feel a little overstuffed and unfocused to a degree.Regardless of how they went about doing it, the follow-up to Black Panther was going to have an uphill battle. The movie wisely keeps T'Challa's illness vague but with parallels to the suddenness of Boseman's real life death but it never feels exploitative or ill judged in its handling of the subject. The scenes that are placed throughout the movie with the characters discussing or experiencing their grief are well done and the ending in particular is incredibly heartfelt and feels like a fitting goodbye to both T'Challa and Boseman. The fact that the original Black Panther had a strong supporting cast of proven actors and actresses means there's plenty of talent to carry the movie and there's a strong emotional throughline for the cast. Tenoch Huerta Mejia is a great antagonist as Namor and despite inevitable comparisons to Jason Momoa's Aquaman turns, Mejia is given enough to give us a different take on this character with his strong ties to Mesoamerican culture which gives him established ground with the Wakandans as a dark reflection for them to face off against. I do feel like there's a little too much plot in Wakanda Forever and elements like the Americans and European nations staging black ops missions to obtain Vibranium does feel like it's edged out by the other plotlines in the film with Martin Freeman reprising his Everett K. Ross role in greatly reduced capacity along with Julia Louis-Dreyfus appearing as Valentina Allegra de Fontaine which felt unneeded to a degree, but I did feel like at least they gave us a better explanation of who de Fontaine is which is more than Black Widow and The Falcon and the Winter Soldier did.Black Panther: Wakanda Forever carries a heavy responsibility in saying farewell to Chadwick Boseman and for all intents and purposes it successfully does so. The movie still feels engaging with themes of revenge and grief but the narrative does feel a bit overcrowded even with a 160 minute runtime. Take that for what you will."

Unfortunately they didn't seem to be backing their new lead to deliver the story without the support of numerous other characters. While there obviously had to be some element of origin story for Shuri (Letitia Wright) as that new lead, taking her Brother T'Challa's place, it really didn't need to be such a long and drawn out process though. One that included an additional origin story that seemed to steal the main focus of the film by introducing Namor, an Atlantean from beneath the sea, who was probably only rushed to be introduced in order to compete with DC's 'Aquaman' (2018) films.Tenoch Huerta didn't exactly wow me as the underwater ruler with wings on his heels either. Whether it was the choice of actor, his general appearance, his screen presence or the direction he received I couldn't say, but to my mind there didn't seem to be enough there to embody such an important character in the Marvel Universe.I did feel that the whole film had become an ensemble piece so that there were too many characters getting screen time and not enough focus on the titular character and the main adversary anyway. The Royal Guard Okoye (Danai Gurira) had a side story as did T'Challa's girlfriend Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o) and even Martin Freeman as Everett Ross, the token American government good guy, seemed to have a story that was building towards something else, which was distracting from the main story.Perhaps in the future the information from this film will lend itself as the perfect bridging between the first one (2018) and the upcoming next instalment, but at this time it just felt cobbled together and rushed out to cinemas without landing on a decent enough script and with no faith in Letitia to bring something new to the role that the fans would still love, just to keep fans from forgetting the 'Black Panther' franchise.It was also a bit slow to start which I didn't blame wholly on the need for reinvention after Chadwick's death, but I did feel that it took too long for the Black Panther to actually arrive on screen. It was like the first films storyline all over again.I didn't need all of that re-establishment, because most of Wakanda and its culture had been clearly defined already.And it didn't need the other new character of super inventor Riri Williams (Dominique Thorne) or her creations to start the story (She's probably going to be the new 'Iron Man' or something?). The war could have started much sooner without her and the story would have flowed better. There was a point halfway through the film, where Namor arrived in Wakanda to cause trouble, that would have been a much better way to start things off following a short period to explain why Shuri hadn't followed up with the Black Panther project until that moment, where she would have realised that it was all down to her. The film could then have continued with her finding her feet in the role and showing how her technical know how would lead to a new type of Panther that didn't solely rely on the mystic flower that had given the generations before her their abilities.They should really just phone me to tell them what to do next time.Production wise it was filmed with a dark filter to the point that I had to turn off my lights to see any movement on screen. I wish the film companies would realise that it doesn't add to the drama, but only frustrates the audience instead. I could barely even make out Namor's appearance when he first arrived on screen. Just pretend it's a full moon or something???The special effects didn't seem quite as clean or quite as special as they had before either. I felt as if the budget had been reduced, because 'Marvel' had just become a film factory instead of something with integrity towards the work. The backdrop's of Wakanda felt obviously drawn and not very realistic, perhaps high definition is making things look too much like the sets that they are too?The underwater movement of the Atlanteans didn't look as slick as it should have for a species that had lived there for centuries either and once again it was too dark.The action that followed was okay, but like the story was not exactly anything very new, which I realise is difficult in a world saturated with media, but I'd rather they didn't make it than they produced stuff for the sake of it and get my hopes up.In general it wasn't so bad that I couldn't bear to watch it, but it fell flat of what it could have been and spent far too much time on the reinvention and not enough on action and furthering the cinematic universe or even just the main character.639.89/1000."

When you try to recall a particular Batman movie, do you try and think back on what Batman's arc was in that film? Of course not, you think back to who the villain was. The biggest problem I had in 'Black Panther: Wakanda Forever' (and in a lot of MCU movies) is that the villains are so forgettable. They never have interesting traits or much to make them unique. They're just the same villain copy and pasted time and time again.I struggled with this film. It's unnecessarily long at 2 hours 41 minutes. To justify a run time like that you have to have incredible pacing and some truly great action sequences. This film had neither of those. There's a lot of talking, none of it interesting, and I can't remember a single action scene from the movie that was notable.There's not much good here at all. The film doesn't have a superhero (or at least it doesn't feel like it does), the story isn't interesting and the villain is style over substance and straight from the cookie cutter.

I believe the studio gave director Ryan Coogler free rein to do whatever he wanted with the film, and it shows in his presentation, which is emotionally satisfying and pays tribute to the late Chadwick Boseman!Unlike conventional Marvel, the narrative here slows down as well as cuts down on the action to give each of the main characters sufficient space to prosper. As a result, not only was the story endowed by compelling characters and performances (Angela Bassett and Danai Gurira were standouts for me), but it also massively contributed to the creation of a beautiful world full of wonders and awe.Here I have a question, was James Cameron involved in the creation of this new world? Was he involved in the process in any way?

I wasn't sure if they would replace the character or just carry on the movies in name only. It was one that I didn't catch in the theater so I watched it at home on Disney+.We start this with a heartfelt remembrance to King T'Challa (Boseman). Shuri (Letitia Wright) tried to save him but failed. Ramonda (Angela Bassett) has assumed being queen again, this time in full control. She is more ruthless than her predecessors. There is good reason though. Other places now that they know Wakanda exists is trying to take advantage of them and get their hands on vibranium.It turns out that they're not the only location on Earth that has this precious metal. Riri (Dominique Thorne) is a student at MIT and she's created a machine that can search for it. The United States' government. This draws the attention of a threat to Wakanda. One that is more advanced and stronger. They're led by Namor (Tenoch Huerta) and this explains what happened to the Mayans. The Wakandians are also faced with the CIA and Valentina Allegra de Fontaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus). If you've watched the Disney+ Marvel shows, she's popped up a few times and is doing things behind the scenes.So that is where I'm going to leave my recap and introduction to the characters. What I'm going to start with is that I remember when this movie was projected to come out. People were wondering who was going to take the mantel of the Black Panther character. Who does is the character that I figured would. It falls in line with what the MCU is going toward and it works for me. I won't spoil things, but it should be obvious in my opinion.Now this one didn't seem to have the same buzz that the original did. It was a big deal, especially for the Black community since they had a superhero that matched their race. This one I think does well in continuing with similar themes. There are jokes made toward Everett Ross (Martin Freeman) about him being a colonizer. We also have Riri and Shuri who are both young Black women who are genius level of intelligence. That adds an element. What I find interesting is that we are pitting Wakanda against Namor's people who are indigenous to Central America. I don't have an issue there, but we are pitting two minority groups against each other.That is where I want to go next, Namor and his crew. I had to look it up as this character is normally a hero. He is the Marvel version of Aquaman. He almost might be one of the first superheroes for Marvel as well. I did find it curious that he's our 'villain' here. They did complicate him though to the point where the lines of both sides are blurred. They both have good reasons to fight and can be problematic. That adds maturity to movies like this for me. I am curious as to where we are going to go next with this character.I will then go to the acting. I'm not sure Wright is as strong an actor as Boseman, but I don't mind her taking over as our lead. She plays well with the strong cast around her. This one brings in Lupita Nyong'o, who I'm a big fan of. We also bring back Danai Gurira, Winston Duke and Bassett. They're all good. I liked Tenoch Huerta as Namor. Freeman, Louis-Dreyfus and Thorne are also good. The cast as I've said is just good. They helps carry this for sure.Then finally will be the filmmaking. This is well-made. I don't know if this is a stylized as the previous one. It still is a fun, popcorn action movie that has a bit more to say underneath the surface. There is a lot of CGI, but I come to expect that. It looks good with that Disney money for sure. There are no issues there. I'd also say that I like the soundtrack. It has an African flair to it that adds more culture. I'd recommend this if you like the original or you're going through the MCU. This is worth at least a watch.My Rating: 7 out of 10."

I thought the Marvel logo was a nice touch.Letitia Wright and Angela Bassett are both good, but I'm not sure where this Oscar nomination talk is coming from. Then again, I didn't think Black Panther should have got a nomination for Best Picture, so she could get one. Winston Duke was a bit wasted as Umkaku, disappointed by what he did at the endThere is no reason for it to be as long as it is. I was bored a few times. I was especially bored during the story between Martin Freeman and Julia Drefuss, it was really weak and unnecessary. Was it just there to put some white people in it? I didn't like the scientist girl, she irritated me and had awful dialogue.

Thankfully I managed to avoid all spoilers, though had heard the name Namor bandied about online so that's all I knew coming into it.Speaking of Namor, I'm a fan. He makes for a cool new character to the universe, as does Talokan as a whole, with Tenoch Huerta a welcomed addition to the cast - first time I recall seeing him in something, and I'm impressed. The star of this 2022 flick, however, is Letitia Wright. I don't really remember her standing out in the original much, at least to me, but here Wright is excellent.Angela Bassett is very good also, there's one emotion-filled speech scene in particular that stands out in my memory. Danai Gurira is always a joy to watch, while Winston Duke and Lupita Nyong'o are the best of the rest - though, the whole cast are good; even Martin Freeman, who I'm not always convinced by.The film handles Boseman's absence nicely, there are some very touching moments in there. I'd say they went the correct way with the character of T'Challa, no-one would've been able to even closely replicate Boseman. The music, meanwhile, is pleasant.I do think this has some relatively minor pacing issues, mainly around the midway point, but other than that I felt more than satisified with what I had just watched when leaving the cinema.

The trademark overbearing humour is restrained but definitely not enough.Letitia Wright rises to meet her uneasy task and gives an incredible lead performance, bringing so much more depth, nuance and emotion to Shuri than ever before and absolutely proving that she is more than capable of being the new lead of this franchise.Angela Bassett and Danai Gurira are both terrific with the most powerful performances of the film. Winston Duke is once again instantly loveable and always a joy to see and Lupita Nyong'o is great but massively underutilized.Tenoch Huerta struggles a little in the shadow of Michael B. Jordan's terrific Killmonger but he still makes Namor a really compelling antagonist with an intimidating presence and more than enough depth, especially for an MCU villain.Ryan Coogler's direction is pretty good overall, the film looks nice with a impressive sense of intimacy for the most part but the action scenes feel bland (apart from a standout car chase early on) and there's a definite overuse of slow motion.As usual the CG is very hit and miss throughout constantly swapping from impressive to poor.

That curiosity may have affected my judgement.The movie is a tribute to the life lost. Boseman was the Black Panther and this movie was about losing the Black Panther and what that did to the nation of Wakanda, which got far more airtime in this movie. Wakanda felt more real here than it did in number one. Now I totally want to go there.Despite being a sequel, Boseman's death makes it feel like they have to start over, so it feels like an origin story. For superhero movies that can slow down the film and technically, the film is telling three at once, which slowed it down a lot. With T'challa making his first appearance in Captain America: Civil War not even Black Panther needed to do this much heavy lifting with the origins.The originally movie had an ensemble cast just like this one, but it's interesting how director Ryan Coogler seemed to film the movie with this notion of how much they needed King T'Challa to be their center piece which ironically made the same ensemble cast that was great in the first one very lackluster in this one. In addition, it is a little over stuff. I loved Julia Louis Dreyfus as Valentina Allegra de Fontaine, but it does feel they could have cut her part to make the film shorter and it would not affect the story at all.Despite that, Wakanda Forever is able to stand alone as a movie, but as a fan of the Marvel Cinematic universe, I could have use more connections to the universe other than a few words here and there. Like I know very little about RiRi Williams but I thought it was strange that the character of Iron Heart did not refer to Iron man in any fashion, or maybe that is just me.I loved what they did with Namor in the film, but honestly, I can see why you would not. If you are a comic book fan you'll noticed that the jerk of an anti-hero screaming ""Imperius Rex!"" as he rightfully seeks vengeance on the surface world is exactly how Tenoch Huerta plays the part, but his background is vastly different than what I recognize from the comic. Change is good, but I have to get use to it so bare with me. Thankfully, it helps that he said those magic words that foreshadow a certain franchise to be integrated into the Marvel Cinematic universe.I feel like I tore this movie apart when I do not think it deserves that. I like it in all but it's not my favorite. Its not as epic as Black Panther."

I did watch most of the films from Phase 4 (barring Eternals) but I was quick to notice that you had to be aware of events from some of the shows to fully comprehend certain plot points. However, the enchanting world of Wakanda wasn't one you could see in any other films, and that somehow made it distinct. Also, the passing of everyone's favourite Chadwick Boseman made me want to know how director Ryan Coogler would move the Wakandans' story forward.Wakanda is still beautiful as ever, but it takes its own sweet time to acknowledge the sorrow and loss from T'Challa's death. It's a recurring theme throughout the film; one that solidifies the decisions taken by Shuri (who's the new Black Panther). It also helps that the key characters we loved from the first film are all given their moments to shine, be it in set-pieces or on the emotional front. The antagonist's entry was powerful but his backstory lacked depth. Danai Gurira (Okoye), Lupita Nyong'o (Nakia), and Angela Bassett (Ramonda) occupy screenspace for all the right reasons.I'm a bit divided on Shuri's sudden ascent to becoming the next Black Panther (even the suit agrees?). The whole scenario plays out too quickly for us to get too excited about it. I didn't care much for the entire episode in the US, or the random addition of Riri Williams / Ironheart. Also, it'd be difficult to look past the resemblances between Avatar 2's Metkayina clan and the Talokan army portrayed in this film, especially given the aquatic setting and the release dates of both. The set-pieces are impressively crafted, and even though they're limited in number, they make you sit up each time. The mid-credits scene is a sweet little tribute, and it succeeds in working our tear glands. Ludwig Göransson's score is pitch-perfect!"

The costumes are intricate and gorgeous; the music is moving; and the acting is just spectacular. I felt captivated during every moment of the film, and the nearly realistic world of Wakanda made me feel like I was there myself, even though it is futuristic and fictional.The storyline follows Princess Shuri (Letita Wright) and the Wakandan army as they fight to protect Wakanda from a new force that threatens to attack their home. After the heartbreaking passing of King T'Challah (Chadwick Boseman), Shuri and her mother Ramonda (Angela Bassett) are left with the weight of the country on their shoulders. They must band together with Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o), General Okoye (Danai Gurira), and young scientist Riri (Domonique Thorne) as they constantly battle to save the only home they know from an otherworldly army, which threatens the secrets of Wakanda's renowned Vibranium. Will they win this excruciating battle, or will Wakanda fall?Letita Wright, as the protagonist, Princess Shuri, performs beautifully. Her acting choices and authentic emotion are captivating. While this film is dark and somber, there is still enough comedy to keep you chuckling, just at the moment when a little happiness feels most necessary. The music in this film is perfectly aligned with every sequence in the story - powerful in battle scenes; sorrowful at moments of loss; and uplifting in moments of triumph. Without the music, viewers would not be so easily transported into Marvel's Wakandan world. The intricate and bedazzled costuming is gorgeous, displaying the marvelous variety of design from diverse cultures around the world. And last, but most certainly not least, the visual effects and CGI are spectacular. The beauty of Wakanda's futuristic world and technology is so real that you can almost touch it.There are many messages in this film, but two stand out to me the most. First, always trust your heart; it will lead you in the right direction no matter how many paths there are to stray from. Second, no one is ever truly gone, they will live for as long as their memory lives inside you. These messages are uplifting for everyone who needs comfort. Although there is violence in this movie, there is not much gore. The use of a variety of weapons makes this film more appropriate for older children and teens.I give Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, plus adults.

Should this franchise have died with Boseman?That's not meant to be disrespectful, quite the opposite, actually. Boseman was the Panther and beyond just playing the roll, he brought something to it that made it resonate with people. Without him... I just don't think this movie works. There's good stuff here, they doubled down on the cultural significance, which is fantastic. The action and cinematography is better. The music is solid. But I am so often just wishing Boseman was in these scenes, anchoring them and making me care.Its also hard to ignore the strangely pervasive Iron Man influence here. As an Iron Man fan, I should be happy about that, but in reality I found myself asking, ""Seriously? Is this just a requirement now? Anyone with significant tech shows that by building an Iron Man-esque suit?"" Again, I didn't hate this movie but it felt like every time I was starting to enjoy something, there would come a counterweight. That's never more obvious than it is in our primary antagonist, a character I very much like yet, while I appreciate what they were trying to do, I just could not get on board with this interpretation.Ultimately, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever seems like a cast of decent supporting characters desperately seeking a lead. These actors are solid, I know they can do great work, but these characters were seemingly never designed to stand on their own two feet. They were only ever meant to be set dressing, accents and facilitators to the main character's journey. Its clear that Shuri is meant to fill that role, but she doesn't and no amount of quips, one liners or robo-pals will fix that.I'd still say this one is worth a watch, but I really don't see myself going back to it again."

The way Suri goes through a difficult period due to the death of her brother T'Chala and the sad origin story of Namor are well written and has a more deep plot in comparison with previous Marvel installments. It can get long and heavy, but that doesn't change the fact that it has a very good story. Good action scenes and special effects as usual, a native style soundtrack and the way the Mayans were projected here, I honestly don't see any fault with this movie. It's highly recommended and my final rating for this movie is a 10/10."

Quite opposite really, but I just found the other parts much better than the acting in this case. The second outing with Wakanda is loaded with spicy performance and every one of them is just as layered and complex as the characters they portray. Gurira is much more than the warrior in this film, she expanded the leader's role to so much more that her character had a more well-rounded tone to play well with the other character. Nyong'o rocks when she shows up, again adding more complexity to what was once two qualities and expanding her character to so much more than what we initially got in the first movie. Her usage was not only well-done, but the woman knows how to play these roles organically and just impose them onto herself to really bring a victory to the acting game. Wright though, wow did she crush the role. Shuri was once sort of the goofy brat of a sister with some harder tones during the less silly moment, but in this film, she really takes a whole new mantle. Wright portrays everything so well, not really straying into territory that is overacted or ridiculous to handle. A point to weigh anchors on, Wright hands down is my favorite of the cast for all that she brought to the character and the chemistry she had with everyone else.The Emotion Thanks to the acting, alongside music, cinematography, and planning, Wakanda forever accomplishes much in diving into the emotional ell. It's a much deeper reflection on real life than the other films, really focusing on the comic aspects of a character facing a hard time in their lives. As the movie progresses, that emotion just extends more, with connections, character arcs, and history that play to a number of audience members to potentially anchor themselves too. That relatability drives the point home, and I found myself going on the journey with them as they fought to face the demons from within, both figuratively and literally to some degree. Caution for those with younger audience members, because the movie is more for the adult audiences than the younger fans might appreciate.The Culture: Again like the first installment, Black Panther's focus on culture and story are always incredible for this reviewer in terms of the natural flow he visualizes them in. The events of this story really thrive on the understanding of so many cultural aspects of the kingdoms and even the world, trying to convey them without becoming too preachy. For the most part, they succeeded for me, really engaging in setting up all the future Marvel settings with a personality and spirit that serves as a foundation for the kingdoms. It pays respects to the real life influences, and makes it as much a character quirk as the characters themselves. This integration really spoke to me, and was again a strong game played by the director and visionary team.The Dramatic And Layered Story: As mentioned above, Wakanda forever is a very heavy story focused moment, with a story layered with drama and growth. It's a movie that takes all the emotion, and evolves it into something I find matching a few of the graphic novel plots I've read. There is connectivity, studying, and understanding of the world, trying to take the grief of a kingdom, and still try to fit into a world constantly on the hunt for power and control. Those themes of course stay, but yet blossom into something else as more and more strategic play occurs, crafting this board of characters for a much deeper story. The ups and downs with the emotional connection mentioned earlier only expands that layer, taking the movie into a more artistic Marvel film than other films have tried in the past.The Messages Are Classy: Given all the culture and politics in the movie, you might expect a lot of political agenda checking in play. To an extent there is, I won't lie at some of the heavy-handed elements that they are pushing. Yet, it's not the worst thing to come out of the Marvel Studio. Black Panther's messages are again presented well, classy and pertinent to the story whose messages extend past beating Thanos. When baked in as well as they were, I found myself really not getting too bogged down by many of the ""empowering"" messages, because they were balanced with the other aspects and helping progress the story. Thus, I give that a win in my book.The Character Development By far, the movie is really a great dive into the character psyche of a Marvel character and giving you a strong character story with it. Black Panther's group are really taken to levels that are rare to see in movies today. The anguish, the torture, and all the feelings are beautifully presented, giving you characters that far extend past the costumes they wear. Like a good soap opera, this movie really explores the facets of human society, providing a window to gaze into and do your own soul searching. And to tie the characters together in such amounts, well I couldn't help but be drawn into the stories these figure had and the journey they took to grow and become something stronger. That right there was perhaps the strongest element of this movie and certainly the lifeline most audience members will become enamored with.DISLIKES:The Pacing: For all the good this movie had though, the pacing was not my favorite in the grand scheme of Marvel movies. At nearly three hours, this movie's slowness could be felt at times, drawn out, a bit boring, and uneven to the point of requiring me to fight off sleep. Certainly the extra layers and character centric story are interesting and deep, but this movie lacks the action kick and props that other Marvel movies do so much better. So much build up and excitement for very exciting elements dwindled to inconsistent moments that felt off to me and sometimes dilated the time effect. It's by far more thrilling than say the Eternals, but, the movie is certainly slower than several other entries in Phase 4.The Action Is A Step Down For Me: One of my biggest disappointments, Black Panther 2 took a step back from the action the first movie brought. Certainly there are cool moves to watch, slow motion spectacles and few choreographed exchanges that I liked. And yet, the consistency and polish of these moments feels off for me in regards to the smoothness of their execution. Like a DC film, the elevated message bled into the fights and led to short lived moments and messy montages that felt hastily edited together in sort of a highlight real. These quick bouts ended abruptly, just did not give our characters the moment in the sun, and kind of felt sloppy or too elevated from what I wanted. All the buildup, the trailers, and the talk sort of died away and even the final fight felt like an afterthought when the drama was done so well.Was Okay With Riri's inclusion: Riri was a character that could have gone either way for me, but her inclusion was fine for the most part. And yet, I don't think it was necessary in the grand scheme of the story. She has potential for many crossover events and tie ins for the future, but in this film, it was another character that seemed somewhat an afterthought for the inclusion. The moments in the story are, okay, holding that empowering message, comedic moments and some other elements that look cool. However, I could also have gotten the meat of this movie without her there, envisioning a version with most of her scenes gone and potentially getting a better movie if they had replaced her with other characteristics.Too Much in One Movie: This is something that I think has become a big focus in Disney's world of franchise establishment. Black Panther's second film is all about introducing a lot of things, setting up a ton of the next phase in an attempt to lay the groundwork for the deluge of stuff coming in the next phase. While it's not quite as big of a springboard as say She-Hulk, it still put a lot of things into the nearly 3 hours, some of which could have waited for another movie or show to do without taking away from the other things. Again, Coogler make a loving movie, but at the same time could have minimized how much was put in so I could enjoy the effects to the fullest.The VERDICT:Did Black Panther 2 live up to the hype? On some levels, it very much did from what I expected of the movie. Coogler really did make an emotional masterpiece, this incredible film that is all about establishing worlds, cultures, and taking a look at the world's problems through a superhero lens. It handles a lot of things well, and integrate life's facets into a very good story that is character centric and relationship building to really evolve roles that were secondary in the first film. That chemistry, that relatability, and the manner to which they shot the film all point to next level story telling in regards to that drama themed story that ABC series do. If you like this, you're going to love this movie, but caution as the movie is a bit more adult paced than the usual movie, and so younger audiences may not like this one or be scared by this one a little. And in that regards, the movie is also not as balanced in terms of entertainment as the first film was in my opinion. Riri was great, but just didn't feel entirely needed, alongside several other components that got touched on. Meanwhile, the pace and the action suffered more for me in this movie and left me a bit more bored if I wasn't caught up in the emotional elements of the movie. I think it handled way too much in one film, and while most was handled beautifully, having all that stuff just did not accomplish the full balance for me. With all this in mind, the movie's scores for me are:Action/Adventure/Drama: 7.5-8.5 depending on the drama
Movie Overall: 7.0."

Director Ryan Coogler and co-writer Joe Robert Cole return here and do a decent enough job paying tribute to the late Chadwick Boseman while trying to forge a path forward in the Black Panther saga.The main plot revolves around the world discovering that another nation has discovered a source of vibranium - previously the exclusive domain of Wakanda. The Talokan are a South American undersea community. Conflict ensues.It's not the most unworkable concept, but, Coogler and Cole drag out every turn in the story. Whenever a plot point is revealed, one can be assured that it will take at least 20 minutes to explain it. It is interesting that the U. S. and most of the rest of the world take a backseat to Wakanda and the Talokan. It does re-arrange one's mindset. Still, any viewer who has even read a review of a superhero film knows that it will all climax in a big battle.The overall production is good with solid tech credits all around particularly a stirring score by Ludwig Goransson who does all he can to make all those expository scenes seem exiting. The cast is strong, as well. There are some cogent takes on duty, revenge and honor, but, in the end, WAKANDA FOREVER is basically: Just another Marvel sequel."

Angela Bassett as Ramonda, Letitia Wright as Shuri, Danai Gurira as Okoye, and Lupita Nyong'o as Nakia all give powerful performances as their roles were expanded from the original movie. Two new actresses joined their ranks -- Michaela Coel as Aneka, and Dominique Thorne as Riri, both stepping up in their hero game.The new anti-hero Namor is played by charismatic Mexican actor Tenoch Huerta. The film gave him the full backstory dating back to the 16th century, telling the origin of his incredible abilities, and even how he got his name. Even if Namor was the main antagonist of the film, Huerta played him as a passionate protector of his undersea city of Talokan and the Vibranium that sustained it. His comics name Submariner has yet to come up.Director Ryan Coogler's production design, costume design and hair and makeup teams outdid themselves in this sequel as they did not only designed Wakanda, but also Talokan. In the comics, Namor's underwater kingdom was called Atlantis, inspired by Greek mythology. However in this new film, Atlantis was given a decidedly Mesoamerican civilzation, from its architecture, costumes, language and culture.Even though lead actor and original Black Panther Chadwick Boseman had already passed away two years, Marvel made this sequel a beautiful tribute to his memory. From the specially altered opening credits all the way up to the emotionally-rich mid-credits scene, and all the scenes in between with lines that looked back on the life and extolled the nobility of T'Challa, Boseman was still very much part of this new film."

The film picks up the story of Wakanda, a fictional African nation, following the death of its ruler, T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman).Plot
The film focuses on the grief and struggle of T'Challa's sister, Shuri (Letitia Wright), as she tries to protect Wakanda from external threats. The main antagonist, Namor (Tenoch Huerta), is introduced as the ruler of the underwater kingdom of Talokan, bringing a new dimension to the conflict.Visuals and Action Sequences
The visuals are stunning, with a focus on the rich cultural heritage of Africa. The action sequences are well-choreographed and visually impressive, particularly underwater scenes that draw inspiration from Mesoamerican cultures.Acting and Characters
Letitia Wright delivers a strong performance as Shuri, stepping into the role of the new Black Panther. Winston Duke continues to impress as M'Baku, while Angela Bassett shines as Ramonda, T'Challa's mother. The introduction of Namor adds a new dimension to the story, although his character falls short of expectations.Script and Dialogue
The script is mixed. While the visuals and action sequences are top-notch, the dialogue and plot feel somewhat contrived at times. The motivations of some characters, particularly Namor, are not fully explored, leaving the audience with a sense of dissatisfaction.Moral and Message
The film explores themes of grief, loss, and the responsibility of leadership. It also touches on issues of colonialism and the need for Wakanda to remain independent. However, the execution of these themes is not always successful.Conclusion
""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" is a visually stunning sequel that honors the legacy of Chadwick Boseman. Despite its flaws in the script and dialogue, the film is worth watching for its stunning visuals and emotional depth.Rating: 7/10."

The way the writers go about tackling this loss is indeed commendable & the actors too in those scenes make it quite memorable as the lines feels connected to the actor than the character he played. Post the demise of their King, the Wakanda is in the mourning state but they are aware of the dangers ahead with respect to greedy nations planning to get their hands on the Vibranium. As they struggle to come into terms with the loss as well as protecting their country, they are unaware of the magnitude of the danger that lies ahead. Enter Namor (for his enemies), King of Talokan. He is someone Wakanda is just not ready to face.Unlike the first movie, the cultural aspects are limited in this one. I for one wanted more intro to Talokan & it's people, culturally to connect with them. Anyways the writers opted for the easy route with a flashback to establish Namor's character. There was too much to unburden when it came to the key Wakandan characters balancing between handling the loss of their King & expanding the story.Once the reveal of the antagonist happens, the story moved unconvincingly. It tried to play to the gallery while attempting to portray a serious plot. Somehow, it didn't deliver on both ends. The action at best was average especially that prolonged sea battle sequence with few underwhelming vfx shots. Wakanda Forever definitely started strongly with that first act effectively showcasing how Ramonda & Shuri are handling their grief. As tame the introduction of Riri was, the following action scene worked well. But thereafter, the movie lost it's direction.With the charm of the first part missing, Wakanda Forever doesn't really hit the same high as it's predecessor.

My Rating 5/10I really enjoyed the original Black Panther and gave it a resounding 9/10 but as often happens with sequels , they usually fail . Especially sequels without its original charismatic hero in this case Chadwick Boseman who played King T'Challa.Of course if Chadwick Boseman had still been alive I'm certain that he would have repeated his famous role and the script would have been better for it.Wakanda Forever commences with the funeral and mourning for T'Challa and then descends into cliche after cliche and unlike the original lacks any originality in my opinion.We have the kidnapping T'Challa's sister Princess Shuri and heir to the throne of Wakanda by one of the most lacklustre villains I've seen in a while named Namor .Namor is an aquatic man who literally flys down the street with wings on his feet.Perhaps under the sea is a new wave in SciFi fantasy with Avatar The Way of Water due out this month I hope that sequel is better than this one.British actor Martin Freeman plays only stands out because he is one of the few caucasian white actors in the film not for his performance as Everett Ross he could have Zoomed his role in as it's just silly.I think just keep it to the 2 fantasy Kingdoms and leave Earth out of it as we're in such a mess of our own .Then of course there's the obligatory battle of two civilisations fighting for the ""precious "" in this case a valuable commodity called Vibranium so it's a no brainer why Vibranium is so valuable?I left before the ending of this 2 hour 41 minute mind numbing overlong saga without really being interested who won the war as not one character really interested me .You can have the best CGI technology and it's impressive in Black Panther Wakander Forever but if you don't have a great screenplay or characters that resonate with your audience it's not a pleasant viewing experience in my view."

WF really had to explore emptiness, loss, grief, and feelings in depth. It does this quite well with several emotionally moving moments and excellent dialogue throughout the film. In doing so we knew this would have to affect somewhere and it happened plotwise that doesn't go as deep and is not as coherent as desirable, although I liked Namor as much as the new culture represented. Talking about acting, Letitia Wright, Angela Bassett, and Lupita Nyong'o are all standouts.In the technical fields, it's even a better film than the 1st. Personally, I loved the score (harmonic elements of the two cultures that perfectly complement each other). The visual effects are better, the sound great, and the production design, hairstyling, and make-up are at a similar level (not impressed by the aquatic world though).In addition to some interesting dark elements, final praise for the use of subtle humor that, once again, contrasts with the typical cheesy humor - pausing for audience laughs - that the MCU uses so much in other films. Not as good as the first, but a necessary film that manages to ensure the continuity of the franchise on a positive note."

It felt fresh and was one of the best solo movies of MCU. But even with everything great in it, there were some aspects of it that were designed clearly to be on the safe side of the primary target audience of the MCU. With Wakanda Forever, they surpassed the first part in my opinion and became one of the best movies in MCU. Still, by the end of it, even this doesn't stray too far from a point which is not just for the target audience but also probably for the production company itself.Wakanda Forever is excellent in all aspects of it portraying the imperialistic nature of not just the past but the present superpowers and how that primarily drives the violence ensuing in places where they don't even have to approach directly. At the same time, the film is a fitting tribute to Chadwick Boseman and his character. There were a few pleasant surprises in there too which I was very glad to see. By the beginning of the third act, I was convinced this is probably THE best MCU film depending on how they chose to end it. But even though the third act wasn't bad per se, it showed how the makers are still in the trappings of the studio system where the blame is passed around through individual failings and an invisible system rather than the enablers and the idealogues of the system. This is still one of the best MCU films and I love how the MCUness relatively limited in this film."

The evolution of Shuri's character is deep and the introduction of Namor's character is interesting, but the script is not exempt from being repetitive and making the film unnecessarily long. The CGI special effects feature elements that are well done and others that look quite fake. The editing work is very good and emphasizes the central theme already mentioned above, the loss of a loved one.

To its credit, though, Wakanda Forever was burdened with finding an in-universe replacement for the titular Black Panther after the untimely passing of Chadwick Boseman. However, considering how most of Phase 4 was passing the mantle from one hero to the next generation, it fits well within this theming.There's a line in Avengers: Endgame (2019) where Naka (Lupita Nyong'o) states that Wakanda is aware of an anomaly on the ocean floor near their country and that they were handling it. This throwaway line was likely played for laughs, but it's peculiar how Wakanda was woefully unprepared for the invasion of their land by underwater enemies, even though they clearly knew about it three years ago. Phase 4 of the MCU has highlighted how difficult it is to maintain continuity in a franchise as huge as it has become.Even though Marvel has introduced new characters in movies outside their own standalone works since the early Phases, I would have liked something more dedicated to introducing Ironheart (Dominique Thorne) considering how influential Iron Man was to the MCU. I also would have appreciated action sequences that weren't so dark or hard to follow, because I can't honestly recall any of them that happened in this movie.

The makers of the Black Panther series of films for the MCU had a difficult task to accomplish. How do they pay tribute to their lost lead while also leading the series in a new direction? In the end, they ultimately decided to lean INTO (and not away from) his passing - and your emotional involvement in this film will be predicated on how you react to this, for basing an entire SuperHero Movie on grief and longing for a return to the past is not going to make the ""feel good movie of the year"".Directed and Written (with Joe Robert Cole) by Ryan Coogler (he of the first BLACK PANTHER film), BLACK PANTHER:WAKANDA FOREVER starts on a somber note with the off-screen passing of King T'Chala and the grief and celebration of life for him by his Sister Suri (Letitia Wright) and Mother Queen Ramonda (Angela Basset), both of whom are reprising their roles from previous MCU outings. This is all well and good and Basset, especially, shines in these early parts of the film for she is one of the best actresses working today and she rises above the material (and, if I'm honest, the other actors on the screen) to show actual grief and sorrow on the screen. Some are calling for her to be nominated for an Oscar for this role and she would be a deserved recipient of this.With that out of the way, it's time for this film to move on to it's current adventure and the emergence of a new Black Panther. But, Coogler doesn't do that, he hangs onto the grief, anger and sorrow that is being felt and this mood permeates the entire film - to, ultimately, it's detriment.Newcomer (at least to the MCU) Tenoch Huerta (THE FOREVER PURGE) shows up as Namor, the Sub-Mariner, the villain of the piece and he is formidable enough but with the lack of a Black Panther to battle him, it doesn't seem like a fair fight. Suri, Okoye (Danai Gurira), M'Baku (Winston Duke) and the Dora Milaje (with Florence Kasumba and Michaela Coel being at the forefront - and they are terrific) all are game at the battles and trying to make it to the forefront. But this Wakandan group needed something.They needed Chadwick Boseman.While Angela Bassett was the star power the film needed in the first half of the film, Lupita Nyong'o filled that bill in the 2nd half and it was comforting to see her - and her character, Nakia - back in the MCU.Unfortunately, the character that didn't really gel was the catalyst to the conflict, Riri Williams (and her MCU SuperHero alter-ego Ironheart) played by Dominique Thorne. This character felt tacked onto this story and her Superhero origins were not really explained, so one will just need to ""go with me here"" on this one.Because their is no real emotional center to the battles, they felt like CGI forces fighting CGI forces and the underwater scenery was ""fine"" but nothing special.As stated earlier, this film has a dour, mourning mood to it throughout, making it feel more like a morose DC film than a life-affirming, fun MCU film. So just be prepared for that.BLACK PANTHER: WAKANDA FOREVER should have been titled BLACK PANTHER: WAKANDA MOURNS and it would have been a more accurate title.Letter Grade: B7 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"

Obviously, with the tragic passing of Chadwick Boseman, that just wasn't possible anymore. I figured they would recast the character and continue forward, but they made the tough decision to write the death of the character into the film as well. For that reason, I was worried and relieved all at the same time. It seemed like an impossible task to make a sequel to such a beloved film, but not have the core character there the entire time. Well, after seeing Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, I can confidently say that they handled it as well as they possibly could have. I thought this film was emotional and fantastic, and here's why.Picking up six years after the events of Black Panther (in accordance to the events of Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame), this film focuses heavily on the loss of T'Challa and how the country can move forward without their leader. With the emergence of Namor and the underwater city of Talokan threatening all of Wakanda, the remaining characters must band together and protect their country. Shuri (Letitia Wright) is easily the one with the most screentime here and the burden of carrying this franchise is on her shoulders the whole time. This must have been a daunting task, but she pulled it off. Her character, along with her mother, portrayed incredibly well once again by Angela Basset, are the beating hearts of this film. The emotional aspect of this film got me on a few occasions.Some people may complain about the fact that the death of Chadwick Boseman is basically the jumping-off point for this story to even happen, but I found that it was very tastefully done. With the addition of other characters that will have a future in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, this film was filled to the brim with story. Where I might have my only complaint though, is the fact that this feels like a big budget prelude to what will come next. It's a fantastically made film by director Ryan Coogler and I loved watching every minute of this one, but I have to admit that it did feel like more of a long eulogy for the passing of Boseman.With all of that said though, I'm only complaining about that because I'm reviewing it and criticizing it. That complaint isn't something I will regularly say about this film. They take the time to make a great film on top of that, so it really worked for me overall. I can't wait to see where certain storylines continue later and the fact that I'm excited about that, all while this film is satisfying on its own, is nothing short of great. I wept, I was entertained, and I was engaged in the story at hand, so what else could I really have asked for from this film? Also, the final scene that takes place during the credits is easily one of my favourite post-credit scenes in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It was very well handled. Now playing in theatres, I absolutely recommend checking out Black Panther: Wakanda Forever."

""Black Panther"" (2018) was a Best Picture Nominee. The introduction of Wakanda was a visual spectacle. Chadwick Boseman and Michael B. Jordan both give transcendent performances in the film. So, what do you do for the sequel? How can you recapture the magic of seeing Wakanda for the first time? And most importantly, how do you make a Black Panther movie, when Black Panther died? The tragic death of Chadwick Boseman undoubtably threw a wrench into the original planned sequel. The world may have lost an all-time great actor, Ryan Coogler lost a good friend. The question became, would making a Black Panther 2 be in poor taste. To the movie's credit, they did a solid job playing tribute to the late great Panther. Certainly much better than they did in the other Panther film, ""Trail of the Pink Panther"" (1982). There they just had someone stumble around with bandages around the face claiming to be Peter Sellar's Clouseau. Yeah...they don't do that in this film.Outside of how they play tribute to Boseman, how is the movie itself. It is good, but not great. The underwater city of the Ubuntu isn't as visually appealing as Wakanda. Like water levels in most video games, the underwater parts naturally seem to slow down the pace of the movie.The movie also has elements that feel like the producers added into the story in order to set things up for future Marvel properties. The storyline of Martin Freeman and Elaine feels tacked on and doesn't add much to the story. Characters like IronHeart, are added in here, and I'm sure in future movies might be important, but here they are more of an afterthought. It may be unfair to compare, but Namor isn't as compelling a villain as Killmonger. They show Namor's backstory, and it's fine, but he lacks any personal connection with the hero. His powerset is vague enough that action scenes with him lack much impact.The parts dealing with Wakanda and the political intrigue of different diplomatic decisions is where I feel this movie is at its best. Angela Basset rightfully earned her ""Best Supporting Actress"" nomination, her character goes through so much, and she plays each scene pitch perfect.The action scenes in the movie is a mixed bag. When the movie is doing a smaller action set piece it is well done. The larger action scenes fall short. The car chase, sneak in scenes and fight scenes are all shot and choregraphed well. But, when the movie does larger battle scenes, it has a bit too much going on to keep track of all it needs to.Not Marvel's best movie, but I give credit that Coogler and those involved were able to make it as good as it is."

But on the other, there's a far more authentic, palpable melancholy present from the start that contradicts the lighter joviality we're accustomed to (interspersed throughout) & consequently, that makes the humour seem forced & dishonest - considering the expressions of happiness portrayed aren't as sincere as we're led to believe. Due to this, I can only describe the viewing experience as akin to watching a sanitised depiction of a filmmaker's sorrow; there's a multitude of depth (ironically) brimming beneath the surface (you could even say ""an ocean's worth""), yet little of it is permitted to actually be shown without restraint - in case the intensity of it deters prospective audiences from attending screenings in theatres & alienates cinema-goers.Therein lies the problem; the need to remain marketable (staying consistent with the brand) & the desire to be something else entirely; two immense forces which pull at each other from within & leave this somewhat inconsistent in tone.Then we have the technical aspect & although strong by the normal standards of a corporate project in this saga, when the basic premise involves blue skinned inhabitants of an underwater world warring against the encroaching technological advancements made by man, recklessly pursuing his own militaristic ambitions, parallels will obviously be drawn with James Cameron's ""Avatar"" & when such blatant comparisons are directly made (both thematically & visually)... This does undoubtedly pale, in respect to that.All in all, I don't dislike this follow-up but I'm dissatisfied with it (as it's perhaps dissatisfied with itself) because similarly to the ensemble (who do a commendable amount of soul searching in front of the camera), I'm also unsure as to their motivations & the reasons for the continued existence. Maybe when they figure it out, things will improve... And like any healing process, that comes with time this didn't possess when it was made."

Losing a powerful and beloved character in T'Challa is gut-wrenching. ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" is a tribute to him and the filmmakers approach his death with reverence and respect. In T'Challa's absence, the rest of the characters step up to the plate. His younger sister, Shuri, grapples with grief, doubt, and disbelief in a profound way. His mother, Ramonda, wears her heart on her sleeve and the acting performance by Angela Bassett is one of the best in the MCU.Not only are the returning characters excellent, but the new personalities are equally captivating. The film's antagonist, Namor, is a top-tier foe and he brings the story to a deeper level. His conversations, especially with Shuri, are some of the best moments in the film. Their scenes together are dialogue heavy, but everything said is necessary and thoughtful.Though the music is superb, this film is not afraid of silence. There are multiple, near-silent moments that allow the audience to absorb the story. This technique is not used often in modern filmmaking, and I absolutely loved it.Ryan Coogler, the writer/director of ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"", had a tall task ahead of him when Boseman passed. With the saga's protector gone, where would the narrative go? This lack of surety is felt throughout the movie. This isn't necessarily a bad thing; it just makes for an uneasy and emotional 2 ½ hour journey.There are a few scenes that took place in the United States that drag a bit and did not have much impact on the plot. I found myself less invested whenever the story left Wakanda or Talokan (Namor's home). The scenes involving the CIA and other American characters did not fit the overall narrative and were only there to set up future MCU projects. This movie does not reach the same level as its predecessor, but they did an admirable job.When the credits rolled (after a stunning mid-credit scene) I wanted to ask the projectionist to run it back again. This is only the second movie this year (the first being ""Top Gun: Maverick"") that I wanted to re-watch immediately following my viewing.Unlike other films in Phase 4 of the MCU, this movie did not rely on jokes or over-the-top action sequences. Instead, ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" paid respectful homage to one of the most beloved characters in modern cinema. Without a doubt, there is a hole left where T'Challa used to be, however, Coogler and his team handled his absence with class.Best Character: Namor

Directed and co-written by Ryan Coogler (""Fruitvale Station"", ""Creed""), it pays an appropriately sombre tribute to its recently deceased lead actor by showing how things can still move forward in the wake of his absence.One year after the untimely death of King T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman), the African kingdom of Wakanda is still in mourning as they struggle without their beloved monarch to lead them. T'Challa's younger sister, Princess Shuri (Letitia Wright), feels the immense pressure to take over as ruler but believes she cannot handle such a huge responsibility all by herself. Not long after, the inhabitants of the underwater civilisation of Talokan, led by King Namor (Tenoch Huerta), emerge to wage a war against the surface world. With limited time remaining, the citizens of Wakanda must quickly overcome their grief to put a stop to the Talokan threat before everything is destroyed.After the unfortunate passing of ""Black Panther"" actor Chadwick Boseman in 2020 due to cancer, the MCU was left with a complicated dilemma - should the sequel recast the lead role with a different actor or should they re-write an entirely new story without him? Either of these options would have been a risky move since audiences have become so familiar with Boseman's portrayal of King T'Challa (a.k.a the Black Panther) that it would be near impossible to accept anyone else in the role. It was soon revealed that out of respect for both Boseman and the fans that the latter option was chosen, with the character's in-world demise intended to mirror the actor's real-life death. Now with the release of ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"", we see how all of this has managed to play out, in a follow-up that makes good use of its supporting cast while also remaining respectful to the foundations that have already been laid down.Anybody who saw the 2018 film will remember it has already been established that Wakanda is a place full of interesting characters that have helped this kingdom thrive for so long in seclusion. Because of this, it is believable that its citizens can continue to function without a King due to their personal code of discipline. However, due to their overwhelming admiration for King T'Challa, the Wakandans still feel a sense of emptiness with him no longer being around to lead them and as a result, they are living directionless lives. This is all conveyed to us primarily through the characters that knew T'Challa best and the audience gains a solid understanding of the grief they are each experiencing.I think the film does a decent job of exploring the concept of losing someone you deeply care about, whether it is a close family member or someone you admired from afar. In particular, we get a good look at how Shuri, the next in line to the throne, just cannot bring herself to take her brother's place as the rightful ruler of Wakanda. Despite her lingering heartache, Shuri, along with the rest of Wakanda's de facto leaders, must find a way to set aside her sadness to confront the looming annihilation by advancing enemy forces. Most of the film shows how not only Shuri, but also Okoye (Danai Gurira) and Ramonda (Angela Bassett) all need to work together in order to prevent a major catastrophe from happening. I interpret this plot element as a metaphor for depression as a whole, since rising above intense emotional pain often requires the help of others. Because of that, this is a nice way of telling the audience that no matter how hard things may seem, there will always be others to aid them through their own personal difficulties.Due to the prevalent themes of loss and despair, this is the most melancholic film in the entire MCU library, even more so than the beginning of ""Avengers: Endgame"". Naturally this is a striking departure from the MCU we are all familiar with, which is usually light-hearted and fun for practically everybody. As a result, there are very few moments of comic relief to brighten the mood, and even then it does little to help alleviate the severity of a specific scene. If you are expecting the usual humorous situations that MCU fans have grown accustomed to after all these years or the characters constantly cracking jokes at a convenient time, you are going to be sorely disappointed.This film never wavers on its downbeat tone, with frequent reminders that the original hero is dead and not coming back. Of course, this is entirely understandable considering it would be disrespectful to not take into account Chadwick Boseman's monumental contribution to the series and the film plays along like something crucial is missing without him. Bearing that in mind, the film is still enjoyable in other ways. It does contain a number of good action scenes with some creative fight choreography and a deeper exploration of Wakandan lore to keep the audience invested. These are easily the most entertaining aspects of the film, as they remind us that Wakanda is more than simply the location where the Black Panther character originated. Just don't expect to be smiling too much during these highlights.Out of the three main actors whom the film chooses to focus on, I think Letitia Wright really shone the most as Shuri. Though we have seen Shuri do many important things in previous MCU films, I think it is here where we finally get to see her come into her own. Gone is the confident, meme-quoting sister of King T'Challa and in her place is a mournful, vulnerable young woman who misses her brother and just can't see herself taking his place as leader. Regardless of this shift in personality, Shuri still retains her intelligent side, which is featured much more extensively in this film than we've ever seen before. It's quite impressive to see how well Wright plays into Shuri's insecurities, never once exaggerating her emotions to the point of caricature or melodrama. Instead, she is shown to be a relatable human being, coming to terms with the sudden curveball life has thrown her.Though I must admit, none of this would have worked as well for Wright without the help of Angela Bassett and Danai Gurira as Ramonda and Okoye, respectively. As previously mentioned, they are all dealing with grief in their own unique ways but soon learn that working together to overcome it as a team is the best strategy. These characters feel like a real family, sticking together through what needs to be done to protect Wakanda from anything that threatens their existence. Even with the King no longer around to assist them, these three still prove themselves a formidable force against any hardship they may face.Given the unexpected turn of events surrounding the death of its main star, this film works surprisingly well with its remaining cast members and a more interesting look at Wakanda's place in the MCU. It's hard to say for certain how things may have turned out had Chadwick Boseman lived to reprise his role here, but if I had to guess I would assume we'd have gotten a more optimistic sequel without that feeling of loss hovering over every scene. Personally, I think they made the right decision not to recast and with all of that said, I am nonetheless convinced that Boseman would be pleased to see his legacy honoured in the best way possible under these circumstances. I know I would be.I rate it 8/10."

This sequel is again directed and written in part by Ryan Coogler, who also directed the first part.In the film, the people of Wakanda honor their lost King T'Challa after his tragic death. This leaves Wakanda without their title of warrior Black Panther, making them appear weaker in the eyes of enemy forces. These try to make use of the vibranium, the precious raw material for which the country has become known.Queen Ramonda (Angela Bassett) and Princess Shuri (Letitia Wright) must now join forces with the Dora Milaje led by General Okoye (Danai Gurira) to protect their land. Wakanda is now under attack by a new unknown enemy, who come from the secret underwater world Talokan and are led by Namor (Tenoch Huerta).With this film, Ryan Coogler has made a worthy sequel, but has had a hard time with this. After the tragic death of actor Chadwick Boseman, who played T'Challa and the Black Panther in the first film, they have had to adapt the entire film and the ideas they had for it. Thus, the film conveys well what it can be like to lose a beloved colleague and friend. They also show how hard this can make life because of the enormous emptiness that can arise.With the first Black Panther film, Ryan Coogler successfully introduced a whole new world of fiction into the Marvel film world, reflecting different elements of African cultures. With this film he shows more how African cultures deal with something like the death of a beloved leader. In addition to this culture, in this sequel he now also introduces the underwater world of Talokan. This world reflects some of the Mexican Mayan culture. Unfortunately, this world doesn't come out as clearly as the world of Wakanda in the first film, but as a viewer you understand how most things work here. This world is somewhat reminiscent of the underwater world from the Aquaman film from 2018, but luckily it manages to create a world of its own.Talokan is located in the depths of the ocean and for a more realistic effect Ryan Coogler has also darkened this world much like the real deep environments of the ocean. The film is sometimes a bit too dark so you can't always follow exactly what is happening. The visual effects look good, but sometimes you can still see how they put things with CGI like explosions or the underwater world with a green screen in the film. Also, some characters come across more like they're from an anime or live-action kids TV show like Power Rangers.The acting is well portrayed in the film. Most of the actors who play characters from Wakanda convey well how hard the loss of their king and true friend Chadwick Boseman is. They provide realistic emotional moments. This is especially evident in Letitia Wright and Angela Bassett. Furthermore, Tenoch Huerta also knows how to introduce the character of Namor in the Marvel film world. It is special to see this character for the first time in a live-action film, because this was one of the first original heroes from the Marvel comic book world."

This is coming from someone who thinks the first Black Panther was boring to the point of falling asleep. I think that Marvel has not produced a single good movie in a couple of years, and that all TV shows except for perhaps Ms Marvel have been abysmal failures.This however was on par with Marvel's middle works and this far outshines the first black panther.Not to say this movie does not have many issues. The CGi is still lacking. Marvel used to be the best in the business and if you go back watching the first Iron Man, that computer graphic still holds up today so we know they can do better -- so it highly annoys me that they cannot put in that effort with their latest movies. The female scientific team's sudden scientific solution creating a couple of super-women is very contrived. Speaking of; the over-focus on women is almost bordering on laughable. Everyone is a woman in this movie, except for Namor who also happens to be the best character of the movie... go figure... My final main complaint is the ending, which I am not going to spoil, but again a bit too contrived and a couple of too much moments. I do have a lot of minor complaints too, but nothing that really ruins the movie.With that said Namor is an excellent new character. Just as antagonistic, royal and painfully obnoxious as he is in the comics, although his background story is a bit changed here so a few might complain about that. The acting is great by all involved, and I was definitely not bored. This is mid-tier Marvel and as such I tentatively recommend it.I give the movie a 6/10 and although you can find things to complain about I have to say decent job Marvel, at least this was entertaining...let us hope your slump is now over."

The film excels exploring these themes, but falters a bit with the Ironheart and CIA stuff. Much of this could have been cut to trim down on the massive runtime. Namor's story is another triumph as well. He's a sympathetic villain that will hopefully have big things to do in the future. I am a bit underwhelmed with the person chosen as the new BP, but it makes sense within the story they're telling.Regardless of any story faults, there is an element of artfulness and maturity that Coogler brings which most MCU films lack. The visuals are unmatched in the MCU and the underwater city in particular is a marvel to behold. Ludwig has crafted another Oscar worthy score and the music is great as well. There are several surprises sprinkled throughout. The action is fine, if not terribly impressive. It seems like they just made a less arresting version of the car chase from the first film.Wakanda Forever is largely successful in what it sets out to do, that being grieving over Boseman's death and setting up the future of the franchise."

The premise of the film sees after the death of T'challa, Wakanda is at the mercy of other countries and a force which has chosen now to rise up.Main Character
Letitia Wright gets more of the centre stage as Shuri and her character has changed a plenty. Gone is the fun and charming teenager and in her place is this dark and brooding young woman who is clearly angry at the world. Considering the story the film is trying to tell it works and Wright does a really good job in her role and you clearly see a journey that she goes on in the film.Supporting Characters
Danai Gurira reprises her role as Okoye and she is really good, she is a really talented actress and her character gets some development here. She is good in the action sequences too with her filling this role as a warrior really well. Angela Basset gets a pretty substantial role as Queen Ramonda and this is the performance that most people have been talking about. She is fantastic in her role, you see the pain that comes from her after the events of the previous films and she does a great job in this royal role. Tenoch Huerta makes his debut as Namor and he is fantastic, even though he is technically the antagonist in this film his character is so well written and realised by Huerta that you can't help but kind of see his point of view on things and that is great to see. Dominique Thorne also makes her first appearance as Riri Williams, she is a lot of fun and her performance reminds me of what Shuri was like in the first Black Panther film and I think that was on purpose.Story
The story is incredibly heavy and emotional, it just feels real. The first act in particular feels like a true tribute to Chadwick Boseman and the character of T'Challa. But it also plays into the story and takes this group of broken people and makes them face this threat from a group of people who are also suffering. This is when the film is at its best, but it does have some issues. There is one part of the story that feels really out of place featuring a returning character that just feels shoehorned in. Also the last act had a few things that didn't quite sit well with me and let the film down a bit from a storytelling point of view.Script
The script is incredibly dramatic, this isn't your typical Marvel film and deals with the true consequences of grief and trauma. The jokes are alright but that isn't why we are here, the characters are well written and proper time is given for us to care.Style
The style of the film is a bit of a mixed bag. The soundtrack and overall sound design is really awesome and Ludwig Goransson continues his great streak of awesome music in film & TV. The film looks beautiful too, Wakanda & Talocan (Where Namor lives) are both very vibrant and nice to look out. But I don't know if it was just me who found the majority of the action scenes a bit jarring to watch, especially at the beginning of the film. There is plenty of shaky cam and it doesn't allow these performers to deliver as well as I think they can. Also the film does drag a bit, it is over 2 Hours & 30 Mins and I think a good 10/15 mins could have been cut off and the film would have been better.Overall
Overall, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is a great film that feels like a real classy tribute to Chadwick Boseman but also tells its own story that resonated for me and I think it will any fan of this franchise.Overall - 8/10."

The tribute to Boseman is effectively moving and the story is good and quite mature, but there's nowhere near enough action and it feels like a hodge-podge of lots of other things. The film is slow, long and dull; the action is bland and lacking, the American CIA scenes were completely unnecessary and although there are some visual spectacles in the grand scale, it's never that spectacular. The villain was good, the characters are ok and the tribal elements are colourful, but it just didn't excite, thrill or amaze me the way a superhero movie should."

Somehow, it worked. The sequel tries to do something even harder. Actually, it tries to do a lot of things. Coogler attempts to pay tribute to the late great Chadwick Boseman, to make another story about giant ideas (faith, grief, colonialism), to make a superhero movie without the hero, to elevate a ton of new characters, and to advance the MCU along in the process. It is a lot. Maybe that is why it ended up 2 hours and 40 minutes long. The good news is I was genuinely both entertained and moved at points. The bad news is I also spent too much time either wishing we could move things along, rolling eyes at the over the top technology, or wondering if this was an Avatar crossover event. Basically, some things worked and some things didn't. It was better than the most recent MCU movies I think (and the highs are higher), which says something given everything it tried to do. It was also worse than any other Coogler movie to date, which makes me hope he can do something less franchisey next time around."

Even though I didn't expect much from this movie anyway.So first of all, let me say that they did a good job of sending off Boseman's T'challa, though I actually expected a way longer tribute than what we actually got. But it was a good one nonetheless.I didn't really like having Shuri as BP at first, and I still don't think she really has the same charisma as Chadwick for the main role protagonist, especially as the main Black Panther. It's just that she works better as a side character, at least in this universe and in this movie. But as the movie goes on, they give her more characterization fortunately and she becomes a decent character by the end, and I really don't have a problem with her being the Black Panther now.Though with the unfortunate passing of Chadwick Boseman, his absence is felt big time in this movie, especially in the first and second acts. And that might be what they were going for and you think it helps the movie that there's not a real protagonist yet, but in my opinion, not replacing T'Challa's actor or at least having his wife be the Black Panther really hurt the narrative and the movie as a whole. Because half of the movie passes and you wonder what even happened and who's the protagonist, and like I said, Shuri's actress is just not as charismatic as Boseman was and it hurts the movie. So it might've been a good choice not to recast him, but in my opinion, the negatives in this regard outway the positives, and the first two acts could've benefited from a more charismatic protagonist. And it's not like she doesn't have charisma, they write those first acts in a way that there isn't much focus on her like the movie doesn't even consider her the protagonist either. And again, this might've been intentional to convey the loss, but I didn't appreciate it and would've rather better writing.This made the movie less enjoyable than the first one and the tone of the movie was really weird too. It felt like a fever dream to be honest, it was stuck in a limbo of not being sure whether to be completely somber and serious or be a little light-hearted in between too. Most of the attempts at jokes fail miserably again and some of them feel out of place. This whole thing made the movie feel really weird and not that enjoyable, not to mention the movie was way too long for its own good and could've shaved off a lot of scenes, especially the jokes. Movies like Doctor Strange 2 would've benefited from 20 minutes more and this movie could've benefited from 20 or 10 minutes less. The whole thing kinda feels disjointed for some reason, even though it isn't. So the narrative of this movie is really weird and I liked how they did the first movie way better.Before continuing to point out negative after negative, let me also say what I liked about this movie;And I think that's it, I don't really think I enjoyed the other things in this movie that much.Now back to the negatives and what I didn't like;All in All, I did not enjoy this movie as much as I wanted because I really didn't like the vibe of the movie and the script is not that great. The movie doesn't really take advantage of its lengthy run-time and wastes it on unnecessary scenes. I liked their tribute to Boseman's Black Panther and I liked the ending of the movie a lot, but overall, I didn't enjoy the movie that much and this could've been a way better movie if they had just spent more time fixing the script."

As the Wakandans strive to embrace their next chapter, the heroes must band together with the help of War Dog Nakia and Everett Ross and forge a new path for their nation.Ryan Coogler directed the superhero movie, as well as wrote the screenplay with Joe Robert Cole.THINGS I LIKED:
The fantastic cast includes Lupita Nyongo'o, Letitia Wright, Martin Freeman, Danai Gurira, Winston Duke, Angela Bassett, Tenoch Huerta, and many more!Clearly, Chadwick Boseman will be missed. He was a fantastic actor. His brother has opposed retiring the character and thought that Chadwick would have preferred that the role be simply recast in his absence. The director said that making this movie without Chadwick was the hardest thing he had ever done.Fun fact: The actors who played Talocan actually learned a Mayan language for the movie!This is an incredibly emotional movie
Before filming this movie, Tenoch Huerta didn't know how to swim. When the director asked him if he knew how to swim, Huerta simply replied, ""I've never drowned before.""
This film is absolutely gorgeous to look at.Fantastic costumes.Stunning set designs.Beautiful cinematography.Impressive stuntwork and plenty of action sequences.Super cool technologyTHINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
Some of the CGI doesn't look that great, particularly under the water.The scenes at night time are dark and might be hard to watch on small devices when streaming.This movie is VERY long!Men are completely emasculated in this movie. The big, muscular black men of Wakanda do nothing but stand around. The male villain with superhero powers gets defeated by a skinny, young woman. The only Wakanda warriors who are featured are the women. Why does Hollywood think that the only way women can be shown as powerful is by making all men weak and worthless? As a mother of 4 sons, this narrative infuriates me.Reversing consequences is lazy writing.I loved the closing song by Rihanna called Lift Me Up.As with all Marvel movies, keep watching until the end of the closing credits for a shocking and exciting reveal!TIPS FOR PARENTS:
Lots of violence
Destruction
Some profanity
Talk of death

Less action and more about honoring Black Panther's death, if felt more real considering Chadwick himself passed; it was also more political handling the passing of power and as I did my best to avoid spoilers and teaser trailers, I've found out the big secret was already revealed in a leak. I'll try avoiding the spoilers.As said earlier, this one doesn't not only like focus on wakanda, it widens it's scope to the whole world. It increases the stakes, making it seem like an elaborate plot scheme. I loved that it was evenly matched throughout, Wakanda seemed to have better tech but Talocans seemed to be stronger fighters.Namor had a really cool, mysterious intro. M'baku was hilarious, the movie was generally quite comedic for the first half but unlike other recent marvel movies it fortunately wasn't forced humor. Action felt seldom especially considering the runtime, but after watching the first black panther just before they were better. It's slow paced so this isn't as blood rushing as other marvel movies, don't expect constant tension or fights. Everyone was as good as you'd expect but Angela Bassett gave an amazing performance and stood out. As was the first movie, I still feel like Andy Serkis is an underrated perfect casting.Opening scene honors T'challa and opening credits for Chadwick, it's continued throughout. It had flashbacks and tributes that made the movie more of a farewell to both, everything seemed secondary.I watched this as a double feature with the first back to back and Wakanda Forever is better. I didn't really have high expectations as a lot of Phase 4 productions have disappointed me, and some of the projects that I actually liked were met with criticisms.End Game carried a lot of emotions a closure to Phase three, this has to be the most devotedly emotional in depth marvel movie, not because of the fan love but because it was written that way. Might not be the best at it but for a superhero movie it was. It was a great way to honor Chadwick and a good movie, I however didn't get that feeling leaving the cinema like I had just seen something special. You know, the way you felt after endgame, even though that's a high bar. The movie still does an impressive job and difficult task bettering it's prequel without it's beloved star, delivering the most emotional take in the MCU thus far."

Wakanda Forever's long runtime certainly ebbs and flows, stuttering at times but ultimately building to a thoroughly enjoyable climax. Wright deserves absolute credit for picking up the lead role in the same (previously supporting) character.The plot explains changes seamlessly, without being perfect. The opening 'tribute' scenes aren't too befitting and seem off, but once the introduction of foes come into play, the environment allows recognition of the King's passing as context without withholding the plot from advancing.Namor is a very exciting character to introduce into the MCU, and Huerta grows into the role as the film progresses. Having 'Atlantis' scrapped and replaced by Talokan for fears of confusion with the likes of DC's Aquaman appears weak on Marvel's part though. The appearance of its inhabitants are a little underwhelming too, one of Marvel Comic's first heroes certainly deserved a greater introduction and appearance.Furthermore, Marvel now seemingly jump to a super suit of armour at every opportunity, which adds nothing interesting to the story, and this is the case here. Ironheart does not contribute positively to the plot, the suit itself looks poor due to the MCU's slipping CGI standards, and having just anyone with the ability to create advanced weapons in the style of Iron Man not only piggybacks, but also lessens, the quality of one of the universe's most popular character, Tony Stark.Choreography is impressive, chemistry between characters works well, dialogue solid and overall is more enjoyable than its predecessor."

In 2022's 'Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,' we see what was likely the best attempt that Ryan Coogler could make to try to redirect the still young franchise in a way that both honored the late star and passed the torch to the next generation.Despite the numerous sentimental homages to the original superhero throughout 'Forever,' the film suffers from 'late-era Marvel-itis' - which is nothing new for the recent crop of movies from the MCU. It's bloated, runs forever and lacks a compelling story. There are too many characters competing for screentime, and the last ~45 minutes feel like they belong in an 'Avatar' sequel (or maybe it's just all the blue people...).Letitia Wright does her best to command the story, but she does not yet have the chops to carry a film of this size on her own. Angela Bassett's spectacular performance overshadows Wright's, and despite some respectable supporting roles from Danai Gurira and Lupita Nyong'o, 'Forever' does not have the same gravitas that its predecessor carried.While it's nowhere near the worst thing Marvel has churned out in the Disney era, 'Wakanda Forever' will be viewed at best as a transitional movie that hopefully sets up events for a more exciting third act."

The movie serves as a tribute to the late Chadwick Boseman, who passed away in 2020, and it's clear from the opening moments that his presence is deeply missed.The film is set in the fictional African nation of Wakanda, where T'Challa (Boseman's character) has passed away, and his sister Shuri (Letitia Wright) is struggling to come to terms with his loss. The plot revolves around the various characters trying to honor T'Challa's legacy and protect Wakanda from external threats.The movie features a stellar cast that includes returning favorites like Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, and Winston Duke, as well as new additions like Michaela Coel and Tenoch Huerta. The performances are all top-notch, with each actor bringing their unique voice and energy to their respective roles.The action sequences are also a highlight, with director Ryan Coogler delivering some of the most visually stunning and exciting set pieces ever seen in a superhero movie. The special effects and production design are also remarkable, immersing the viewer in the lush and vibrant world of Wakanda.However, what sets Black Panther: Wakanda Forever apart from other superhero movies is its emotional depth and heart. The movie tackles themes of grief, loss, and legacy in a poignant and resonant way that is sure to leave audiences moved and inspired.Overall, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is a fitting tribute to Chadwick Boseman's legacy and a worthy sequel to the original film. It's a thrilling and emotional ride that will please fans of the genre, but also offers a message of hope and unity that is sorely needed in today's world."

I've never bought into the thought that this film is only around for equality, think that's ridiculous.This film is beautifully handled, at 3 points I cried and I'm not ashamed, they just did things in such a beautiful way, I'd say it was one of my favourite endings to a marvel film, it was just the right tone and a beautiful moment. It gets you wanting this franchise to succeed, a group of talented lovely people who must've gone through an emotional nightmare.The film is long but flies by, the one question was who's the next panther and IMO I thought it was the perfect choice, there was a couple of shocks but it was just really well done. When it's done well like it is here, there's a real joy in seeing badass women take control and fight, it was great in that respect. It wasn't in your face, the choices and logic just made it work, everyone played their part beautifully.Best antagonist for a long while, really creative and it just creates some awesome scenarios, I know some did hards didn't love it because it ventured from the comics but with what happened I think that's fine.

Not his fault really as it was woefully lacking in worth, tension, excitement, interest or quality in any way. My personal thoughts as I sat watching it (fighting hard with myself not to just switch it off) was that if they had no creative outstanding story for a sequel then Hollywood should have stopped just trying to cash in on what they thought would be a successful film franchise; whereas instead they made one of the most disappointing rubbish sequels of a film.They spoilt the memory of a great Black Panther and this will most likely do so bad at the box office that there may not be a third film being made in the future. Its the typical cash in if you can, from people involved in the putting together of the fans heroes, from directors and studios who don't give a toss about the Marvel/DC heroes and heroines; they are there too see if they can amass better wages and high end film contracts.In straight forward simplistic words, ""This was a bloody disgrace and only did damage to a superhero that has never had enough exposure!"

This is a vast improvement over its predecessor offering (2018), if not the best picture to ever come out of the Marvel Universe. It's the kind of film that shows comic book movies can indeed go beyond action sequences and endless explosions to offer viewers something more meaningful and substantial, a result capable of silencing critics like filmmaker Martin Scorsese, who blanketly contend that these releases are without artistic merit. What's more, this second outing in the franchise has undoubtedly saved it from oblivion after losing its lead character in the wake of its initial outing with the untimely death of protagonist Chadwick Boseman. In addition to telling a compelling story, this film provides a credible bridge to the future while fittingly serving as a respectful tribute to its fallen star, one that honors the actor in a way that the movie industry unfortunately never did. Its tactful, reverential treatment of this issue is sure to evoke an emotional response, if not a few tears, in a truly loving but not maudlin way. Beyond that, the narrative and character development in this installment are also a significant cut above the original, telling a more engaging story with deftly nuanced themes that make its predecessor look comparatively simple. It also features fine performances by its ensemble cast, particularly Letitia Wright, Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, and, most notably, Angela Bassett in a genuinely Oscar-worthy portrayal. But what's most impressive is the film's handling of its principal themes, delving into concepts that action-adventure offerings rarely, if ever, do, and certainly not as capably addressed as here (making pictures like ""The Woman King"" appear somewhat amateurish by comparison). To be sure, there are a few elements that might have been handled better (the picture is a little too long, it underutilizes the talents of Winston Duke, and there are a few too many James Cameron-esque graphic and cinematic attributes reminiscent of ""Avatar"" (2009) and ""The Abyss"" (1989)), but these are minor shortcomings in comparison to everything else the picture has to offer. Of course, it's impossible to talk about this release without noting that it probably wouldn't have the same onscreen impact were it not for the tragic offscreen story that has sadly accompanied it, though the filmmakers truly deserve praise for their sensitive handling of this matter without giving in to cheap exploitation or sensationalism, results that may very well have occurred in lesser-skilled hands. It's truly comforting to see that the ""Black Panther"" franchise has managed to weather this storm and to do so as well as it has. Wakanda Forever indeed."

(If you're extra nerdy, questions like ""How has nobody brought up the Book of Vishanty, Eternity, the Egyptian gods, or the Eternals earlier?"", ""Why didn't any one of said entities help fight Thanos?"", and the classic ""So where are the Avengers right now?"" have been more nagging than ever.) That's a problem too, certainly, but it's not the one I'm talking about today.Instead, it's a problem best illustrated by the way people responded to the trailer for Phase Four's finale, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever: ""Holy sh-t! This one actually looks like a movie!""Indeed, most of the other Phase Four media feels like the same thing: commercial sludge made in a cold, soulless factory to meet a Disney+ content quota before a set date (yes, even the theatrical releases had this feel to them), where the most interesting artistry and personality come in the form of Raimi's weird editing in Multiverse of Madness or Waititi being more unfunny than ever with Thor: Love and Thunder. Meanwhile, Wakanda Forever seemed to have acting, framing, music, and special effects that felt genuinely cinematic.In no world should ""it feels like a movie"" constitute a remarkable point of praise for a film. Alas, we live in a world of Thor: Love and Thunder and Ant-Man: Quantumania (the preview for which is the most ""Spy Kids"" that the MCU has looked yet, on top of displaying some truly clunky compositions) so what can ya do?There are some aspects of Wakanda Forever that look thrown together (don't get me started on the CGI for ""Not Atlantis"" in some shots, or a certain costume that I'll get to later), but it never looks like an ad for Bluetooth speakers the way that Love and Thunder often did (sometimes literally). By the start, it also seems to opt for a relatively small and personal story -- largely concerned with Shuri (Letitia Wright), Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o), Queen Ramonda (Angela Bassett), and the other Wakandans processing the passing of King T'Challa and the implications of Wakanda unveiling itself to the world -- instead of going on another multidimensional roller-coaster ride where ""all life"" is at stake (on Earth or in the totality of existence) that goes so over-the-top that it becomes boring.Sadly, what we ultimately end up with is still very much a post-Endgame MCU movie: There ""need"" to be cameos and subplots. There ""need"" to be references to The Blip. There ""needs"" to be a globe-trotting quest involving special new items and superheroes. There ""needs"" to be a set-up for a future TV show starring Dominique Thorne's new Ironheart character -- whose costume is so laughable that it took me a good minute to realize that the promo pic circulating online was from the actual film and not the Asylum knock-off. As Robert Daniels wrote in his review, the transition from T'Challa's funeral to the Marvel logo is a sign of things to come.Sure, we don't get unnecessary post-credits teases for Doctor Doom or Galactus or whatever, but one still gets the impression that Ryan Coogler didn't have the same freedom with this one. Black Panther was relatively self-contained and, in a way, ""deeper"" than many other MCU titles; I once dismissed it as merely being ""good for a Marvel film"" (which still rings true on the level of art direction, acting, and such) but appreciate it more in retrospect. As YouTube essayist F. D. Signifier argues in a highly interesting video, it did something new for the way black characters (and the dualisms/conflicts of the ""black psyche""), as well as the African continent, are depicted in media -- namely media of this size, reach, and success. Hollywood product or not, there's a reason its Afrofuturism and themes resonated with viewers in a way that transcended fandoms.I was hoping that Wakanda Forever would similarly set itself apart from Phase Four. Truth is, the Phase has ended on a jumbled note; a tug-of-war between a universe-building studio and a movie-maker who wants to do something halfway serious --not the least of which is paying tribute to the late Chadwick Boseman.Fans have argued enough about what the best option would be vis-à-vis Boseman's passing: Would it have been tasteless to simply recast him, or is it worse to ""milk"" his real-world death -- to ""monetize his corpse"", as one critic put it -- by killing T'Challa off-screen and turning his demise into a crucial plot element? I'm not sure where I stand on the killing-off vs recasting of T'Challa as such, but wish to note that we likely wouldn't be asking that question if this wasn't ultimately a comic book product (designed to sell toys and future adventures) and just a genuine, personal, and untarnished piece of art by Ryan Coogler. Something tells me it was gonna feel weird one way or the other.Maybe it's not my place to say, partly because I can't possibly know how Boseman would've felt about this being the format his eulogy took, but also because, hey, I'm not a part of the ""true"" intended audience here:As someone pointed out on TikTok, what's really important is that we let PoC viewers ""have"" this movie, enjoy it in peace, and be the ones to speak on what is or isn't appropriate. I straight-up saw someone ask that white folks don't even go see this film in a theater on premiere night. Out of respect for this supplication, I watched Wakanda Forever on a pirated CAMRip and so got a double whammy by not having to give Disney any money. You're welcome, guys!"

My main problem is having an actress physically ill suited to the role. Don't care if she's eaten the herbs or wears the powered suit she looks anorexic to the point of looking skeletal. That's not an appealing look for a superhero. The movie is too long and has little action though the three action set pieces are well done and the director uses slow motion to great effects. The movie's main strength is its villain Namor ( though I know they changed his origin completely ). The actor did a good job and the origin presented here was unique and interesting. As always the special effects are top notch. Marvel has done a great job with its casting and getting the actors physically fit for their roles but here with the main protagonist they failed miserably and I have to say the Wakandan's forever superior attitudes were so annoying that I was half rooting for the Talokans.

A lot of projects that affect a lot of heroes, the lack of a clear narrative line, which the previous three phases of the franchise were famous for, just a huge number of second-rate and uninteresting heroes and an impressive number of inconsistencies - all this is imputed to the creators, led by the chief executive Kevin Feige from a loving and not very viewer. And against this background, the last film of the phase comes out, which should translate the Cinematic Universe into a new fifth. The name of the project is ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"".Frankly speaking, I was impressed with the trailer, hoping that the epic shown in it would move into the picture itself. And I wasn't disappointed. The scale of the film is present. There are a lot of beautiful scenes and locations in the picture. However, with all the danger indicated, which threatens a huge war between many countries, the film feels like it remains somehow local or something. Despite the potential conflict between continents and the ocean, I never managed to feel all the power that other projects with a large number of superheroes possessed.The visual component turned out to be cool. The picture, as before, pleases the eye. Marvel knows how to make his worlds convincing. However, I didn't really like the implementation of the Black Panther itself. The artists obviously messed up with her. The level of graphics and detail is clearly not up to the level of a Marvel blockbuster. The very first films even then looked much more realistic in terms of painted superhero armor. On the other hand, the even more open world of high-tech Wakanda and the new underwater world is very impressive. I pay tribute to the creators. They are able to surprise with detailed fantastic equipment, weapons, smart devices, equipment of heroes. Well, the countries themselves look great on the screen. These are whole new worlds that, it seems, could well exist in reality. However, you catch yourself thinking that the further the development of the Cinematic Universe moves, the more fantastic the worlds become, already noticeably different from the real one in which we live. If the first films still tried to somehow fit into the existing laws of physics, then the latest projects hit concrete fiction, where excessive loads on the human body at high altitudes and during deep dives can no longer do much harm to a person.There are a lot of heroes in the picture. The screenwriters quite successfully intertwine their destinies, thereby subordinating their characters to the events taking place. And these events lead to a global war. However, only residents of Wakanda, a small handful of people and residents of the underwater world will have to figure it out. Although the conflict will be spectacular, it will still be perceived as something not so essential, as if sterile, existing outside the general Marvel universe.The actors cope with the tasks. I would have noted the performance of Letitia Wright, Angela Bassett and Tenoch Huerta. Their brothers-in-law, Ramonda and Namor, respectively, were good and convincing. But here the whole point, as I think, is in the script, which devotes much more time to these characters, leaving everyone else in the background. The events unfolding reveal the motivation of the main male character of the picture. Namor is quite convincing in his monologues. He has seen a lot, so he makes preventive decisions to protect his world. Shuri will have to figure out how to treat the new realities that Namor puts her in front of.Another important point of the picture is Shuri's search for herself. After the death of her brother, she does not find a place for herself, and subsequent events make her lose faith altogether. In order to get together and accept everything that is happening, she will need to go through a series of tests inside herself, where unexpected meetings are waiting for her.The new heroine, Riri Williams, who according to the comics was a follower of Iron Man Tony Stark, seems to have been introduced here simply because it had to be done at least in some project. This character turned out to be of little interest to me personally. And it didn't work out to reveal it to the viewer. There were also problems with the balance of power between the rivals. If at first the antagonists appear as something very dangerous and inflexible, then, as if overnight, then everything abruptly turns over, extolling the opponents' strength. It doesn't look very convincing, but we have to accept that in an already protracted 2.5-hour film it was necessary to somehow approach the finale.The picture and the creators say goodbye in the film to both the hero T'Challa and the 43-year-old actor Chadwick Bozeman who left us. These are essentially two goodbyes. And if the first one passes (for me personally) without emotion, then the second such farewell turns out to be in place. Actress Letitia Wright, as if for everyone, from the film crew to the ordinary viewer, fills the frame with drama, with her tears she says how everyone grieves for Bozeman who left us. Touching.""Wakanda Forever"" turned out to be a good movie. This is a controversial project in many ways, which I personally quite liked. Not a bad picture with a lot of good jokes, by the way. Marvel again successfully manages to insert humor into its projects, thereby diluting a seemingly serious scenario. The picture will find both its supporters and haters. Someone will see the notorious agenda, someone good humor, someone beautiful visual, and someone illogical scenario. An amateur painting.7 out of 10."

It mourns the loss of the main star Chadwick Boseman, of whom played T'Challa. With that, they decided to kill the character as well rather than recasting and made this sequel about his sister Shuri. That really spearheaded a real emotional story about Shuri finding her place in Wakanda. I can see why they made T'Challa die as Boseman's death was so sudden and he really nailed the role. I'm also not a big fan of recasting, more for live action and after a couple appearances of a particular character.This movie does introduce Namor. It does paint Namor more as a Mayan character. It does make it were Namor's people and the Wakandans could relate to each other more.Besides the emotional story, Wakanda Forever has brilliant visuals.

Then, we also have the grief plot tying in really well via the critical thinking between nation states being fallible with the spectre of colonization over them, driving the fear. The resolution and accountability involved was perfect too.On top of that you have another gorgeous production, fantastic acting, and wonderful colour palette. There's not that many fantastic Marvel movies. Most of them are fun, but a bit dumb. This is intelligent and and fun, a rare thing in super hero flicks.

The violent scenes were also used appropriately instead of just fighting for fighting sake which is often the case in many others.The villain wasn't super flashy or charismatic but I think he worked very well for this story. He has some unique skills and isn't a prototypical villain. It will be interesting to see how they use him in the future.The mid credit scene certainly opens up future storyline options and there's a couple different ways it could go.

The score by Ludwig Goransson was once again on-point, the realisation of Talokan was fantastic, and every reverence to Chadwick Boseman was respectful and heartbreaking in equal measure. This is a movie that really cared about the legacy of its late star, and was aware of the love and admiration he had earned. But unfortunately, also like the first movie, there was a bunch about Wakanda Forever that I wasn't as much of a fun of. It was too long, filled with too much faff, it was so badly lit certain scenes were almost unwatchable, and they put their bets on the wrong leading actor going ahead. And yet I'm eager to see the effect this movie has on the wider MCU going forward. It did lay the groundwork for a lot of upcoming projects, even if it was to the film's overall detriment. And if you ignore all of that the core elements of the film are essential viewing for any Marvel fan. Wakanda Forever somehow managed to simultaneously be one of the MCU's highest peaks, as well as one of its lowest ditches.

Director Ryan Coogler and company carry on the good work they initiated in 2018, expanding the Black Panther subverse to include Meso-American culture and ethos in the best possible way, paying rich tribute to the memory of Chadwick Boseman in the process.We rejoin Shuri (Letitia Wright) and Queen Ramonda (Angela Bassett) in the techno-futuristic African country of Wakanda as they mourn the loss of Prince T'Challa/Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) after he dies of a mysterious ailment. As the country comes to grips with the loss of their charismatic leader, new threats start to emerge from the woodworks, chief among them a winged mer-man ""Namor"" (Tenoch Huerta) who seems to represent a hidden Meso-American tribe with access to ungodly amounts of Vibranium, who doesn't seem to have peaceful co-existence on his agenda. How Wakanda handles this disruptive change to the global power structure forms the rest of the story.Tenoch Huerta is an absolute revelation as ""Namor"", a winged mutant superhero based in the depths of the ocean, a Marvel Comics creation that came much before DC Comics' ""Aquaman"", in 1939, created by writer-artist Bill Everett. Kevin Feige and the think tanks at Marvel brilliantly reconned his origin story from Greek origins based in Atlantis to Meso-American heraldry that achieved the proverbial ""hitting two birds with one stone"" bullseye. Not only does it expand the universe to represent Latin American culture and sensibilities, but it also neatly avoids comparisons with DC's Jason Momoa-led ""Aquaman"" franchise.With stunning imagery, dance and musical numbers and moving farewell and tribute sequences, ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" will be enshrined as a fitting farewell to Chadwick Boseman, who reflected everything expected of a true superhero even in his real life, by bravely fighting cancer. With the introduction of Dominque Thorne aka ""Iron Heart"" and the revelation of ""Namor"" as MCU's second mutant after ""Ms Marvel"", the film also serves up the promise of a mouth-watering upcoming Phase 5 as vaunted Phase 4 draws to a close.

I was looking forward to seeing him more in the MCU which is why his passing was heartbreaking. The sequel then had a tough choice on whether to recast T'Challa or not. Marvel Studios decided to go down the route of not recasting him which I understand but was a little disappointed by. I love the character of T'Challa and having his journey in the MCU end so prematurely was slightly saddening. Did Ryan Coogler make the right choice, or was this an unfortunate misstep?I have to say that this is indeed one of the most emotional and mature Marvel films in a long time. The choice to have T'Challa killed off is handled with the utmost respect and care within the story. Shuri is the main central character and the emotional core is about her grief with her brother's death. The story does a phenomenal job of illustrating her emotional journey which is deep and compelling. We also get to see how other characters handle the passing such as Ramonda and their way of handling grief which is different from Shuri. I appreciated that as people do indeed handle grief differently. One issue with MCU movies lately is the overabundance of comedy. Thankfully, this movie does not do that and for the most part, is a very serious movie. The beginning and ending are wonderfully done as well and are not typical of Marvel.It is clear that Chadwick's passing affected the actors as their performance is stunning. Letitia Wright gives a vastly different performance as Shuri that shows the pain and anger of her loss. Danai Gurira also delivers a great performance as Okoye and Lupita Nyong'o as Nakia respectively. Winston Duke returns as M'Baku and is still more or less the funny character but there are some great moments of serious from him that I love. Tenoch Huerta Mejía is the antagonist Namor, King of the underwater country Talokan, and I think he does a great job. He is fearsome and royal but his performance is quite charming with some heart. The biggest performance standout comes from Angela Bassett as Ramonda. Her performance is phenomenal! I am not surprised she got the best supporting actress because it is that good.On that note, I really like that Talokan does not look like Atlantis from Aquaman (2019). The design is more traditional and inspired by Mesoamerican which is a great choice. Ludwig Göransson returns to compose the soundtrack and he just continues to do a brilliant job. There is a scene where it is about exploring Talokan which sticks in my mind because of the great design and the amazing music score. In terms of action scenes, there is a pretty enjoyable car chase near the beginning that I liked.However, that is the only action scene I enjoyed. One thing this film does not do as well is the action scenes. The first issue is that there aren't a lot of action scenes and the second is that every action scene after the car chase is not entertaining. The choreography is not as well done and the final fight is just dull. The final fight is also logically baffling tactically as it felt like an incredibly silly and dumb plan. The movie just lacked a lot of triumphant moments that would make you cheer. It doesn't help that this movie is an incredibly slow burner with it taking a while for things to happen. The movie is really long at 160 minutes as well and it didn't even need to be. The movie could cut 20 minutes of its runtime and most of the core story stays the same.In terms of story, they try to incorporate the idea of other countries going for Vibranium ever since T'Challa opened Wakanda to the world. I don't think they do a good job at this as it felt distracting from the main conflict. Everett Ross (Martin Freeman) returns from the first film and Valentina (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) returns from other Marvel projects. However, their incorporation into the plot is forced and doesn't add to the main narrative. One issue I have with Phase 4 of MCU is this running theme of kids being hunted down by bad guys. It happened in Doctor Strange 2 and Hawkeye but also here in Wakanda forever with Riri Williams being hunted by Namor. It's it flame as it feels like it was done to give Riri a TV series rather than being an integral character plot-wise. I also don't think the film does a good job of showing how Talokan is a huge threat. Their tech feels minimal compared to Wakanda so it is hard to believe that Wakanda would struggle against them.Overall, Ryan Coogler handled this wonderfully. He treated the passing of Chadwick with the utmost respect, and I got to admire that. I don't think this movie is as good as the first one but it is definitely one of the more emotional ones. I'm not sure what direction Black Panther can go in now but whatever it is, I hope it retains the mature take of Wakanda Forever."

Instead, Wakanda Forever primarily served as a vehicle to introduce Namor and Talokan. The film rightfully embraced a more somber tone as it dealt with themes of loss and legacy, but the mournful spirit caused the plot to sag and drag along throughout most of the runtime. Winston Duke offers the little levity the movie had. The cast delivered exceptionally, with Angela Bassett's performance as the true standout.

So maybe a little bit of getting lost in some of the plot intricacies is on me. Some superfluous dialogue moments that didn't necessarily need to be there. Some pacing issues that could have been cleaned up just a bit.The main female cast was excellent. I loved seeing all of the recurring characters. They handled the posthumous celebration of Chadwick Boseman in a discreet and respectful manner that didn't come off as overstated or eat away too much at the film standing out on its own two legs without the support of its former lead actor.I definitely felt that it was nowhere near as good as what I remember the first one being. The main villain here, Namor (Tenoch Huerta), is not nearly as strong as Michael B. Jordan's Killmonger. That being said, it is much better than the majority of the mediocre endeavors that Marvel has put out in the post ""Endgame"" era of Phase Four.

From beginning to end I felt the heart that went through this film. There is so much love that is shown and makes the film emotional throughout. The action was very well done throughout. The acting was also quite solid. I think the one thing is that the film does somewhat drag. Some scenes I felt weren't super necessary to the plot as well. I did like Ironheart though, although she could've been left out of the film and it wouldn't have mattered, she was still cool. They do need to explain some stuff about Ironheart though. Overall I thought this was a nice, bitter sweet, action packed film that was quite good. It was by far the best thing Marvel has put out this year."

I'm not sure they had to kill T'Challa, but I do understand the difficulties of replacing the like of Chadwick Boseman who made the role his own. I'm not sure they had to present Namor the way they did, even though his character in the comics allows for this option, but it does limit what they can do with him in the future. And I don't like the fact they kill other leading characters almost as an easy way out.All that said, this wasn't a bad movie. It wasn't disjointed as other reviewers here suggested - I spoke with a few that watched the movie with me - we had no problem following the plot. It was definitely a very slow action movie - as my title says - that's a result of the decision to focus on the characters, and this is a decision I do agree with. It did present us with a lot of superb acting performances with Letitia Wright, Angela Bassett and Danai Gurira topping the list, but with almost no false note in the entire cast. And when the roles are so well performed the slow pace of the movie doesn't make it any less riveting. Again, the role of Namor does leave a lot to be desired, though they did try to give him some depth, but I think they made him a bit too contradictory and so very hard to play and relate to.Bottom line, the moment they decided to make the new Black Panther a she, they were bound to face a lot of animosity on this site. It comes with the territory over here, and I know I'm going to pay with a lot of hate, here - I'm half expecting it by now. But I liked the way they dealt with the issue of grief and international politics. And even if the role of Riri was shoved into the movie for external reasons I don't think it hurt the movie in any way."

Queen, M'Baku, Shuri, Nakia, Ross, dora milaje, and each character is so powerful to the story. Not some background characters. This is not seen in other MCU films. The first half of this film was so powerful, it really means what Chadwick means to all of the cast and crew. Loved that. Good story but was disappointed with Namor and the ending fight in ocean. Marvel visual studios need to do better. You are earning a ton load of money, invest them on people who do the work. Visuals could have been far better. The acting and also the emotional connection with that... so strong. You wouldn't believe. She shows why she is the queen mother. Angella Bassett nails this performance as an actor, mother and queen. Loved the emotions portrayed in this film. Maybe the ending should have been kept open without the last fight and continue this in next part. This should have been a superhero film about grief, with no actions fights. They serve no purpose to what they were trying to achieve. But nonetheless a wonderful goodbye to Chadwick."

I mean they did everything wrong with that aspect, without spoilers, that's the only person in the world capable of building the device really? That entire character construct is completely over the top and as the movie goes forward it seems for whatever reason the antagonist perspective which made sense up until half way through the film suddenly is ignored to become an excuse to have Black Panther vs ""main villain"" last showdown boring fight?Also, the speed in which the main character goes from understanding to a revenge machine is a complete weird change in character development its just too fast.. There are several plot developments that made no sense in the second and third acts of the movie and is filled with so much stereotypical hero movie stuff, the ""preparation to beat the villain"", the unsuspecting person without super powers that enters the fight without any previous experience yet manages to beat everyone, the ""spy/secret weapon"" that enters an ancient nation no one has ever been before without anyone blinking an eye... I can't give an higher rate no matter how good it is to see the inclusion aspect which I hope is a trend in Marvel going forward."

However Tenoch Huerta as ""Namor"" has got a balanced attitude because he's got a giant chip on each shoulder plus mutant abilities (including an Achilles heel literally).This dude can fly and breathe underwater and is one of the main reasons this North Queenslander took up diving and snorkelling as an aquatic hobby.In the past ""Namor"" has worked with the Avengers, the Fantastic Four, the X-Men and others, but they don't get a look in during this origins storyline leaving the door wide open to expand this chapter of the MCU.Just one question: What's with the water bombs?It was like a kids birthday party every time Namors people exploded one.What I liked about ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"": The wonderful minutes silence for the original ""Black Panther"" actor Chadwick Boseman who would have loved this movie no doubt.African-American Ryan Coogler returns to direct this sequel and felt right at home in the big chair again with a huge budget of hundreds of millions of greenbacks to play with.Rhianna even wrote a new hit song just for this movie, ""Lift Me Up"" plays during the closing titles.Watch out for: The costumes, sets, the pageantry, the fight scenes and the bonus revealing end credits plus a marvellous eye watering tribute to the memory of Boseman.Plus Angela Bassett delivers an academy award award winning speech and performance in her reprised role as as ""Queen Ramonda"".3.5/5*"

This movie is nominated for 5 awards, some more deserved than others in my opinion. The awards are; best supporting actress, visual effects, best original song, costume design and make-up and hairstyling.What a snore to get through. Wakanda Forever feels like one of the most forgettable movies I´ve seen in a while with what feels like no heart or soul put into it. I´ll give them one thing: it´s hard moving on when tragedy strikes. I think none of us expected Chadwick Boseman to lose his life so soon, and it can sadly throw off a lot of industry work and planning. Of course, respect, human life and mourning comes first, and this movie handles that aspect with some respect but clearly then had to fill out the rest of it´s runtime with mediocre things. Boseman will be missed. Also why is there two movies in the Oscars this year with blue people living underwater?In the wake of T´Challas passing. Everyone is mourning and the new leader of Wakanda is crowned. The rest of the world is looking to obtain vibrainium and they are finding sources outside of Wakanda. It´s guarded by a tribe of people, now going to war with the surface world. It´s up to Shuri to make peace in Wakanda again.The CGI is not great here. Some aspects look fine like cities and underwater stuff but some of the models to later robots look so bad. It was so obvious it was fake. The villain also moves in a very unnatural way. I don't know if they had him on wires, but he looked very wired in post.The editing is fine until the last half of the movie. It has to cut between different battle scenarios, and it does this in a very unsatisfying and jarring way. The final battle is really hard to follow. The action within the scenes are fine but my eyes could simply not follow what was going on. The funniest thing that happened was something that annoyed my eyes and then I noticed it. It thought something looked weird in the final battle and it´s because the aspect ratio is changing. It looks so unnatural, and the movie does not pull something like that off. It comes of as pretentious and too much. The color grading for the final fight also looks laudably cheap, like a fan film. The final fight of this movie is in general a big mess.There is a lot of songs used for this movie and at the end it felt extremely obnoxious. It came of as a beg for being nominated for best original song, just one of the 4 songs. While the songs are good and fits the movie, I would rather just have the incredible score. The songs really take over towards the end and to me, it really just came off as too much.The score in this movie is the best part of it. It sounds so unique and experimental. It feels like the movie has its own identity all of a sudden and the use of instruments not often heard is so good. I really loved this score to bits and vibed throughout the entire movie.The idea for the plot is fine, but it comes of as very uneventful, boring, and even a bit pointless. The entire conflict of this movie fells very stupid. It feels like a problem that doesn't need to be there and the villain and heroes' reasons to not solve the conflict and their ways of solving the conflict seem dumb and without reason.There are not really any characters that stand out to me. The two new main characters in this movie has no personality at all. Shuri fells like a really empty character and nothing like her prior incarnation. The new added girl character also really ads nothing but conflict and an empty performance. The acting overall is fine but nothing that I found noteworthy.The action seemed really mind numbing and without many stakes, highs, and lows. I felt very passive watching it and like no one was in real danger. In general, I felt very passive and like I tuned out of this movie. It felt like just flashing colors on the screen and I never really connected to the story at any time. While there was fun to be had and interesting things to see, it overall left me feeling nothing.I could not take the villain serious in this movie. They try to make him serious and cool, and his performance is good, but his design and powers made me laugh every time. It´s hard to translate a goofy character like this well, and to me they did not sell him to me.The costume design is so good here. Every character feels and looks distinct, and it carries over the tradition from its predecessor. It´s well detailed and amazing looking costumes.This could easily had been an incredible movie. It was all down to focus and even an obvious one right in front of you. This could have been a movie about mourning and finding your identity. It could have been a movie about traditions against innovations, but this movie plays it so safe it won't allow you to feel. The aspects mentioned are in the movie but on such a surface level it ends up meaning nothing.Now I was so afraid on how they would handle Boseman´s passing and every time the movie was about to do something that could have been a respectless disaster to me, I cringed in fear. Luckily the movie plays this safe, UNTIL THE AFTERCREDITS. You might not have taken offense to what happened, and I understand that but to me, it was incredibly cringe and me and my girlfriend sat in disbelieve.This was a movie I sat through not really registering what was being presented. It was boring and uninteresting and without any form of substance. I just tuned out and was never really moved or engaged throughout the entire runtime.Oscar predictions: So this movie is nominated in 5 categories and let´s take them one at a time. It can take costume design for me, but I think it has some tough competition from movies like Babylon and Elvis. I don´t want it to take makeup and hairstyling as I think 3 movies nominated in this category displays the use of prosthetics and makeup better, and The Whale and Batman is probably in the forefront there. Original song is very tough this year and I don´t know if Rihanna can take it over Gaga, the song was also fine, nothing too special. If Wakanda Forever wins best visual effects I would laugh, and it´s going to lose to Avatar. And my hottest take, I don´t see Angela Bassetts performance as anything special. It´s good, don't get me wrong but nothing that really touched me. Two speeches were good, and the rest was just there. I personally think Dania Gurira as Okoye did a better job in this movie. I know Bassett is in the lead right now, but I would rather have Stephanie Hsu win for Everything Everywhere all at Once for what I´ve seen of the nominated supporting actresses and I could imagen I would want either Hong Chau or Kerry Condon to win when I see their performances in the Whale and Banshees respectively."

Why did I even watch this? There's just too much hope with new superhero movies. Infinity War and Endgame were great. Nolan's Batman films are superb. Every superhero movie comes with that tiny glimmer of a hope that maybe it's good or even great.Superheroes are an exciting concept and the MCU has tonnes of potential at this point in terms of budget, cross-overs (and the multiverse), source material, good actors, etc. But Wakanda Forever is an offensive waste of all that. And I mean offensive.If the movie was about a European country, could you imagine them lecturing the rest of the world about being the most powerful, wisest and most disciplined? This movie represents black supremacy. It makes itself about race and it asserts that black people are the best people. It's not about intelligence, principles, laws, communication, etc. The message is far simpler. The US is bad. White people are bad. Wakanda is good because it has no white people.Nobody would accept the reverse. But the despicable racism promoted by this movie gets ignored. It's also laughable in the face of reality where Africa is hardly known as a continent full of tolerance, prosperity, responsibility, etc.The plot itself is convoluted. The Talokan are interesting but only in their surface details - how they look and sound, not so much what they say or do. They get less interesting the more we learn. At times I wished I was watching Aquaman which I didn't even like that much - at least it was fun at times.The acting by the main two actresses is barely watchable. So forced, so superficial. There is no subtlety or depth. The humour falls flat. I couldn't believe some of the jokes. There's a reference to ""the white girl from Indiana Jones"". Why mention her skin colour? It doesn't help indicate who they mean and it isn't funny. I can't stand people obsessed with race rather than actual human qualities.The CGI is mixed. Sometimes kinda cool but most of it looks completely fake. The physics are terrible and really take you out of the movie. Too many sudden changes in speed, inconsistent momentum/impact, no gravity, etc. It's arbitrary who dies or gets injured as well.The dedication to Chadwick Boseman is touching. It is truly said that he died so young and the movie pays tribute to him. I just wish the movie could have been better to do his legacy justice. I also didn't really like what they did with his character. It just felt empty compared to the alternatives available.Why just a 1 out of 10? Surely some parts of the movie are entertaining? Maybe a little bit. But nowhere near enough to forgive the huge flaws. I don't like the characters, especially the main two. I don't like the message or tone of the movie at all. I found the action confusing and boring. And of course the women are on the front lines, which is completely standard.I'm Aussie but the US has clearly been a beacon of freedom in terms of long term history. To arbitrarily imply that the fictional country Wakanda is superior in technology AND morality is offensive. Why slap people who value history and freedom in the face and expect them to like your pathetic movie? It adds nothing to the MCU, just resentment and appropriation of all kinds of moments and tropes done better elsewhere."

There's a lot to unpack. And emotions need to stabilize before delving any deeper.A more emotional film than an action one.

What even was this?First of all, this movie focused way too much on the loss of the late great Chadwick Boseman and instead of just using a short time on that and the rest on the plot, they instead focused mostly on Chadwick and very little on plot. It's truly a shame. But i'm not even that mad, since I did expect this little from this awful sequel.On top of that, it was very unnecessarily long. I felt like I wasted 2 hours and 46 minutes of my life which i'll never get back. Everything after Endgame sucks, and this is by far no exception.

I wanted to truly give this film a chance. A complete unaffected, unbiased opinion so that I maybe open minded to whatever they do in this sequel. To further emphasize on how much I wanted to give this film it's honest chance I was even willing to put on blinders to the trash Disney/Marvel has produced in recent months.With all that said Wakanda Forever is a solid sequel and entry into the MCU. This film had a lot of great moments that made me very happy. The acting was great, the cinematography was beautiful, the cgi while at times weak was mostly well done definitely better than recent Disney/Marvel productions looking at you She Hulk. The score was great, I loved when they incorporated some music from the first film with some of the new. Making things better it's pretty apparent Disney stayed out of the way and kept their crap agenda mostly out.Before going further I must mention while Chadwick Boseman's absence is apparent his spirit is in this film. They pay tremendous homages to T'Challa. But what I appreciated the most about this film was how different it felt, not your standard superhero affair. They chose to put a lot of focus on how Wakanda and these characters are affected without King T'Chala. They also spent a lot of time developing the character who would pick up the mantle of Black Panther, and the ending I think honored T'Challa very well. Although while I enjoyed this aspect of the film I think it may not sit well with audience members seeking said standard superhero affair. Especially with the consideration Black Panther is only in this film for like 30 or 20 minutes.But with all this good there is still a rain cloud, the story while interesting didn't really captivate me for the entire runtime. Which will lead me to my next issue, this film is unnecessarily long at 2 hours and 41 minutes and due to minor pacing issues it felt closer to 3 hours. Then of course the cgi, as I said before it does hold up for the most part but there are multiple scenes where the background is obviously cgi causing the immersion to be broken. Normally it wouldn't be such a big deal to me but with the amount of money Disney puts in these films and even how the last Black Panther had better cgi in this regard there's no excuse.Overall while I did enjoy this film and it's clear that Ryan Coogler and company set out to make a worthy sequel that would honor Chadwick Boseman's legacy it unfortunately just doesn't quite live up to it's predecessor. The final score is one I struggled to come to because as much as I wanted to push it to an 8 it's those issues that bogged things down for me.IMDb: 7/10

Her character is handled in a similar way that America Chavez is in Doctor Strange in The Multiverse of Madness, in that she is a teenager with a unique set of skills whose primary aim is being a driving plot device. But while I found America sympathetic and likeable, Riri came off slightly annoying and underdeveloped. I'm unsure if I'm going to watch her upcoming series Ironheart.Phase 4 has been so-so.

It was hard to balance an emotional story of farewell to that character with an absurd one of fish-people being angry with Wakanda. This leads me to my biggest problem with the portrayal of Wakanda, and the fish people in the MCU. Vibranium is supposed to give both countries this amazing technological advantage over the rest of the world to the extent that major powers like the US are afraid of Wakanda, and yet when they actually do fight-their warriors line up in ranks like it's 1435. Where are the tanks? The heavy guns? The missiles? They do have jet like things. It just seems like strategically, if the Wakandans every did go to war with a country like the US, it would be a massacre. And the fish people are even worse. They have no advanced technology whatsoever. And yet they are able to catch Wakanda by surprise. While it was an enjoyable watch, it was too long."

And threatens Wakanda on a brink of war. But my thoughts are who will be the next Black Panther? 2 hours and a half, we are introduced to the new Black Panther. It was great seeing the other side of the new side characters along with Namor's world underwater. But it's a bit annoying to wait for the new Black Panther to get screen time.

It's long (2:45) and it does have a couple of sub-plots that don't do much except use up screen time (see below), but there's lots here that's really good. Most of all, this one is showing definite signs that the MCU is maturing into handling serious stuff in a way that is getting closer to mainstream, good movies. The pace is relaxed, the obligatory action sequences don't go on endlessly, and there is actual dialog and characterization that are given enough time to breathe.In other words, maybe the MCU is growing up. I think there were already good signs that this was coming in Shang-Chi (2021) and in Spider-Man No Way Home (2021), to be fair. These movies and Wakanda Forever have a richness of texture and a deliberate pace that I really liked.Probably the reasons for this are clear enough. Their main Black Panther star, Chadwick Boseman, sadly is now gone, so they had to decide how to work around it. As we see on screen, they confronted it head-on: T'Challa is said to have died of an unspecified illness and now the rest of the kingdom has to move on. For the storyline, this turns out to free up a whole lot of space for the other main characters (Shuri, Nakia, Okoye, Raimonda, M'Baku) to work, and they do a great job. It's like we're meeting them for the first time. They were all there in the first Black Panther, but of course they were all playing second fiddle for the Big Guy.Which leads me to say that because of all this, Wakanda Forever is now just the second (or maybe third at a stretch) female-led MCU movie! (and Black women at that). To some extent it's an ensemble piece, but ultimately this is Letitia Wright's movie to make or break, and as Shuri she continues to be excellent.The side plot with agent Ross (Martin Freeman) was sort of a fun distraction but seemed to be entirely disposable, frankly. Same for the young Riri Williams (Dominque Thorne), who seems to be brought in just to fill in the blank of ""which new character shall we introduce this time?"" But it was an interesting choice to make the main 'villains', Namor and his people (he's actually one of the very oldest Marvel comics characters), into Mayan-ancestry figures, and I guess it works about as well as any other option. True to form, all MCU antagonists are given extensive backstories, and Namor is important enough to get an even bigger than average treatment. Still, the pairing of Wakanda and the submarine Talokan is really an odd one. In places it just doesn't quite work.Enough. If you haven't seen it, ignore the reviews that say it's 'slow' or 'too dialogy' and go take it in. Maybe Marvel really is moving on from Avengers-style wall-to-wall action."

One super technically evolved race of almost super humans going up against another civilization of even More powerful beings! Thats gonna make for some mindblowing conflict on a huge scale...As far as the new Black Panther?I have to say that I would have preferred
that it be played by a male only because of the physicality of the role. While a female in this case is Enhanced far beyond her own limitations to levels of great strength, it just seemed less believeable especially in the fight scenes
requiring her to go up against, not just men, but superhuman men...That said, the actress does an excellent job ...Gender swapping of established roles seems to be the Thing these days and here ,its no exception..How anyone would not be thoroughly entertained and frankly, blown away by this movie is beyond me...It stands head and shoulders above most of the super hero movies from DC and Marvel that have come out recently..This one is a keeper for me and thats rare these days..Its one of my all time favorites that I look forward to watching again.

In the end, it does a pretty admirable job, all things considered. It cannot live up to the original's achievement but still does a creditable follow-up. But the film combines a sensitive approach to mourning with the presence of mind of governing a nation in times of crisis.While mourning the loss of her brother T'Challa, Princess Shuri faces the direct challenge from the Talokan, an aggressive underwater tribe with formidable powers, as it starts to wage war against the western nations and then prepares for aggression against Wakanda itself. What follows is a cross-fire of international tensions and imperiled alliances. A delicate truce between Wakanda and the rest of the world is sorely tested. Leticia Wright is superb as the film's center of gravity. Tenoch Huerta makes an impression as a menacing but also funny antagonist, as king of the underwater rogue nation. Angela Bassett is a commanding presence as the Sovereign Queen Mother. Lupita Nyong'o and Winston Duke are given meager screentime, but both still make their presence felt with smallish roles. Dominique Thorne is down to earth and likeable as the brilliant MIT student whose craft falls into the wrong hands. Julia Louis-Dreyfus has an amusingly glib turn as the new CIA director.Although this film probably could have shed some of its running time, in the end, it makes for an engaging Marvel experience. A tighter film probably would have spent less time in the science lab but the more deliberate pace can be forgiven because the climax is so intense and well-executed. A globetrotting epic fight for world domination in the sea and on land never felt so brisk and sunny. Recommended to those looking for a wild adventure."

Winston Duke also successfully delivered a few moments here and there.Riri Williams, who was also badly cast to boot, on the other hand, and her suit that felt like it just walked out of the Spy Kids franchise, did more harm than good to the movie, while Namor was an uncompelling portrayal of the anti-villain, the new Black Panther is an unconvincing one, the finale sequence was reminiscent of Iron Man the movie and character in several ways, but not nearly as good or exciting, the story and action were unsatisfying, and, the twist was good, but at a practical level, rather than an impactful one.Understandably, yes, the movie was presented with an uphill battle after the tragedy of Chad, but, with what Phase 4 has been, it is difficult to tell if this movie ended up being this that it was, due to circumstances, or Marvel Studios' new self-sabotage approach. Either way, Wakanda Forever didn't quite manage to achieve saving this phase, but it did help it perhaps, to save face, though barely, as the damage has already been done.6.5/10."

With the huge shoes that need to be filled in mind, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever really did do a great job. It still suffers from Marvel formulitis and the new trend of over explaining character motivations (i.e. Flash backs during the final standoff) which do cripple it a fair bit. Ultimately, it does the seemingly impossible of taking the tragic loss of Chadwick Boseman and building a compelling story around it without ever seeming like the movie exists to make a quick buck off of his passing.I feel like a broken record and even slightly mysoginistic whenever I say this, but I feel like it must be pointed out whenever possible: This is female empowerment done right. The lead actresses are fantastic and the characters they play are strong on their own terms without having to condescend constantly to men to prove their superiority. So many ""empowerment"" moments or whole films today focus soley on showing how the female protagonist is better than the guys, rather than just showing that she is awesome in general."

Wakanda Forever however stands way above the rest of Phase 4 and I'm really happy that Phase 4 ended this way. This film is an improvement over the first film in my opinion in almost every aspect. The visual effects while still off look better than the PS2 effects of the first movie. The characters here are all very well written and incredibly well acted. Angela Bassett gives probably one of the best performances in the entire series here and Letitia Wright does an amazing job as well. Wright probably has one of the best character arcs in the MCU as well. Watching her learn to process her grief over the death of her brother is heartbreaking. Her arc feels a lot more personal as does most of the rest of this film. To address the obvious, Chadwick Boseman's presence here is sorely missed but the film does an absolutly beautiful job at handling this. The film not really respects the character of T'Challa but also Chadwick as well. The first 10 minutes and last 5 address his departure and those last 5 minutes caused me to start crying. Tenoch Huerta does a great job as well and plays a great antagonist here although I do prefer Killmonger. Namor has an understandable motivation of protecting his people from being found on although he goes about it through the wrong way of attacking Wakanda. I struggle to call Namor a villain nor an anti-hero because of his motivation and his intentions to try and make peace at first. Ryan Coogler once again proves that he is easily one of the best directors in the MCU and the film just looks absolutely gorgeous. Easily one of the best looking films in the MCU and one of the best sounding. Ludwig Göransson's score is once again great although the music from the first film is just a little bit better. I did have some minor issues with the film though. I already mentioned the visual effects but the pacing here is definitely off. The first act (minus the first 10 minutes) speeds through everything before finally slowing down and the humor when it is used only works about 50% of the time although I do really like that this film MAJORLY cuts back on the typical MCU comedy. This is very easily one of the best entries in the MCU and I would definitely recommend watching this when you get the chance."

Without his presence, this film feels like it is missing something distinctive and important. Losing Chadwick makes the film have a different storyline, but still stick to the previous principles. Wakanda Forever comes with a dark story in celebrating the disappearance of Black Panther and their king. The early part of the film shows a deep emotional side to give the last funeral of the King. Later, the film is brought to the story of sadness that is still attached to Ramonda and Shuri. Only then did conflict come with the existence of the sea world which then attacked Wakanda. Namor and Wakanda become a new story that complicates the situation and conditions of Wakanda.Wakanda Forever is a sequel that too much to tell and deliver. For almost three hours, the film brings a lot of sad stories and new introductions that are less solid and neat to tell. The film's already good and interesting opening pays homage to T'Challa, immediately slamming to accept the fact that in the next scene the film is disoriented. Wakanda Forever tries to tell a new story of Wakanda's life after T'Challa's legacy. However, the presentation of the story is not right so that it makes the entire film less neat. The movement of each scene that seemed to me to be too fast even less flowed, as if moving one scene to another that was too focused and on the point. Emphasized by the unsatisfactory completion of the film and felt capable of more than just a scientific battle.Wakanda Forever still presents a series of eye-catching visuals in it, from T'Challa's funeral ceremony to the depiction of the underworld and the beautiful kingdom of Namor through small details in it. The beauty of Namor's costume and his underwater kingdom deserves to be appreciated. Likewise, Queen Ramonda's appearance is quite good with large portions. Also Tenoch Huerta's performance as Namor who looks cool and impressive. One thing that was less interesting to me was Shuri's selection as Black Panther which was not satisfied and for me was not quite right.

I adored this film, not just for how well it honours and continues the legacy of the great Chadwick Boseman, but also how it truly felt like a natural progression from the first film. Ryan Coogler really had his work cut out for him with this film, and frankly was put in quite the impossible situation with the passing of Boseman. I am blown away at how skillfully he overcame these challenges and pivoted the story to a place that is obviously different from what we would all expect coming out of the first ""Black Panther"", and yet feels like a very natural and logical next step at the same time. Not only that, but this also feels like a return to form for the MCU after so long; this is the type of Marvel movie I fell in love with. Don't get me wrong, I have still liked (and in some cases, loved) most of Phase 4, but this film is easily the best Marvel has been since ""Endgame"". While my personal favourite of phase 4 still remains ""No Way Home"", this is a very close second to that. Films like ""Endgame"" and ""No Way Home"" were absolute triumphs, but Wakanda Forever is MCU's most beautiful, meaningful and soulful movie. It is on the level of the first ""Black Panther"" for me, and while it may not be as culturally significant, it only enhances my enjoyment and appreciation of that first film.This movie is an extremely moving and impactful experience. As I said, it is a film about grief and coming to terms with loss, even partially dealing with themes of faith. The movie is really about Shuri's emotional journey of coming to terms with the loss of T'Challa and I found that the focus on grief through the eyes of Shuri was portrayed beautifully. The denial, the anger, and finally the acceptance, was a powerful emotional journey that was needed not only by the characters of the film, but also the audience as well. It is a very emotional watch right from the opening scene. As soon as the film began it caught me off guard with the wave of emotions it made me feel, I definitely cried multiple times throughout this movie. And so did the rest of the audience. People always talk about the memorable theatre moments in these Marvel movies where people clap and cheer. But there were two bookends of absolute, respectful, beautiful silence during this movie that will always define my memory of seeing this for the first time. This silence was unlike anything I have ever witnessed in a theatre, and it really speaks to the powerful way that the film dealt with the loss of Chadwick and T'Challa. The tribute it pays to Chadwick is wonderful and made me feel a lot, but luckily that isn't where the emotions stop. The whole film is emotionally rich, with some tragic undertones throughout the film, so prepare yourself! I love films like this that tell a good story and really make you feel the emotion of it all, it speaks to how well the film works and connects with its audience.""Wakanda Forever"" is easily the best directed and most emotionally rich film in the MCU, possibly even the most cinematic film in the MCU. In terms of directorial voice and style, this is easily the most tactile, soulful, and well-crafted MCU movie since ""Black Panther"". From the costumes to the score, everything is stunningly well crafted, and it handles its themes and tribute to Chadwick flawlessly. One of the things I appreciated most about it was that despite the movies (and tragedies) in between, it does feel like a direct continuation of Coogler's first ""Black Panther"" movie and the characters, themes, and aesthetics he developed in it. It still feels insular. Despite all the real life complications and a plot filled with new characters and world building, it still feels cohesive. The movie feels like it was written and directed by a storyteller not a committee. There are a few issues with the script, it can be clunky at times and there are points that you can tell it was hastily re-written, albeit re-written with love. This isn't Coogler's fault, the tragedy of Chadwick's passing really complicated this movie's production, and Coogler being able to pull off the pivot he did is nothing short of a miracle. So really, a few script issues aside, this film is masterful.Story-wise I loved so many of the choices Coogler made, from the way he weaved in history and politics in relation to Wakanda and its resources on a global stage, to the handling of the Black Panther, to the introduction of Namor and Talokan. I loved the way he mirrored T'Challa's arc in ""Civil War"" for Shuri here, it felt very poetic. She has one of the best emotional character arcs in the MCU in this film! The continuation of Shuri's journey felt very natural, I loved what he did with Queen Ramonda, the return of Nakia is very gratifying, and even the return of Martin Freeman's Everett Ross gave this a strong continuity with the first film and within the MCU. The newer elements, like Riri Williams and Namor, both of which I loved, are also added in a way that feels very organic. I was afraid that much of the movie would feel like Phase 5 pandering and inserted green screen reshoots with cameos, but thank god, the whole thing feels like a singular vision. This is a Ryan Coogler movie through and through! Namor especially stole the show for me, the depiction of Namor is so excellent it hurts. The movie treats him like a mythic icon and a terrifying foe, making me really wish ""Love and Thunder"" did more of this with Gorr. I loved how Coogler established Talokan and Namor's backstory, it was richly written and even sublimely tackled the effects of colonialism we still see in the world today. The movie truly nailed Namor's introduction, his arc is clear, his motivations are clear and most importantly understandable and he has instantly become one of the best MCU villains to date.I think it's probably completely natural for ""Wakanda Forever"" to hit people differently. The movie deserves a lot of credit for executing a great cinematic experience, and what is most important is that it is sure of itself, and feels so carefully crafted to accomplish what it wants to. As much as I want to see Coogler working outside the MCU, I really hope he makes one more ""Black Panther"" movie to round out the trilogy. These two films flow like a singular vision made with passion and care. I'd love to see a conclusive third film from Coogler and his team!The technical side of this film is complete perfection, and when it comes back to it this movie is likely one of the best from a technical filmmaking standpoint in the MCU, much like the first one also was. First off, what really struck me was the incredible costume design from Ruth Carter. She did a wonderful job with the Afro-futuristic styles in the first film to establish the world of Wakanda, and brings them back in fresh but familiar ways here! For ""Wakanda Forever"" she wonderfully borrowed styles from Meso-American cultures to help create the world of Talokan. The production design by Hannah Beachler was also really well done in fleshing out these worlds, I really have to say some of the strongest features about the two ""Black Panther"" films are this artistry on display in terms of costumes, sets, hair, makeup, and everything else that really makes the world of Wakanda feel so much more tangible. The movie looks and sounds great. There's a grandeur to the imagery matched with intimacy behind the camera that makes it feel so real and raw. Coogler upped his game significantly in the visuals and it's amazing what happens when they give VFX a proper timetable, because for the most part the CGI looks great! And I loved the look of the action scenes, especially Namor's attack on Wakanda as well as the 3rd act climax, which I thought really felt like it tread some new ground for Marvel! It has big CGI action, but also some great story beats and character moments to it!What was my favourite aspect of the movie though? Of course it has to be Ludwig Goransson's score! He brought back old themes, created new ones, and once again proves he is one of the most interesting composers today! I loved the musical continuity between this and the first film, it is likely the best example of it in the MCU, and I would even say these two films have the best musical scores in the MCU save for maybe the ""Avengers"" films. The sound mix was incredible and I loved the creative ways Ludwig was able to use his music in the film; it really took my breath away! Also while on the topic of sound, I thought the way they handled subtitles was quite clever! The film has lots of languages and the fact that they use different fonts and colours to distinguish them (and some moments use the difference between languages as a dramatic beat) is something that I just find really neat and cool!Continuing my praise of this film, the acting on display is pitch perfect, and really elevates everything off of the pages of the script! Tenoch Huerta was flawless as Namor, he embodied the character perfectly and especially since this is one of his first major Hollywood films, proves he has the capability to be a great talent in the industry going forward. Letitia Wright was asked to do a lot more in this film over her role in the first, taking on the leading role, and she actually gave a brilliant performance. I was so impressed with the emotions on display, as well as her ability to get the audience to back her character! She really proved she can be a leading actress, especially impressive after being thrown into it so quickly! Lupita Nyong'o and Winston Duke were both fantastic also, but I just wish they had more to do, and Dominique Thorne was instantly likable as Riri Williams! The true standout of the movie for me, however, was of course Angela Bassett as Queen Ramonda. She commanded the screen in all of her scenes, showcasing waves of emotion in her powerful performance."

The franchise obligations end up muddling the sincerity of what Ryan Coogler is artfully saying.The unexpected passing of T'Challa leaves Wakanda vulnerable as other nations are pressuring them to share vibranium. As Wakanda mourns, Queen Ramonda, Shuri, and Nakia fight to protect their nation at the arrival of the Talokan, an ancient Mayan underwater nation, led by Namor.""Everybody mourns in their own way"" was a recurring thought I had throughout Wakanda Forever. This film was how the Marvel producers chose to mourn Chadwick Boseman's passing.There's magic in Ryan Coogler's films that has the audience always rooting for his protagonists. Whether it is Creed or Black Panther, Coogler viscerally pulls you into his heroes as the underdog in every frame, and the whole world is against them. For this reason, out of the solo Marvel movies, the Black Panther movies are consistently the most emotional to sit through. Coogler earnestly carries the themes of grief and loss from beginning to end, giving a solid emotional through line that anchors the film.With her towering air of regality, Angela Bassett commands the screen and carries the film on her shoulders. When the first X-Men film was announced in the 90s, the first fan casting I made in my head was Angela Bassett as Storm. It's easy to picture her god-like, possessed, and summoning lightning from the sky. Bassett naturally carries power and that is on full display as Queen Ramonda.When it came time for Letitia Wright's Shuri to carry the film, she came up short of matching Angela Bassett's dramatic weight. It's not for lack of trying as Wright gives a good performance. I can't put my finger on whether it's the lack of pathos or Letitia Wright herself or the fact that there's an undeniable vacuum at the film's center, but the Shuri character works better as a supporting character.Tenoch Huerta Mejía's Namor was an intriguing antagonist that deserved more time devoted to development. Danai Gurira's Okoye is short-changed from having to wear an unfortunate costume.I didn't care for the Ironheart stuff. There's a kid character that is in line to replace every major Marvel hero now, most likely for building a future Avengers roster. I suspect I'll stop caring the day that transition happens.Admittedly, I was for Marvel recasting the Black Panther role. A person's life is infinitely more than the part they play in a superhero movie. The power was in the producers' hands and despite how unfathomable they say it was, they could have recast and instrumentally make it less of a deal. Even Chadwick Boseman's brother reportedly said Chadwick would have wanted T'Challa's story to continue.I can't help but imagine an alternate universe where Kevin Feige recasted the T'Challa part and the Black Panther story went to new places and perhaps an emotional silent title card for Chadwick Boseman in the credits.In a film predominantly occupied with mourning its lead actor, setting up an upcoming TV show on DisneyPlus just undercuts the sincerity of its tribute. It's such an odd way to mourn someone's memory. But that's just me.The heart of the film, or the eulogy, is all in the soundtrack, featuring Rihanna, Nigerian singer Tems, Fireboy DML, and many other African musical artists. The African-themed playlist is a dynamic, soulful search for meaning after loss. Some songs are crying, some are mourning, and other tracks are celebrations of life.The soundtrack made me want to dance; something I do not ever do. In my theater, two kids got up in the aisle and danced over the end credits-better them than me."

I loved that they didn't just chuck T'challa to the side and just move on with the storyline. I loved that the movie actually had a storyline instead of constant fighting which is something that marvel movies tend to have too much off and neglect fleshing out the story in favour of blowing things up. Loved the dialogue, witty but not overdone. Also unlike the other marvel movies I actually empathised with the villain. Yes he was a bit extreme but do you blame his fear especially considering the history of his people and when he noticed the rest of the world trying to get their paws in Wakanda's honey after T'challa and his dad went public with their nation . Obviously the movie has to have a villain but initially I was rooting for the guy. The chemistry between him and Shuri was palpable.

This might come across as quirky, if a few characters were so inclined. But when it's most of them, it becomes annoying. It's a shame. Wakanda is an interesting concept, and when first introduced into the MCU the place made sense and worked. But when introduced, it was as a super secret lair where the inhabitants avoided involvement in the outside world. It was hidden. Now there are characters jumping in and out of Wakanda. Everyone knows about Wakanda. They've somehow accelerated Wakanda's sell-by date."

It has its moments, with some very solid dramatic acting work by its performers, but on the whole it is an admirable effort but also a major step down in quality from its predecessor. I personally feel they should have waited on a sequel, and take more time to figure out what to do with the Black Panther and Wakanda as the Marvel Cinematic Universe was progressing post Endgame and after the unfortunate passing of Chadwick Boseman. The loss of T'Challa is seriously felt in this story, and I think most would have been fine with a recast just a few years later, the new actor might not have been on Mr. Boseman's level, but they could have still performed the part well and carry the franchise further. As is, the mantle gets passed, and its executed just okay, but it would have more impact if the story were more focused. Namor is a nice addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and is adapted fine, I would certainly like to see more of him in later installments.

It opens with a pretty surprising emotional bang then goes from there. This movie is over 2 1/2 hours long but it seemed to just fly on by and my interest was held the whole entire way.

He did an excellent job with this movie and told an exciting story along the way.No spoilers but if the beginning of this doesn't grab your attention then something's wrong. I found it to be a surprising tribute but also a motivational piece of life goes on so you can never quit. Loss, hurt, regret, survivor's guilt, and other emotions make this feel more than just a comic book movie. Disney has a habit of trying to make everything politically safe but I'm glad Ryan Coogler didn't go that way. Instead he chose to focus more on the character's and their stories.

Chadwick as a brilliant fit for the part, he was T'Challa, and made the movie for me. But I really don't think they did enough with the character.So that being said, his absence was obtusely noticeable in this movie, I had a hard time relating to, or even liking the remaining characters. Winston Duke as M'Baku, and Martin Freeman as Ross were the only two that I really cared about.Marvel movies have always been known for the humour they manage to include, and excel at that fine balance between drama and comedy, with the possible exception of Thor Love & Thunder, which at times felt like it was played purely for laughs. But's that a whole other review.Frankly this mostly bored me. There were only 3 or 4 action scenes, with a lot of, mostly depressing dialogue in between. The shadow of Chadwick Boseman hung heavy over this. There were constant references to him throughout, and don't get me wrong, there should absolute have been a tribute in the movie, but at times it threatened to take over the story.Having been raised on Marvel Comics in the '70s and '80s, I also struggled with portrayal of Namor. In the comics he was depicted with almost oriental features, skinny, but built, and regal. In the movie he had more Indian / South American appearance, and just lacked that air of nobility. But that is probably nit picking from a comic book fan. Putting that aside, if you were not aware of Namor before seeing this, Tenoch Huerta made a good job as the villain.My daughter said, as we were walking out the cinema, ""That just didn't feel like a Marvel movie.""

He decided to reflect the real life tragedy in the story, and came with a poignant, emotional farewell to Chadwick. But unfortunately the story suffered massively for this decision. They had a great story to tell, but it never rose above mediocrity. Many unnecessary subplots and lame jokes took away the gravitas of the story. Namor and his nation of Talokan was very intriguing, Okoye's action scenes were really tense, Angela Bassett gave a fierce performance, fantastic Costume Designing and Music. But Shuri in this new avatar remains unconvincing, the hard shift her character takes doesn't feel earned. Also sloppy editing and pacing and the scale of the war felt wrong.

There are very few actors who can captivate the audience with their words none of those actors happened to be in this movie.The CGI was good and the action was pretty good.

Hearing she was cast without auditions taking place is unforgivable as she really adds nothing with her bad acting. It's not like she has proved anything before, as she was obviously chosen for all the wrong reasons & really takes away more than she gives ).I do wish her good luck in the future, however I just did not like her acting performance as hopefully with a better script she will do much better. I just did not find her acting at all believable or entertaining.Now Lupita Nyong'o & Angela Bassett ( who with her body of work behind her anyone would accept she would not need to audition ) we're both fantastic & really did fantastic acting & are a real credit to the acting profession, as I would have preferred Lupita to have been the new Black Panther however some decisions made little sense in this film for me. Tenoch Huerta was very good casting also as I did enjoy his commitment to his role ( as they were the 3 stars of the movie ).Just think how good they would have been with a much better script.The overall story + script writing by Ryan Coogler in Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is really poor & relies on totally illogical character motivations, which is a surprise as the first Black Panther film was a lot better ( it was like this story & script was rushed to cash in for Disney ), though I think the Directing was OK taking into account the bad script.As the story & directing are by the same person this is a real shame.Marvel Phase 4 ( in general ) has been an absolute disaster as in my honest opinion Black Widow was ( 7 out of 10 ) which looked below par compared to Marvel Phase 1 - 3 ( which in general were 8 to 10, out of 10 scored films ), however you accept Black Widow's own movie should have been done sooner & with a better script ( yet now it looks great in compassion to the vast majority of the other phase 4 films done, as the standard of Marvel films is phase four is mostly awful ).Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings I gave ( 7 out of 10 ) however this film had so much potential to be way better but was another real disappointment. The slide in Marvel quality could have recovered. Then came out Eternals ( 5 out of 10 ) which was were Marvel films died. Sony owns Spider-man ( so I've not watched no way home yet, as Eternals ruined it for me ), but as Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness was on Disney plus I thought the fist movie was so good I'll watch that, however D. S. I. T. M. O. M ( I gave 2 out of 10 ) has got to be one of the worst sequels I have ever watched, then I decided to watch Thor: Love and Thunder ( I gave 5 out of 10 ) so at this point I knew Marvel was 100% dead which is a real shame.The only marvel film I have any real hope for is Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 as with James Gunn in charge at least it will be great.So to sum up Black Panther Wakanda Forever ( 2022 ) is a forever disappointment compared to Phase 1 - 3 ( including Black Panther 2018 obviously ), but compared to the rest of Phase Four it is an average film ( so though it did not kill Marvel films it also did not give any hope for phase five that Marvel could some how actually recover, as personally the Marvel Universe is ruined for me ""Eternally"" as I have lost my ""Love"" with the lack of ""Thunder"" ). The Disney decision making process with Marvel films has proved total ""Madness"" to me, as Disney obviously put the wrong people in charge in deciding who should be writing the stories, scripts & directing in phase four as instead of looking for quality scripts that could stand the test of time they seem to give US$Billions to people who's politics they agree with unfortunately most people want talent over forced political opinions.Now James Gunn is in charge of DC films it will be interesting to see if he is able to raise DC's quality up to Marvel Phase 1 - 3, as how could Disney be so reckless to have allowed DC to take away their asset?( still Disney did not use Jame's Gunn talent instead they relied on Disney directors to make decisions with no history of any success ).Disney use to stand for the best quality, now it has lost that image."

They should have their own movie. When I first saw the trailer I thought they were going to be cheesy fish people, like Aquaman and his peeps, but Namor is far from cheesy. Aquaman can learn a lot from him. No need for orange spandex, hair extensions and poser tattoos.Everything else about Wakanda Forever is slow, boring, and repetitive.

Having written the entire script, then having to mourn the untimely death of your lead character is probably the most painful experience as a director. That being said he did an excellent job with the film and paying his respects to Chadwick Boseman.The first thing that I'd like to touch on is the story itself specifically how they dealt with Bosemans tragic passing. Cooglers method of handling it made sense throughout and created a lot of great emotion. The emotion throughout the film was top notch and it wasn't just the emotion involving T'Challa, there were plenty of elements that allowed the cast to showcase their talent and give quality performances.The acting across the board is fantastic. Letitia Weight did an incredible job stepping up to the leading role and I can't praise her enough. Angela Basset was phenomenal in this film and gave her all in every scene. Danai Gurira and Lupita Nyong's were both excellent in their respective roles.The rest of plot for the most part hit it's mark, but there was a subplot involving Martin Freeman's character that I felt didn't need to be there at all. Removing that element probably would've cut a good chunk of that 2 hours and 40 minute run time.Now the thing that I was most concerned about going into this film was Namor. The MCU has a history of poorly handling their villains so I had my doubts going in. In my opinion Namor is one of the best MCU villains to date. They actually gave him proper development and a motivation that makes sense.Although Namor was great his nation as an entirety was not as threatening. I didn't get the feeling that they were this all powerful nation that they kept describing them as. To me Namor was the threat and there were very few times where I felt that his nation had the upper hand to Wakanda.The final thing I'll touch on is Ironheart, on a surface level I like her character, obviously this isn't her film so she doesn't get that much development but at face value her character is cool. That being said if they were to take another look at the script I think they would've been able to write her out or reduce her involvement fairly easily. She has a crucial role at the beginning of the film but after that she is very much a tag along character and was only used as a comic relief. She does get some extra attention towards the end but nothing that really justified her involvement throughout. This isn't a big issue considering I did like her character, just something to note.Overall this is a great film. The emotional impact of Bosemans death and the development of our core characters is handled with grace, and the addition of Namor is extremely well done.8.5/10

Perhaps it would have been better to scrap it alltogether. On one hand, movies are a business, and after the stellar success of the first, the studio naturally wanted a sequel. An argument can also be made for working a eulogy into the movie an honoring the actor and character this way. On the other hand, working a real life death into a silly Marvel superhero action comedy is nearly impossible to pull off without feeling either tacked on or exploitative. To Marvel's credit, they avoided the latter. The tribute to Bosman felt respectful.It did, however, feel tacked on to a movie that never finds a tonal footing. We go from somber tragedy to silly over the top action and jokes to politics to cgi crapfest. Unlike the first film, which was tonally consistent except for the terribly made monorail fight, the sequel never knows what it wants to be. It feels like the studio was too afraid to do an actual serious, sombre Marvel movie, but also afraid of going too comedic, aka Thor Love and Thunder.They also left very little room for the antagonists, who remain not just underdeveloped but generally aren't very interesting or memorable. A superhero movie stands and falls with its villains, and Wakanda Forever's villains may be the worst ones yet in a Marvel film (yes, worse than Thor 2).Remember the days when Marvel would cast grizzled veteran actors as primary antagonists? Jeff Bridges, Mickey Rourke, Tim Roth, Kurt Russel, Guy Pierce, etc? They lent a certain level of gravitas to an otherwise forgettable villain. With these newer Marvel films, it's more about giant cartoon physics fights between CGI armies.It's predictable and underwhelming. To date, Marvel Phase 4 hasn't had a good film. They're heading straight for the same ice berg that sank Star Wars."

However, the film had a lot to tackle in a short two and half hours long movie. It did appeal heavily to emotions. Of course, the film focus on the mourning of T'Challa. But it also has an arduous task of attempting to fill those shoes and introduce us to a new world and antagonist. All of which can serve as a stand-alone central theme for a movie. With that being said, I had a tough time grappling with the development of the plot, the main issue, and how it all culminated. Unfortunately, the revenge aspect was the least convincing arc of this film.What stood out to me was the disrespect to tradition and the illogical methods afterward.Although some critiques ultimately led me to compare my feelings for the original Black Panther film, there were also some good ones.As I mentioned earlier, the emotions were on point. Angela Bassett acted her ass off in this movie. Also, what's a Marvel movie without a cameo or introducing a new character from the universe? Also, did we finally hear the word ""Mutant"" in the Marvel cinematic universe?Ultimately Wankada Forever has a lot going on; it thrives by including representation and political aspects while also incorporating three challenging elements of mourning, development, and integration. While that's positive, it is also a fault; I left the movie feeling underwhelmed by what I watched. I feel this is the filler movie that needed to tie up loose ends and project us into the next sequence. The ending credit scene was the icing on the cake. Therefore I rate Wakanda Forever a 7/10 3.5

But somehow director Ryan Coogler managed to overcome the Impossible by crafting a solid follow-up thanks in part to it's stellar cast.Right from the get-go we watch as the nation of wakanda is mourning the loss of its king. Grief plays a strong role in the story and we see how T'Challa's death impacts everyone he knew closely. From a mother, to a sister, to a lover, and even a rival turned friend. T'Challa's spirit no doubt hovers over this film & makes for some emotional and heartfelt moments. I cant imagine the difficult task going from supporting to main focus that Letitia Wright had to go up against. But she wonderfully plays Shuri again this time as not just a funny sidekick but now a righteous fighter struggling to carry her family's Legacy forward. It may be hard to see her as the new forefront of the franchise right now but only time will tell if it sticks. The standout performance was no doubt Angela Bassett as Queen Ramonda. You really believe this woman lost her son where it's hard to tell if she's grieving for T'Challa, or Boseman, or even both. All the Supporting Cast do excellent jobs growing as their characters and the addition of Dominique Thorne's Riri Williams/Ironheart makes for a very appealing new face to the MCU. Among this great tragedy is the coming of an underwater tribe called the Talokan led by the dominating Namor. Although he may not be as compelling as Eric killmonger from the last film he makes for a solid antagonist that's both ruthless and sympathetic.The movie has its hiccups. For the first 2 acts the movie feels like it really struggles to find its main character. Shuri seems to be made out as the lead but she goes in and out through the story and doesn't become much of the focus until the third act. Also while most the supporting cast worked for me the subplot with Martin Freeman's Agent Ross didn't seem to serve much purpose and couldve easily saved the movie's bloated runtime an extra 20 minutes.Black Panther Wakanda Forever was never gonna be as impactful as its first outing. But thanks to a strong cast, beautifully crafted visuals, fun action sequences, and of course the emotional weight of our lost hero, it makes for a worthy follow up that worked better than It had any right to."

There is a touching effort to honour Chadwick Boseman here. The Marvel opening logo sequence which normally showcases all the tentpole characters is dedicated exclusively to Boseman's Black Panther and there is some footage of him from the first film spliced in. His absence, however, is very strongly felt, leaving this second instalment somewhat flat.We need to talk about Prince Namor, the Submariner. His introduction to the MCU has been eagerly anticipated and certainly there are some things that get the character right including green shorts, winged ankles, pointy ears, and a surface-world hating narcissism. The character was created (by Bill Everett) in the Golden Age of comics, debuting in Marvel Comics #1 (1939). In WWII, he sunk both Allied and Axis ships with an equal hatred for the surface dwellers. This made him an interesting portrait in neutrality. Of course, once America entered the war he was enlisted to fight alongside Captain America and the Human Torch to smash Hitler and the 'Japanazis.' In the Silver Age he became a rival for the affections of Susan Storm and an antihero who often came up against the Fantastic Four and other Marvel heroes as a less than friendly semi-ally but he always kept his distance from tbe surface dwellers. In the 1980s he was rebooted by John Byrne as a business-suited corporate eco-warrior. He continues in the present timeline most prominently as a member of The Illuminati (though not included in the Doctor Strange: Multiverse of Madness (2022) iteration of that group).The major change in the MCU version is that Namor is reconfigured as a mutant descended from the ancient Mayans, rather than Lord of the undersea kingdom of Atlantis. I get that this provided an opportunity to set Latin American culture alongside African American culture in (potential) joint opposition to 'the colonisers' (a gag that worked well in the first film but is mercilessly flogged to death here through multiple repetitions). I'm not a purist and I understand that retconning is a staple of comic book creators. If it works in the world of sequential panels, there's no reason it can't work in cinema. It probably also helps to distance the character from DC's less than stellar derivative, Aquaman. Maybe it's my affection for the character but I just couldn't buy the Mayan thing. The blue skin, yes, and the kingdom under the seas, all good, but when Namor uttered his famous cry, 'Imperius Rex!' it fell a little flat for me, given the reconfiguration of the origin story. Mexican actor, Tenoch Huerta, does a fine job but in all the Submariner comics I've read, I've never heard a South American accent in my head. Okay, maybe that's my problem and not the film's but, still, it affected my enjoyment of it.Enough about Namor. The film is nominated for five Oscars, including Best Music, Best Costume Design, Best Special Effects and Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role (Angela Bassett as Ramonda). Martin Freeman is back as the White Guy and Julia Louise-Dreyfus is introduced as his ex-wife and government agent. Letitia Wright is back in the role of Shuri and gives a good performance as do other cast members returning to their characters. There has to be a replacement for a new Black Panther and there are two offered here that indicate that Marvel wants to keep this hugely successful character in the mix. Whether it can survive without Chadwick Boseman's definitive performance is yet to be seen."

The story for this movie is unlike any other Marvel movie we've seen so far. There's so much raw emotion in this movie that will make everybody say either I'm not crying, you're crying or someone's cutting onions in here. But for the most part that's only the first part of this movie. The story of this movie is split into three different parts and they try to connect them seamlessly but it doesn't always work. The only parts of this movie's story that connect seamlessly are the second and third parts. I will give the movie this they tried to connect the first part into the third part and it did work. But honestly, nothing could save the second part of this movie's story from not being the slowest part of this movie. This movie is 2 hours and 41 minutes long and honestly, it didn't need to be that long. There's a lot of filler in this movie that easily could've been removed and nothing would've been missed. But at the end of the day, this movie just didn't feel like an MCU movie. There weren't that many jokes being shoved down your throat constantly or some slapstick just because. This movie just felt like a movie honouring a man who was lost way too early. This all can be traced back to one man who's Ryan Coogler, the writer and director. Ryan Coogler understood that once Chadwick Boseman had passed this movie had to honour him and his impact and did that flawlessly. Those who saw this movie either having not seen a previous Marvel movie with Black Panther in it could still understand the impact Chadwick Boseman had on those around him. (Continued in Comments)He wrote this movie so beautifully and I would love to read what the original script was. It wasn't just his writing that made this movie but also his directing of it. He brings the same passion he had for the first movie to this one as well. He knew exactly how to get some kind of emotional reaction out of the audience or how to just keep their attention throughout this movie. It's due to Ryan Coogler's wonderful story and directing that all of the acting performances in this movie feel so raw. You could easily tell that every actor in this movie wanted to make this movie as great of a movie as can be to honour Chadwick Boseman. Due to this, it's hard to tell if this is the character's grief or the actors but no matter what it brings the audience to tears as well. There are so many amazing performances in this movie that it's hard to pick a favourite but I have to say that Letitia Wright really stood out. This movie mainly follows her and her journey of accepting that her brother is dead. She brought so much to this character that you really feel for her character and what she's going through. She goes on this emotional rollercoaster that anyone who has lost a close loved one can relate to her. But Shuri wasn't the only one to go through an emotional rollercoaster but Queen Ramonda, played by Angela Bassett, also goes on one and it's amazing. Obviously, the biggest difference between Shuri and Queen Ramonda is the fact she lost her son and Angela Bassett shows that so well. She has so many emotional moments and all of them hit so hard that it leaves the audience on the verge of tears. Whenever she was on the screen she held the audience's attention with every single word she said. She shows how much Queen Ramonda cares for her family and how this loss has affected her in more ways than one. This movie also introduced the audience to two new characters in the MCU and I can't wait to see more of them. The first one we got to meet is Riri, played by Dominique Thorne, and I can't wait for her solo show. Dominique Thorne played her in such a way that she knows she's smart but doesn't brag about it. (Continued below)She's this sympathetic character who just wants to do the right thing. I also love how down-to-earth she plays Riri. She reminds us that despite being a child prodigy she is just a kid who gets excited over things no matter how small. We don't get to see much of her in this movie so I can't wait to see how she'll expand the character in her own show. The other character we meet is Namor and I really hope we get to see more of him. Namor is easily one of the best MCU villains and that's all thanks to Tenoch Huerta's performance. He plays Namor in such a way you don't know whether he's a villain or not. He's this sympathetic guy that you can kind of understand where he's coming from. Unfortunately, we don't get to fully experience why exactly he's doing this but no matter what, Tenoch Huerta does a memorable job and I can't wait to see him in more MCU movies to come. A trademark of Marvel recently has been the bad CGI and for me personally, the CGI here wasn't bad at all. The CGI looked pretty good and helped the audience really feel like they were there in this underwater civilization. This also could be due to the darkness but I want to give them some credit okay. The last thing I'll mention is the music in this movie, composed by Ludwig Göransson. The music in this movie was incredible and really helped the scenes they were accompanying. Whether the scene was a sad one or one of tension the music matched perfectly to it. It wasn't just the musical score either but the regular music as well that helped this movie out. Through the actor's performances and the background music, the audience could easily figure out what exactly is going on and how to feel. In the end, Black Panther Wakanda Forever might not be the most perfect movie but you can feel how much emotion was put into making it. Definitely a good send-off to both phase 4 of the MCU and Chadwick Boseman."

Many of the critics have trashed it as bloated and boring. I can agree on the first criticism, but not with the second. Considering the events under which it was being made, this is actually a really good movie.As the movie opens, T'Challa is dying. His genius sister, Shuri (Letitia Wright) is frantically trying to develop a cure. Sadly, he passes. The kingdom of Wakanda is thrown into crises as T'Challa's mother, Ramonda (Angela Bassett) becomes queen. She resents the council as they aligned with Kilmonger in the original movie, but she does trust M'Baku (Winston Duke) who took her in during that trying time. After an international survey team discovers vibranium on the depths of the ocean floor, a society of ocean dwellers known as Talokans appear and kill them. Their king, Namor (Tenoch Huerta) emerges from the ocean wishing to form an alliance with Wakanda. When this alliance does not work out, a battle ensures between the two nations. Shuri is kidnapped by Namor while being guarded by Okoye on a mission to rescue a young scientist, Riri (Dominique Thorne). In a rage, Queen Ramonda removes Okoya from the Royal Guard and enlists the aid of Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o), T'Challa's former girlfriend.The cast is really good and you can sense the pall that fell over them making this movie. The funeral scene for T'Challa is moving and intense. Its probably the highlight of the film as the pace and choreography are perfect. Angela Bassett brings plenty of gravitas to the scene and Letitia Wright is appropriately grief stricken. The backstory for Namor is well handled and kind of makes sense since a meteor did hit the Yukutan peninsula (bringing the vibranium that was later discovered) as well as explaining the sudden disappearance of the Mayans as they became sea dwellers.Where the movie falters is the run time and the need to keep impressing upon us how smart Shuri and Riri are by having them do some serious mental gymnastics. (This is an issue with all of the Marvel movies to include Tony Stark figuring out time travel overnight). Also, Nakia's rescue of Shuri and Riri is pretty preposterous. There is an implied love story between Namor and Shuri that had some serious potential for audience by in and character conflict, but it gets dropped almost immediately. Its a shame because some of this run time could have been used for a romance plot to give the proceedings some stakes for the final conflict. And that is my other big critique of the film. The final battle is just a CGI mess. Looks like a bunch of ants running around on a toy boat.This was a good effort to keep the legacy of the Black Panther alive. While it is not perfect, it was entertaining and I wasn't bother so much by the run time as I was by the use of it. The acting and cast are top-notch. The scenery is beautiful and the cultural touches are wonderful."

Don't get me wrong, this is not a bad movie and I don't want to sour anyone's opinion in watching it. But like with almodt everything in phase 4, temper, temper, temper your expectations. The movie at times can pay beautiful homages to Chadwick Boseman, and then in other times it builds you up and as a viewer and lover of the Marvel films, you feel like it would be a perfect time for another touching moment to reflect on Boseman's legacy, and it will totally drop the ball. And then on top of all that, the story for this feel has to be one of the weakest (except for Thor: Love & Thunder). I feel like Marvel studios thinks that if they put in enough jokes and enough comic references that we will look over lazy writing. But they are wrong! And I am deeply upset that showed that in this film most of all. Letitia Wright was amazing as ever in this film and carried it a lot. But there is only so much she can do.

The bet was risky after the unfortunate death of Chadwick Boseman, but the intelligence to close a chapter and open another by its director is a truly remarkable result, who says goodbye to our Black Panther in the most poetic and deserved way.After what was done, we fully entered into a proposal that continues with that commercial cinema that is supposed to be Marvel, but that does not lose the essence of a director who does not hesitate to put his own look at what he has to offer.It is a film that at all times processes to be serious maintaining the line of its predecessor, giving a tonality full of roots and culture to a film that gives us the most rooted superhero in the entire Marvel cinematographic universe.As I thought with its first installment, the seriousness with which the entire world of Wakanda and its culture is faced allows us to enter into a challenge as spectators, to feel qualified or not to receive more forceful proposals than a set of action sequences and jokes to release tension.That is the challenge that gives you to understand the true spectacle that turns out to be the world that Ryan Coogler proposes with his Black Panther. Proof of that is managing to give an actress the first Oscar nomination for playing a character in Marvel, as is the absolutely brutal performance of Angela Bassett who is pure feeling and emotions in her presence throughout her time on screen. That scene facing Okoye justifies understanding what is really behind Coogler's proposal.It is also valid to be able to connect or not with the proposal that they offer us, that is left to the judgment of each viewer and what they expect to receive when going to see Black Panther 2.In great detail it is a film that maintains the level of its first installment, which has an excess of footage for those who are looking for something different and more dynamic, it is really a film that if you do not connect from the beginning it is very difficult for you to process its duration in a positive way.It is also true that it falls into the same mistakes as several of the previous films, that of inconsequentially handling certain characters that end up being more connectors or triggers for conflicts rather than a real contribution to the story or to the film itself.Cases like the character of Martin Freeman or Julia Louis-Dreyfus that feel like just an ornament that could not be there or the most graphic case, the little connection that is achieved with Dominique Thorne and her role as Riri. On the contrary, we have the splendid use that is given to Namor and everything that corresponds to his culture and his actions that Tenoch Huerta interprets in a solid way, as well as the testimony that Letitia Wright receives as the new Black Panther, a background and a path by which he takes the character that makes it clear to us what his director is really looking for with all this.A film that generated diverse opinions, but that in its central nucleus once again gives it a little more blood and shows that superhero cinema can also be without as much spectacle as we are used to."

If Wakanda Forever gets anything right it is being respectful to the late great actor. From the intro Marvel title sequence montage of his greatest moments, to the commemoration at the end. They treated his legacy with care and consideration, and especially no CGI resurrections (cough *Star Wars reboots*).About an hour of the film is setup and retcons, which is when I fell asleep. The second act is primarily character development and world building, primarily led by the amazingly talented Angela Basset. Unfortunately, Queen Ramonda doesn't get as much screen time as the much less interesting Shuri, played by Letitia Wright. Wright is a fine actor, but as a protagonist Shuri doesn't have nearly enough depth to carry a whole film. Her struggle involves revenge and grief, generic conflicts even reused from the prior film.Shuri's character arc feels very redundant by the end, but hey, at least the CGI was awesome. The last third is almost all flashy greenscreen action scenes, directed well enough. Just don't go into it expecting memorable set-pieces, unique characters, or a revolutionary story.

His family even requested it and the studio should have agreed, because this movie was not any good. Story pelt weak and long and drawn out. The princess is a good character but not the lead, which is why they needed a black panther character. Not to say it needed to be a male role but just someone with a commanding presence. As for Wakanda itself, I have always had a problem why it had to be in Africa and not on some remote island, like Wonder Woman. To have a society that is superiors with technology, wealth, medical, and weapons be in a continent that has such a bad history of poverty and genocide just seems far from reality and selfish. It's not as if they discovered the metal, it was from an asteroid. Not sure they should continue this character now, even in Avenger movies as it lost a lot of credit from this mess."

First and foremost, Ryan Coogler wants this to be a serious and high-minded superhero film: it plays with heavy themes of imperialism & vengeance, includes plenty of long sit down talks about those themes, and checks off almost every desire for a diverse cast. Second, the film tries to be a sequel to ""Black Panther"" despite the hole left by the deceased Chadwick Boseman. Lastly, the film tries to be part of the wider MCU, introducing new kingdoms and characters to the ongoing MCU story. The three never fully mesh and often act against each other. The high minded part of the film thankfully gives us some beautiful and imaginative art direction as well as a great musical score, but it unfortunately just feels like a rehash of the same questions the first one brought up. It bloats the film and cuts off any of the fun spectacle that the second two goals were trying to accomplish. On that second goal, the film is just not able to replace the charisma that Boseman brought. Shuri is a nice secondary character, but whether its due to the writing/direction/performance, she just isn't as compelling, decisive, or believable as a main. Lastly, having to conform to the formula of an MCU film often led to those serious sequences being undercut by a dumb and subpar, but mandatory as an MCU film, action sequence. I'd be a bit more forgiving of the attempt to be serious if there was much interesting in what the film was trying to says. In one example, we have a serious moment between the Queen and Shuri (who is a strong scientist) where Shuri doubts her mother's belief that the passed away T'Challa is in the wind like she is experiencing. I thought, maybe the film will be an interesting discussion of science vs. Faith that will have ramifications for the MCU...but Shuri eventually takes the same ""protector liquid"" that takes people to the ancestral plane and is just proved wrong. No thoughtful discussions here - the decision to keep the MCU intact wins out. Another example, but going the other way is a moment where Shuri has her new strength (from the protector liquid) and puts on the Black Panther suit and like a strong main character she is dropped right into the middle of the discussion of whether to go to war with Namor and his tribe. This conversation feels like it goes on and on and gets bogged down with the seriousness and moral ambiguity the director wants for the film. This should have been an easy decision in the MCU direction - you partner Shuri's first appearance with the black panther suit with a triumphant black and white ""I'm the new blank panther moment"" audience cheer, not with a drawn-out ambiguous war discussion. But that didn't happen because Coogler wants Shuri to be wrong here - driven by vengeance and the real problem is not with the misunderstandings between the two noble oppressed groups, but with the devious American imperializers. Think about this encapsulation of the film, we essentially get the female reboot of Iron Man in this film and it's this throw away storyline that the film really doesn't care about and is so generic that I literally could write, ""black female college student that is high tech smarter than others"" and you'd know pretty much everything about her the film wants to tell us. I wasn't a big fan of the first Black Panther film, but at least that one was more focused and anchored with by Bosewick's moral integrity. This one is a mess."

Filming was interrupted with rewrites prompting reshoots as the film's release was delayed and Letitia Wright's controversial time on Twitter didn't help matters much.Wakanda Forever was tasked with building on the first film and concluding Marvel's Phase 4 as a new villain enters the picture, and a new hero is forced to step up and become the Black Panther. Wakanda is pressured by the rest of the world to share its vibranium resource, but Queen Ramonda (Angela Bassett) refuses so these political headbutts soon start to cause dangerous ripples. The bad guy this time is Namor, played by Tenoch Huerta Mejía, who breaks into Wakanda, threatening the country with an attack if he is not given the scientist who designed a machine capable of detecting vibranium.Losing the main actor in the franchise was always going to prove challenging for the filmmakers but the approach taken here feels appropriate: after T'Challa is given a considerable, moving send-off, the story continues and Shuri (Letitia Wright) eventually assumes the mantle. Having not one but two massive funerals in a film as lengthy as this one does hurt the pacing of the movie quite a bit, however. This is definitely a film that could have done with a bit of a trim but one suspects that necessary changes to the script caused the budget to inflate too much already so changing the entire plot was not really an option, which is understandable.All of that aside, this is a good sequel and the best film in Marvel's Phase 4 by far. The action sequences are big and exciting, the cast is on top form, there's plenty of drama and intrigue to hold onto, Namor is an interesting foe who lives in a bit of a grey area like Killmonger did and the new culture that is introduced is fascinating. The film takes what worked so well in the first Black Panther and puts it on a more global scale. On the minus side, the introduction of Riri Williams (Dominique Thorne) falls resoundingly flat and Lupita Nyong'o is barely given anything to do as Nakia, a character that has felt criminally underwritten since the first movie.Black Panther: Wakanda Forever isn't a perfect film by any stretch, and it's hardly one of Marvel's very best, but it remains a thoroughly entertaining sequel with new environments to discover, characters going through a lot emotionally and a well done build-up to an all-out war that is worth the watch alone.Solid."

I don't have the same energy to hit the theaters anymore when MARVEL's new movie releases. I had my doubts with respect to Wakanda Forever as well, but after hearing about its great tribute to Chadwick Boseman, I went to the cinemas to watch it anyway.The trailer pretty much gives away where the plot is going and also who would be the new Black Panther. The initial T'challa tribute scenes are very heartwarming and also brilliantly shot. The sound design for those scenes is top notch. The plot continues to go around the obvious Vibranium arc afterwards. Despite the ""coming together"" events in Avengers: Endgame, we go back to square 1 where Wakanda is again distancing itself from the power and resource hungry world leaders. The introduction of the antagonist Namor and his tribe brings back the energy up to a certain level. However the film doesn't really justify the acts of Namor and also the battle in the end doesn't really intrigue as much,The characters in this movie carry heavy emotions and they do deliver well especially tying it to T'challa's death. I still believe there could have been something more added to that part of the story. Letitia Wright as Shuri carries herself with ease along with Angela Basset as Ramonda. But I personally feel that Ramonda's role isn't significant enough to grant Basset an oscar nomination for this movie. Tenoch Huerta's intense performance as Namor is definitely a standout and a great introduction for the actor. However, the other characters are not so impactful mainly because of them working with new supporting characters who are introduced in the movie. Although the movie is long, it doesn't provide enough substance to roles of Okoye, M'Baku, Oyo and Namora. Less I said about RiRi is better as I feel it was a very forced and poorly written character. I know that there's future for RiRi's role in the MARVEL universe and will wait to see how it pans out.Wakanda Forever is a weird movie to judge. It has a great tribute to Chadwick, but I don't think the movie itself is one. It is a decent watch for the Black Panther fans but quite a tiresome for the rest."

I didn't feel the time to be honest.The performances in this were also very strong. Angela Basset, Danai Gurira, Lupita Nyong'o and Letita Wright all had to give emotional heavy performances that had you wondering whether they were acting or just being real... Whilst there was limited comedy (rightly so) it was funny and memorable whenever it came :).I really enjoyed the villains too. The civilisation were interesting (albeit a bit Avatar - The Way of the Water like - That isn't being released until next month) and their leader (Namor) is a strong impressive presence in the film.The music was fire - Both the soundtrack with Tems, Rihanna, Stormzy, Burna Boy etc and the original score by Ludwig Gorannson who is one of my favourite composers. The CGI was on point too. It has generally been hit and miss during phase 4 but there were only a couple of moment i questioned which is very impressive given the nature of the villain's powers.A worthy follow up to the original Black Panther and a fitting tribute to Chadwick Boseman throughout.P.s The man next to me definitely in tears by the end of the film 😢"

The score was particularly captivating this time around. But none of this could save the film from its pacing, clarity and consistency issues.Even if we forget the outright errors (where the audio didn't match the visuals), the film just had a lot of awkward silence, like the actors were expecting quick cuts and were just waiting for direction. There were hundreds of places I would have cut a second here, two seconds there, enough not only to bring some energy into the pacing, but also to buy more time to understand Namor's people. Little time is spent really getting to empathize with them. Even Namor's story lacked clarity and fleshing out.More than 90 minutes in, the story finally started to get interesting, with noteworthily well-done action sequences. But even then, it was painfully obvious that some sequences where done by entirely different teams, with completely inconsistent tonality. So it was hard to enjoy the good parts, with how different they were from the rest.I admit I had high hopes for the final film of Phase 4, but this just didn't deliver."

Chadwick's death hit hard on everybody, but I still want to see the character's story and journey in the MCU, but I guess the studio see that Chadwick is irreplaceable, which is understandable, but I also think they should wait awhile to start production of this film. Ever since Phase 4 started, it has been overall mediocre to begin with. The only acceptable of good out of this phase was Spider-Man: No Way Home and Shang-Chi. The rest of the movies and Disney shows have potential with good moments in them, but it all falls flat with its writing, direction, and some weird agenda they have going on. Because of this, BP: Wakanda Forever will be my last MCU film. After Endgame ended, things haven't been the same. Now, my review.I enjoyed the tribute for Chadwick at the beginning of the movie and Shuri was up next to the throne of Wakanda. After that, it became slow-paced film. There were some good jokes in there, but I wish they could tone it down a bit from one character. I don't like how they dumb down Shuri's character being how she's supposably a smart character into what she is in the film. The editing of this film is a bit weird and the final fight scene was over the place. Namor was a good antagonist, but not as good as the other bad guy characters in the rest of the MCU. The movie was overall an average action superhero movie. I don't think it will be memorable as the first movie since the movie felt high spirited and the second film was just fine."

Namor (aka Sub-Mariner) of the original comics (one of Marvel's very first created characters in 1939) was always rebellious, short-tempered, arrogant.... but also a masterful tactician creating 'expedient' tenuous alliances sometimes with heroes (like the Fantastic Four) but also villains like Doctor Doom, always believing that Land-dwellers could never be trusted and would eventually bring calamity & destruction to his underwater Utopia. The original Marvel comics featuring Sub-Mariner were always interesting but 'Wakanda Forever' again seemed to bring added dimensions to Namor with even more complex motivations and a point-of -view that audiences could at least partially sympathize with (Namor's origin scene harkening back to 1500's when conquistadors bring disease & destruction, ravaging a peaceful Mayan village, was brief but indelibly chilling). The Best and most interesting adversaries in films & stories are never pure mindless 'villains' but those who have a complex moral code that traverses the spectrum of good & evil and are unpredictable in dispensing mercy and retribution.Overall, I really liked Wakanda Forever but it was not what I was expecting.... the vibe is much different than the original Black Panther (and other heroic endeavors) with scenes that run the gamut of meditative, intense, heartfelt, conflicted, reflective & revealing but always with an undercurrent of poignancy.... ensuring that Wakanda's Legend is certainly secure and deserves to live on thru the far-future."

Tenoch Huerta played Namor as the antagonist in Wakanda Forever pretty good as he imposed a threat to Wakanda and the people of it.

Unlikely to make the same impact as the original, Wakanda Forever is a mature and effective Marvel outing
A cultural phenomenon that was the rare type of film that struck a chord with critics, audiences, box office booths and the awards circuits, 2018's Black Panther was one of the most resounding success stories of the Marvel cinematic universe, with it always going to be a tough task for returning director Ryan Coogler to strike the same gold he did with his beloved first foray into the Marvel world.The task Coogler and his creative partners faced was made all the monumental by the tragic and shattering passing of T'Challa/Black Panther himself Chadwick Boseman, the type of heartbreaking real life loss the Marvel world has never had to overcome before in this way but against all the odds Black Panther: Wakanda Forever succeeds in somehow working with the passing of Boseman to make a cohesive film, that may not be ground-breaking, but offers up a very different type of Marvel film that is centred and driven by grief both imagined and real.Undoubtedly an entirely different film than the one that was first being developed by Coogler, Forever wastes little time dealing with T'Challa's demise and all of the films sombre moments of respect and consideration for the life of both the character and Boseman in turn is handled with aplomb here and when moving through the films (sadly overlong) 160 minute runtime, it's not too see and feel that this is an entirely different type of Marvel exercise that thankfully places the off-kilter comedic focussed mode it's been operating in since the early Guardians and Thor: Ragnarok days to deliver a more mature offering that's fairly likely to not win over the younger fans that have made Marvel their own over the last decade.With Boseman and T'Challa no longer the central focus of the Black Panther universe, much extra weight has been added onto the likes of Letitia Wright's Shuri, Angela Bassett's Ramonda, Winston Duke's M'Baku and Danai Gurira's Okoye, with all returning players once more delivering the goods for Coogler on the acting front with Wright in particular impressing with a character that is now largely far removed from the one we initially saw in the original.As is usually the case with a Marvel outing some of the best moments in Forever stem from the new players with Dominique Thorne's feisty and gung-ho Riri likely to be a new fan favourite (even if her role here is slightly forced) while Tenoch Huerta's new adversary Namor is one of the more effective ""villains"" Marvel has introduced in the cinematic landscape since the full reveal of Thanos many moons ago.Mostly recognisable from some TV work and mid-tier feature films, Huerta's take on the underwater dwelling Namor is a massive win for the film and much like Killmonger in the 2018 outing, his performance and character arc provides much weight to a film that without him may have felt like a lesser event, with motivations one can understand up to a point and enough development and growth where we can see so much potential both good and bad, Huerta and in turn Namor make us wish for more exploration of a whole new kingdom of Marvel that is hopefully explored even more than it is successfully but briefly looked at here.Another element of Forever that must be made note of and celebrated is the work of composer Ludwig Göransson who creates one of the most unique and noticeably effective Marvel scores we've yet encountered and while his work in the first film and other recent outings such as Tenet and The Mandalorian TV series showcase a talented artist at work, this is the type of score that heralds in the official arrival of a composer that could be about to shake the industry up in all the right ways.With a lot of elements to enjoy, Forever is unlikely to have the same type of impact either culturally or narratively as the first outing did and there will be some that find Coogler's close to three hour epic overly long in the tooth with a sagging middle section the most notable instance of running through the motions, while some side characters that appear set to play bigger parts merely come and go when it pleases the story, with the film at its best when it allows the likes of Shuri and Namor the time they deserve in the spotlight, especially without an Avenger or an unnecessary cameo in sightFinal Say -Considering the odds stacked against it, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is without question another success story for Marvel but not everything pays off in Coogler's high-reaching outing that overstays its welcome at times and may find itself fairly/unfairly judged against an original it's not going to match for impact or sentiment."

It wasn't bad, and it was certainly far from great. The fact that it got nominated for best picture is a joke. For the majority of this film however, I found myself to be really liking it. The slower pace, and cinematography were aspects that I was not expecting to appreciate. Sadly there are a few issues that really bog it down for me. The first one being that there is a new Black Panther, I won't say who but I think it would've been more impactful if no one took on the mantle. The Ironheart character felt extremely underdeveloped. And the climax was very unsatisfying. Overall this film is about as Oscar worthy as it's predecessor, in that it's not Oscar worthy at all."

The beginning moments of the film were heartbreaking to watch, but we got to see how it would affect the characters throughout the movie. I don't actively read the comics so the ""villain"" of the story was shocking for me, the character was interesting but I didn't feel too interested. However, after some time and more of the storyline had been revealed it did get exciting but it took some time to get there (almost the 2-hour mark). Also, the ending was heartwarming and we got to see the main character Shuri get the closure that they were looking for, we got to see her journey on how she had to rediscover herself and work towards her goals. Unfortunately, there was no post-credit scene but I am looking forward to another Black Panther movie.Other details that I should mention: Very good action scenes (I'm not a professional) but they did look realistic and I like how they changed throughout the film. I really liked the characters and their development/growth was nice to watch, I especially loved the mother-daughter relationship because it didn't follow the ""typical"" media portrayal as toxic or tense but as a fun duo who look out for one another. Additionally, I loved the music and different portrayals of the diverse cultures, it shows that the universe in the movie is bigger than just the main characters. However, I did see an overuse of some special effects and once I noticed it was hard to look away. Also, I expected the ending, as soon as I saw the character I knew what was happening I personally don't like those storylines because I feel like it starts a cycle.

But at least Thor 4 didn't take almost three hours to suck so badly.Letitia Wright, as Princess Shuri, was just fine playing a sidekick role and providing some comic relief in ""Black Panther,"" supporting Chadwick Boseman. But forced by his death to take over the lead, she just can't cut it, having neither the acting ability nor the screen presence to carry a movie, let alone the physicality to portray a believable super-hero. Angela Basset, normally an excellent actress of depth and gravitas, is relegated to petulant screaming and temper tantrums until she is mercifully allowed to be killed off. And while Dominique Thorne did well in her role as the black female Tony Stark, after being the driving character for the first act, she was simply forgotten for much of the rest of the movie, until debuting as Ironheart, in a suit that looked like a design rejected for the Power Rangers movie.Granted, the death of the starring actor left the producers in a bad situation, but writing out the character was the wrong answer. I can't help but think that simply recasting T'Challa would have been a better solution. It would have been difficult to replace Boseman, but if nothing else, maybe they could have attracted better writers.The cgi was adequate, but wasted on implausible scenes and badly-choreographed fight scenes, which came and went with no more lasting effect than a dance scene in a Baliwood musical. The dialog was bland, the plot was thin and unrealistic, and the villian was not only poorly-motivated and ultimately unthreatening, but frankly silly-looking (pigeon wings on his ankles, seriously?)I'm glad I didn't see this dumpster fire in the theater, but waited until it was streaming on Disney, so that I didn't waste $15; the bad news is that I wasted almost three hours of my life. Unfortunately, ""Wakanda Forever"" is just another example of how the Disney movie-by-committee format is bringing down yet another once-great franchise."

After the real life death of Chadwick Boseman, who played King T'Challa of Wakanda in the first Black Panther, it looked like this film was on the verge of not being made, but Ryan Coogler pulled off the impossible and made it work while also following key details from the comics. The film honors Chadwick Boseman in the best way that can be done and is probably one of the saddest movies of the MCU. Shuri played by Letitia Wright steps into the shoes as the lead character in this film and pulls it off successfully while using real life elements to fill in the shoes of her on screen brothers role. This is also hands down Angela Bassett's best role she's ever done as the current leader of Wakanda following King T'Challa's passing and as well as one of the best performances by an actor/actress in the MCU and superhero movies period. She steals the show in every single scene she is in and knows how to grab the audiences attention making her one of the standout characters of this film. Tenoch Huerta who played the villain Namor is phenomenal and one of my favorite villains currently in the MCU. He brought us a villain that wasn't always bad and always tried to do things for the best of his people, making him a villain that audiences alike can relate too. It was great to see some of the old cast from the first Black Panther again as well as newcomers such as Riri Williams Iron Heart. It's also worth noting that the visual effects on this movie were probably some of the best to come out of Phase 4. Overall, this is a powerful film mixed with real life elements that pulled off what was thought to be impossible to do, only to pull it off in the end in a big way. Rating 8/10."

Dir. Ryan Coogler
Rating: 7/10When I found out that Ryan Coogler had finished the script of this installment before Chadwick Boseman died, I respected him even more. I can't comprehend the struggle of rewriting the story because the protagonist, sadly, passed away. When you watched 'Wakanda Forever,' you can see that Coogler pays a loving tribute not just to T'Challa but to Chadwick too. The amount of respect and honor they showed to Chadwick in this movie translates to the audience. The opening scene alone is probably the most heartbreaking scene in the MCU franchise, and I love how they did not try to mask the death of Chadwick, instead, they opened the film with characters struggling with the loss of T'Challa that they did not expect and fully understand, and we can relate to that as an audience because his death was a shock for us as well. They did the best thing they could to address something so unfortunate.'Black Panther: Wakanda Forever' tried to venture into the ""slow-burn"" genre where they take a deep dive into the characters' stories and it felt overstuffed. There are a lot of stories to follow up, and the constant flashbacks are jarring and overdone. It felt like spoon-feeding too much. Namor's story is explored very well, but I really did not connect with it. There are a lot of flashbacks and I never really felt the pain that the writer wanted me to feel, considering that Namor is being set up as the antagonist, it did not feel vital compared to Killmonger's story. The thing is, it was somehow addressed in the last part of the film, but it did not have that much depth to it.For me, it was the excellent performances that carried this movie throughout. Angela Bassett gave us an Oscar-worthy performance, she was terrific and heartbreaking. Lupita Nyong'o, as always, is phenomenal. But, Letitia Wright as Shuri, is a revelation. It is hard to fill in the shoes of Chadwick Boseman, but she did not do it in a way that is disrespectful to the character, she has done it on her own and she shines in this film.'Black Panther: Wakanda Forever' is far from perfect, but they have served their purpose and Coogler has finished this film with flying colors despite the sudden changes in the writing after the death of Chadwick. This is a thoughtful and mature exploration of collaborative grief and loss. Also, 'Wakanda Forever' has better CGI effects than the first film. 'Wakanda Forever' tightens the impossible by paying tribute and giving emotional importance to the loss of the great, Chadwick Boseman, while confidently giving an unexpected path to the future of the franchise. The film is 2 hours and 41 minutes long, and it felt overstuffed and overloaded with stories, but 'Black Panther: Wakanda Forever' is MCU's most emotional and mature film."

Guys, it's so bad. I think Angela Bassett deserved two oscars not one, not for her acting, but just for reading what must be some of the worst lines in the history of film! The movie is so bad that you often need to remind yourself this is not Aquaman. Aren't Marvel movies becoming worse with every new one that comes out?Here's the one interesting thing in the entire movie, which seems to be pulled directly from the comic books. The bad guy is named Namor, which he explains as being short for ""Sin Amor"", ""Without Love"" in Spanish. Well, yes, that's a really cheesy origin for the name, and in his place, I might have also tried to hide it into Namor. But what's interesting is that beyond that tacky story, Namor is an anagram for Roman. Which the name of Ramonda, Queen of Wakanda, almost is also. In a film focused on portraying minorities, the mixing of characters names with the ultimate symbol of European descent (the Roman empire), as well as between heroes and villains, certainly leaves you thinking. That alone is the only intriguing, thought-provoking element of Wakanda Forever.I am probably late for most, but if you haven't seen it, you're on time to add almost three hours back to your life."

After a decade of fantastic movies with only a few being B grade, it is astounding how consistently BAD phase 4 is.She Hulk and Wakanda are a perfect conclusion to this phase, dumb writing through and through.

Nonsensical & difficult to follow; except the French are bad?I dunno. Was lost after a few minutes. I can understanding the opening tribute, but the real life loss of Chadwick has been allowed to affect the fantasy resulting in confusion. The script was tripping over itself to tie up loose ends & in doing so created more confusion.There is also the issue of agendas & accessibility. In my opinion, comic book fantasy adaptations shouldn't be geared for a specific race & the Black Panther films are. The Blade trilogy, for example, was about a lead black super hero, but at no time do these films alienate others. They weren't made primarily for an African American audience & the fact the Black Panther films have been is alarming & creepy; especially as they appropriate pseudo sub Saharan culture to do so. There's something off about that.Anyway. I'm sure a film adaptation of Black Panther could be done much better, with more warmth.

For the most part, anyway.The action scenes are pretty well done and the scale of the movie is much bigger than the first one. I remember people complaining about the CGI in the last movie. Don't worry, it looks far better in 'Wakanda Forever'.It does feel more of an ensemble movie. But that also means the plot kind of jumps from one point to another following different characters. Some do a nice job.Angela Bassett is excellent as Queen Ramonda. It's no wonder she got an Oscar nomination. Winston Duke is pretty good as M'Baku but he's not onscreen that much. Honestly, the teen scientist chick is not that interesting yet she gets a huge chunk of the story dedicated to her even being there Letitia Wright is the main protagonist and she's okay but I just preferred Chadwick Boseman.I have to admit that I feel sad that he's not in the movie given his untimely passing and they just killed off the character of T'Challa. It leaves the movie with a melancholy tone that seems appropriate. But it's not always fun to watch.Tenoch Huerta is the main villain as Namor the Sub-Mariner. His motivation is understandable but I cannot say it makes him interesting. I think the movie wants Namor to be more sympathetic than he actually comes off as onscreen. He's a lot more of a jerkass than what they probably intended. Although I'm surprisingly not laughing at the tiny wings on his feet helping Namor fly.The MCU version of Atlantis actually look intimidating and their introduction into the story is a suspenseful set-piece. The design of their culture taking cues from Mesoamerican civilizations like the Maya is an inspired one. Although I will admit, the lighting is pretty dim during the Atlantis scenes so I couldn't always get a good look. It's a unique approach but I think I prefer the version we saw in the DCEU's Aquaman movie.Ryan Coogler's direction is good. There is nothing wrong with the fight choreography or how the plot beats unfold. It's a competently made and reasonably entertaining entry into the ever expanding Marvel Cinematic Universe. And thank heavens there actually feels like some semblance of gravitas to the story.But I was left with the melancholy feeling that it won't be the same knowing that T'Challa (or Boseman for that matter) will not be a part of Black Panther's future in this franchise. And that's a shame."

We knew it was going to be emotional, but it ended up having a lot more to say than I anticipated. Themes of loss, grief, legacy, are also intertwined with a story our world's history of invasion and war over the balance of power and resources. It was definitely a long film for a reason but there was a purpose to every scene. Overall this ended up being one of (if not the) heaviest and most emotional films of the MCU.Starting with the cinematography - this film was absolutely beautiful. Wakanda is as vibrant as ever and Talokan was an awesome addition as a setting. The costume design, environments, colors, character designs of the Talokan's were just stunning and some of the battle sequences were amazing to look at.The plot was very good. Expectedly, I was crying 60 seconds into the film. A tragedy sends all of our characters into mourning but the relentless looming threats forces them to hold their heads up and choose their future. Shuri is ironically and poetically thrust into a very similar heroes journey focused on revenge that her brother originally walked during Civil War. In the meantime, Namor and his people are portrayed as a sympathetic people - victims of prior invasion. The common ground they share with Wakanda is very intentional and very interesting as a plot point. Even with different cultures and ideologies, the similarities between human beings are ever present and we are all vulnerable to conflict, hatred, and greed.The performances were incredibly strong - likely because the actors were in a sense living a similar story, which is awful, but it shows and they make you feel it. Angela Bassett is just stunning and powerful as Queen Mother. Leticia Wright just makes you feel every second of her grief. And Danai Gurira absolutely shines here - I've never felt so much for Okoye. Dominique Thorne was awesome as Riri and I'm very excited to see more of Ironheart.All in all, this was a special and beautiful film. It does get a bit long and serious in the middle for a superhero movie so people may find that hard to sit with, especially upon rewatch. But I think Ryan Coogler used that time to tell an important, heart wrenching story filled with grief but also hope and shined a light of respect and legacy upon the crew's late friend, Chadwick Boseman."

I can appreciate some of the special effects in this movie, but some of the story line is just way too silly. The villain, as an example, has flapping wings on his ankles??? Come on man......seriously? Someone needs to be fired over that stupid detail. A lot of Disney movies are overplaying to that Disney youth viewer and that's ruining the true potential of these movies. Let's get back to a serious Marvel movie. I'm so glad I didn't pay to see this flick. I would have felt like it was not money well spent. It's passable, but no where close to being one of the better Marvel movies. If you are a fringe Marvel fan, I'd recommend you pass on this and spend your time elsewhere.

That the princess would not leave without her, risking herself, the hier? Yes I understand this is the nature of Wakanda but this just was a tad excessive given that this girl had nothing to do with Wakanda, except for the fact that she's a political asset since she can make Vibranium detecting machines.Secondly, the runtime was a little excessive. Nearly three hours, when so many scenes could have been cut? Pretty slow pacing throughout.Thirdly, the final fight scene was a little disappointing. Complete lack of air and underwater combat. Any fighting that could be physically intense occurred on a rectangular surface, on top of the ship, not to mention that the only purpose of the ship was to serve as a rectangle of land. There wasn't even a single shot of the inside of the ship, or it cracking or leaking. It was a literal, unrealistic brick.Fourthly, there were some pretty bad scene cuts, and the movie was pretty inconsistent at times.

Did I enjoy myself? Yeah, for the most part. I also appreciated what this film did in terms of cultural representation on another level, and looking at lingering impact of colonization from 2 different, yet shared perspectives.Now... did the film give that same hype and feeling as the first? No, it didn't for me.Depending on how you look at this film, you could walk away with 1 of 2 feelings: 1. If you see this as a sequel, it might feel a little underwhelming, but better than what you'd expect from a sequel; or 2. If you see this as an/another origin, it might actually feel pretty good and exciting (though oddly placed due to the death of Chadwick Boseman, but good nonetheless).Personally, I think not having a ""true villain"" in a superhero story is what slows this film down a bit for me. It's like watching these 2 genuinely good middle schoolers who are never in any dramas suddenly in the middle of a circle arguing/trying/being forced to fight in the cafeteria with no personal desires to want or need to fight, but have been somehow instigated to do so by a bully standing on the side VS seeing these 2 good people band together against the bully.OTHER THOUGHTS:
Highlights: The underwater visuals, the Talokanils, the opening scene at the UN, Angela Bassett's monologue, Toussaint, the ""water at the window"" scene, that LGBTQ representation, cultural representation, thematic followthrough, and Marvel Studios opening for Chadwick Boseman.Could've Been Better: The Black Panther suit, the conflict/tension, a villain, a little more background to Riri's character (to the point that I need her to have a Disney series to fill in some gaps), and the title (I remember when Michael Jackson came out with Invincible, and there was an article or conversation on TV about how naming projects in ways that can come off arrogant or too bold can lead to distaste)."

But it is also, another celebration for the African community.It accentuates the identity of Ryan Cooper as a director that wants to show the African essence in the story of the Black Panther. And for that, the movie is an another masterpiece.On the other hand, the movie also brings a new chapter, and challenge, introducing Namor and his people.It also empowers and establish the women of Wakanda, as the center roles of the country. Especially, Okoye, Nakia, Shuri and the Queen (which is portrayed under an academy performance by Angela Bassett).The film is also incredibly beautiful, arguably the most beautiful cinematography and cenografy on the Marvel movies. Additionally, capturing new traits of the people, and introducing new stories around the Vibranium ramifications, such as Riri Williams, which was presented accordingly.In my opinion the only thing that slips, on this film, is the pace of the third act, which disassociates the screenplay, and ""tries to explain many things on a short period of time"". This creates a little bit of doubt, concerning the future of Wakanda, and all the tension evoked by the events presented, throughout the World.However, overall, it's another great experience, that need to be celebrated and cherished by all."

It had way more nuance and better acting than the first. Beyond a shadow of a doubt if you put the two films side by side Wakanda is a more mature well developed film, less Marvel and in my mind that could only be a good thing.But it is still Marvel with a lot of silly stuff that does not appeal to me. Silly fight scenes, silly CGI. Actually if I was to take out the first 3 min and just start with the funeral and all those ridiculous fight scenes the film would be 8/10 based on character development, theme and how they handle Chads death. I read so many reviews prior to seeing it (and I was not going to see it) and none of the reviews were accurate. There were no issues with the exposure of the film, or anything else. And most of all I had no issue with the pace, it was not boring although a hair cut would have helped. It explored deeper political themes and minus that Iron Lady was okay. The music was not the best, I do not think the composer was the best. The costumes for Wakanda with the exception of the Queen were terrible. The costumes for the Mesoamericans were very nice.But on a political note it seems Wakanda will fight other oppressed Africans and now oppressed Brown people, everyone but a film where they just fight the real colonizers. That makes no sense, but it obviously has to be like that because the film is owned by White Americans and would be a flop if Wakanda had to fight America or france."

It's very well made but a massive budget can't deliver a good story.This movie is 30 minutes too long and it spends too much time on new characters.

For much of the runtime, there isn't really even a superhero. Of course Black Panther does return, but it is deserved and built up to. The story is mostly about various characters, even nations navigating a world now aware of Wakanda and vibranium. Sure, there is a giant cgi battle at the end (Marvel couldn't end it any other way), but the conflict is more nuanced than BP1. If the villain isn't as interesting or original as Killmonger, he is more sympathetic. His motivation is the survival of his people - not unlike Shuri. The movie is well-shot and has many creative sequences done practically (Shuri at one point seems to emerge from water completely dry; all they had to do was film her entering the water and reverse the footage). This isn't an ugly 3D-animated mess: there are people behind the camera and in front of the camera too. The cherry on top is that it pays tribute to Chadwick Boseman without objectifying his death. The movie stands on its own and yet sets up a third BP movie to be excited about, with larger stakes and flesh and blood, allegorical villains. Not another cartoon monster."

This time, our characters face an unknown foe that are apparently a water-like Mayan tribe and a threat to Wakanda. The movie also takes place in several different locations as well.I really wish I could say this sequel was absolutely amazing. But unfortunately for me, the first hour and 30 minutes or so was boring, confusing and seemed to drag. I wasn't feeling anything for the characters, it didn't seem to know what direction it was going and all I was watching was a bunch of action, (which was cool by the way). I thought it took too long until it finally got somewhere. The main villain was ok I guess. Basically an Aquaman knock-off. The last hour or so was really good though!While the this sequel is obviously not as good as the first one, it doesn't deserve to be bashed down below a 5 at all. At that point, people are just being disrespectful about it, saying because Chadwick Boseman wasn't it or because ""it focused too much on him and his death."" or because people are just looking for the attention.

While it had the usual ""Marvel humour"", the plot weaved around personal loss, despair, family bond, overcoming depression, and women empowerment. Truly unlike Marvel, the movie was subtle in emotions, and often tugged at our heartstrings reminding of what could have been, and what kind of loss we are experiencing by the untimely death of the previous Black Panther (and actor Chadwick Boseman). There were about five or six times where I genuinely shed tears.That being said, this is a superhero movie after all. So, we do have the tech-wizard Shuri along with another genius building up superhero costumes in no time. We have a great anti-hero as Namor, truly questioning whether he is right or wrong. We have our CGI fights which are very well done again (as opposed to the Avatar-like costumes the Not-Atlantic people were wearing).I know that Namor was introduced first in the comic book world, before Aquaman, and that Namor is not exactly a hero, but he did reminded me a lot of Aquaman, but in a more realistic way than the latter ever did.Most importantly, I should mention Angela Bassett's portrayal of Queen Ramonda, who, in my opinion gave an Oscar-worthy performance. The rest of the cast were impressive as well.Overall, this is a must watch movie and the best in Marvel Phase 4 after all, if not the best movie of Marvel, save it for Iron Man 1."

Oh, and it is way, way, way too long. In truth it would probably have been a passable 6/10 if it was two hours; something to catch and then quickly forget ever existed. At two hours-forty it is actually painful. I couldn't have cared less what happens to any of the characters by the end. Letitia Wright can act but she absolutely does not have the chops to carry a movie like this. Any scene at night was so dim I could barely make out what was going on.

In my humble opinion, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever takes the number one spot in Phase 4 and closes it with a heart.You gotta give it to director Ryan Coogler for continuing the story richly and excellently, which is challenging. And yet he delivers a great tribute to the late Chadwick Boseman's character. Coogler successfully pulls the audience back into the world without losing its touch while also introducing us to a new one. This movie has better writing in recent years with the 2 hours and 41 minutes runtime, they utilize all the time available perfectly for telling the subplots and why it's connected to the central conflict. And surprisingly well-done character development.This movie is also packed with solid action.As for the performance go, Tenoch Huerta as Namor is impressive, he definitely deserves this role and I need to see more of him in MCU. Letitia Wright and Angela Basset's performances are the most powerful. The cinematography, score, production, and costume design are outstanding, I'm not surprised if this movie gets nominated for an Academy award.Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is Marvel's most powerful and emotional outing to date that didn't lose its touch from the beginning to end. It serves as one of if not the greatest sequels in the MCU.Final Rating: 8.7."

Directed by Ryan Coogler and starring an ensemble cast of incredible talent, the film manages to live up to the expectations and legacy of its predecessor while also carving out its own unique space.The plot of Black Panther: Wakanda Forever picks up where the previous film left off, after the death of T'Challa, the king of Wakanda. The film explores how the nation and its people are coping with the loss, as well as how they must navigate new threats to their way of life. The themes of family, legacy, and responsibility are woven throughout the narrative, as well as the larger themes of power and what it means to be a leader.The acting and characters are top-notch, with returning cast members such as Letitia Wright as Shuri and Danai Gurira as Okoye and Angela Bassett delivering standout performances. Newcomers to the franchise, such as Michaela Coel and Tenoch Huerta, add depth and complexity to the already rich cast of characters. Their performances bring to life the emotions and struggles of the characters they portray, making the audience invest in their stories and their fates.The direction by Ryan Coogler is masterful, showcasing his ability to handle the intricate and emotional beats of the story. The film's score, cinematography, and production design work seamlessly together to create a breathtaking and immersive world that transports the audience to the fictional nation of Wakanda. The special effects are stunning, and the editing and pace keep the story moving forward while also allowing time for character development and emotional resonance.The dialog in Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is both intelligent and engaging, as characters grapple with weighty issues such as loss, grief, and the burden of leadership. The film balances these moments of reflection with thrilling action sequences that keep the audience on the edge of their seats. The tone of the movie is a balance of seriousness and levity, making it an emotional rollercoaster that will leave the audience feeling a wide range of emotions.Overall, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is a worthy successor to the original film, and a fitting tribute to the late Chadwick Boseman, who played T'Challa in the first film. It celebrates Black culture, elevates the voices of Black creators and performers, and delivers a powerful message about the importance of community, tradition, and hope. It's a movie that will make you laugh, cry, and cheer, and one that is sure to resonate with audiences for years to come."

Every movie that he's not a part of from here on out will suffer because of his untimely death. However, this movie, despite being watchable, is not a movie that I think I would want to watch through its entire run time again. I didn't hate the movie, and I have good things to say about it, but it also falls into some of the exact same Marvel trappings that they've been stuck in for a while that have had me kind of jaded with them. First, I feel that everyone gave mostly great performances in this film. A lot of attention is obviously on Angela Bassett right now (who won a Golden Globe for her performance and has received her second Oscar nomination and is expected to win) and she's fantastic, but I feel that the main standout in this movie in my opinion when she wasn't on-screen was Danai Gurira as Okoye. I thought she had the best humor in the movie and I thought she had the best individual action scenes. Letitia Wright is very good as Shuri once again, and Winston Duke as M'Baku is great to see again. Lupita Nyong'o was also wonderful in her small doses. Tenoch Huerta was fine as Namor. I had no issue with him. While I'm still on the positives of things, I also thought that this movie once again had terrific production design, and I enjoyed a lot of the exterior shots. I don't know if they actually shot all of these shots on location when they were in different parts of the world (probably not) but those parts looked nice. Great costumes as well once again. And now, I'm going to get on to the things that I don't like so much. There are two characters in this movie that I don't think really needed to be in it: Riri Williams and even less so, whoever the character was that Julia Louis-Dreyfus played. I thought the actress that played Riri Williams did a fine job but her inclusion in this film was literally for nothing except to say ""Hey, welcome to the MCU"" because she's getting a Disney+ show sometime this year. It's just a vehicle for her. The Julia Louis-Dreyfus character was in ""Black Widow"" (didn't see it) from what I've heard and even with the few scenes she had here, I found her kind of annoying and not funny. She just felt like she was written into this movie just to crowd Martin Freeman's character, despite what her job is. In Martin Freeman's introductory scene, he's out running and he's swatting a bug out of his face or what he thinks is a bug. That's how I felt about JLD's character in this. Their inclusions overall is an issue I guess you could say is why I'm tired of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, because they won't just let the movie be contained enough to focus on what they're doing. They just have to remind you that ""Hey, this is someone else that Marvel made and you're going to see them again later. It's all connected."" I don't care. Focus on what you're doing right now. Namor as a villain is honestly kind of boring and Talokan does not look nearly as cool as Wakanda. You really don't even need the comparison. It just doesn't look all that great by itself to me. And also the music in my opinion by Ludwig Goransson was a disappointment this time around. There's hardly anything that I'd want to go back and listen to later. Also, I've become aware of how awful Marvel tends to treat their visual effects artists, and it's a real shame. And I mean that for their sakes, not the films. I don't endorse it whatsoever, but I'm simply talking about the work here as it is in the finished film. I feel like once you seen one big Marvel set piece, you've seen them all now. The scene when Namor is in Wakanda felt to me like I was watching any other Marvel movie, from a visual effects standpoint. It's like it's just automatically boring now to watch some of these scenes. And they for some reason in this movie incorporated the use of slow-mo a few times. No need for that. And the battle at the end has some of the same issues too, aforementioned and these to follow. Instead of showing one main scene go on, they have to cut back and forth between two other things going on at the same time. Granted, Marvel movies are not the first to do that, but I'm honestly getting really sick of this because I just feel like I can see it coming from a mile away now. Let me see what is happening. Also, the movie like a lot of movies these days isn't long because it knows what to do with the length, but rather it's just long just to be long. I don't have a problem with long movies as long as you use your runtime well. ""The Batman"" in my mind used its runtime well. But I wasn't really into this that much, especially when Shuri was in Talokan. There are good scenes in this, and I particularly like the ending of this movie as well as the mid-credits scene. But at the end of the day this movie to me is at its best, just good to decent moments instead of ""I can't wait to see this movie again"". Watching clips online or something is a better way of experiencing it. I'm not holding the passing of Chadwick Boseman against this movie and I knew I wasn't going to like this movie as much without him being a part of it, but also I'm not so sure about the direction they went in either. They should've recast him."

That being said, the standard set by films such as Thor: Love and Thunder and Doctor Strange 2 is very low, so it did not take much for Wakanda Forever walk over the incredibly low bar. Barring Spider-man: No Way Home, this is definitely the strongest film in Phase 4 of the MCU. But it's not without its problems.On the side of good, the acting is great. All the actors are giving it their all, especially Angela Bassett as Queen Ramonda. She gives one of the strongest performances in the MCU to date. The action is pretty good for a phase 4 MCU film and the CGI is nowhere near as bad as recent MCU outings. This film also gives touching tributes to Chadwick Boseman that are definitely moving.Now, for the bad. The film is too long. There is a lot of unnecessary stuff in this film that could've been cut. Returning characters from Black Panther 1, such as Everett Ross, feel completely wasted here and have absolutely nothing to do. New character Riri Williams/Ironheart is introduced and she is just as pointless. While initially the objective of the plot, after she is introduced she gets very little to do and simply acts as a bargain-bin Iron Man. Namor as an antagonist is pretty cool, and he's given a lot more depth than previous phase 4 villains. However, he has a sudden shift in character where he suddenly wants to wage war on the surface world. This comes out of nowhere and simply exists to heighten the stakes to worldwide rather than just Wakanda. The ending also feels rushed as if the writers weren't sure how to wrap the film up and so simply end it on an anti-climactic note.Overall, Wakanda Forever, while fun and definitely stronger than most phase 4 entries, is bogged down by pointless characters, muddled motivations and weak pacing. The acting really does carry this film and while the action is fun, the film doesn't do enough to justify its own existence and runtime."

This time, our characters face an unknown foe that are apparently a water-like Mayan tribe and a threat to Wakanda. The movie also takes place in several different locations as well.I really wish I could say this sequel was absolutely amazing. But unfortunately for me, the first hour and 30 minutes or so was boring, confusing and seemed to drag. I wasn't feeling anything for the characters, it didn't seem to know what direction it was going and all I was watching was a bunch of action, (which was cool by the way). I thought it took too long until it finally got somewhere. The main villain was ok I guess. Basically an Aquaman knock-off. The last hour or so was really good though!While the this sequel is obviously not as good as the first one, it doesn't deserve to be bashed down below a 5 at all. At that point, people are just being disrespectful about it, saying because Chadwick Boseman wasn't it or because ""it focused too much on him and his death."" or because people are just looking for the attention. Then it's like what in the world did you expect to be seeing??Wakanda Forever is still worth the watch. It shows the clear message of still staying strong over the loss of leaders...."

While it had the usual ""Marvel humour"", the plot weaved around personal loss, despair, family bond, overcoming depression, and women empowerment. Truly unlike Marvel, the movie was subtle in emotions, and often tugged at our heartstrings reminding of what could have been, and what kind of loss we are experiencing by the untimely death of the previous Black Panther (and actor Chadwick Boseman). There were about five or six times where I genuinely shed tears.That being said, this is a superhero movie after all. So, we do have the tech-wizard Shuri along with another genius building up superhero costumes in no time. We have a great anti-hero as Namor, truly questioning whether he is right or wrong. We have our CGI fights which are very well done again (as opposed to the Avatar-like costumes the Not-Atlantic people were wearing).I know that Namor was introduced first in the comic book world, before Aquaman, and that Namor is not exactly a hero, but he did reminded me a lot of Aquaman, but in a more realistic way than the latter ever did.Most importantly, I should mention Angela Bassett's portrayal of Queen Ramonda, who, in my opinion gave an Oscar-worthy performance. The rest of the cast were impressive as well.Overall, this is a must watch movie and the best in Marvel Phase 4 after all, if not the best movie of Marvel, save it for Iron Man 1."

In my humble opinion, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever takes the number one spot in Phase 4 and closes it with a heart.You gotta give it to director Ryan Coogler for continuing the story richly and excellently, which is challenging. And yet he delivers a great tribute to the late Chadwick Boseman's character. Coogler successfully pulls the audience back into the world without losing its touch while also introducing us to a new one. This movie has better writing in recent years with the 2 hours and 41 minutes runtime, they utilize all the time available perfectly for telling the subplots and why it's connected to the central conflict. And surprisingly well-done character development.This movie is also packed with solid action.As for the performance go, Tenoch Huerta as Namor is impressive, he definitely deserves this role and I need to see more of him in MCU. Letitia Wright and Angela Basset's performances are the most powerful. The cinematography, score, production, and costume design are outstanding, I'm not surprised if this movie gets nominated for an Academy award.Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is Marvel's most powerful and emotional outing to date that didn't lose its touch from the beginning to end. It serves as one of if not the greatest sequels in the MCU.Final Rating: 8.7."

Directed by Ryan Coogler and starring an ensemble cast of incredible talent, the film manages to live up to the expectations and legacy of its predecessor while also carving out its own unique space.The plot of Black Panther: Wakanda Forever picks up where the previous film left off, after the death of T'Challa, the king of Wakanda. The film explores how the nation and its people are coping with the loss, as well as how they must navigate new threats to their way of life. The themes of family, legacy, and responsibility are woven throughout the narrative, as well as the larger themes of power and what it means to be a leader.The acting and characters are top-notch, with returning cast members such as Letitia Wright as Shuri and Danai Gurira as Okoye and Angela Bassett delivering standout performances. Newcomers to the franchise, such as Michaela Coel and Tenoch Huerta, add depth and complexity to the already rich cast of characters. Their performances bring to life the emotions and struggles of the characters they portray, making the audience invest in their stories and their fates.The direction by Ryan Coogler is masterful, showcasing his ability to handle the intricate and emotional beats of the story. The film's score, cinematography, and production design work seamlessly together to create a breathtaking and immersive world that transports the audience to the fictional nation of Wakanda. The special effects are stunning, and the editing and pace keep the story moving forward while also allowing time for character development and emotional resonance.The dialog in Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is both intelligent and engaging, as characters grapple with weighty issues such as loss, grief, and the burden of leadership. The film balances these moments of reflection with thrilling action sequences that keep the audience on the edge of their seats. The tone of the movie is a balance of seriousness and levity, making it an emotional rollercoaster that will leave the audience feeling a wide range of emotions.Overall, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is a worthy successor to the original film, and a fitting tribute to the late Chadwick Boseman, who played T'Challa in the first film. It celebrates Black culture, elevates the voices of Black creators and performers, and delivers a powerful message about the importance of community, tradition, and hope. It's a movie that will make you laugh, cry, and cheer, and one that is sure to resonate with audiences for years to come."

Every movie that he's not a part of from here on out will suffer because of his untimely death. However, this movie, despite being watchable, is not a movie that I think I would want to watch through its entire run time again. I didn't hate the movie, and I have good things to say about it, but it also falls into some of the exact same Marvel trappings that they've been stuck in for a while that have had me kind of jaded with them. First, I feel that everyone gave mostly great performances in this film. A lot of attention is obviously on Angela Bassett right now (who won a Golden Globe for her performance and has received her second Oscar nomination and is expected to win) and she's fantastic, but I feel that the main standout in this movie in my opinion when she wasn't on-screen was Danai Gurira as Okoye. I thought she had the best humor in the movie and I thought she had the best individual action scenes. Letitia Wright is very good as Shuri once again, and Winston Duke as M'Baku is great to see again. Lupita Nyong'o was also wonderful in her small doses. Tenoch Huerta was fine as Namor. I had no issue with him. While I'm still on the positives of things, I also thought that this movie once again had terrific production design, and I enjoyed a lot of the exterior shots. I don't know if they actually shot all of these shots on location when they were in different parts of the world (probably not) but those parts looked nice. Great costumes as well once again. And now, I'm going to get on to the things that I don't like so much. There are two characters in this movie that I don't think really needed to be in it: Riri Williams and even less so, whoever the character was that Julia Louis-Dreyfus played. I thought the actress that played Riri Williams did a fine job but her inclusion in this film was literally for nothing except to say ""Hey, welcome to the MCU"" because she's getting a Disney+ show sometime this year. It's just a vehicle for her. The Julia Louis-Dreyfus character was in ""Black Widow"" (didn't see it) from what I've heard and even with the few scenes she had here, I found her kind of annoying and not funny. She just felt like she was written into this movie just to crowd Martin Freeman's character, despite what her job is. In Martin Freeman's introductory scene, he's out running and he's swatting a bug out of his face or what he thinks is a bug. That's how I felt about JLD's character in this. Their inclusions overall is an issue I guess you could say is why I'm tired of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, because they won't just let the movie be contained enough to focus on what they're doing. They just have to remind you that ""Hey, this is someone else that Marvel made and you're going to see them again later. It's all connected."" I don't care. Focus on what you're doing right now. Namor as a villain is honestly kind of boring and Talokan does not look nearly as cool as Wakanda. You really don't even need the comparison. It just doesn't look all that great by itself to me. And also the music in my opinion by Ludwig Goransson was a disappointment this time around. There's hardly anything that I'd want to go back and listen to later. Also, I've become aware of how awful Marvel tends to treat their visual effects artists, and it's a real shame. And I mean that for their sakes, not the films. I don't endorse it whatsoever, but I'm simply talking about the work here as it is in the finished film. I feel like once you seen one big Marvel set piece, you've seen them all now. The scene when Namor is in Wakanda felt to me like I was watching any other Marvel movie, from a visual effects standpoint. It's like it's just automatically boring now to watch some of these scenes. And they for some reason in this movie incorporated the use of slow-mo a few times. No need for that. And the battle at the end has some of the same issues too, aforementioned and these to follow. Instead of showing one main scene go on, they have to cut back and forth between two other things going on at the same time. Granted, Marvel movies are not the first to do that, but I'm honestly getting really sick of this because I just feel like I can see it coming from a mile away now. Let me see what is happening. Also, the movie like a lot of movies these days isn't long because it knows what to do with the length, but rather it's just long just to be long. I don't have a problem with long movies as long as you use your runtime well. ""The Batman"" in my mind used its runtime well. But I wasn't really into this that much, especially when Shuri was in Talokan. There are good scenes in this, and I particularly like the ending of this movie as well as the mid-credits scene. But at the end of the day this movie to me is at its best, just good to decent moments instead of ""I can't wait to see this movie again"". Watching clips online or something is a better way of experiencing it. I'm not holding the passing of Chadwick Boseman against this movie and I knew I wasn't going to like this movie as much without him being a part of it, but also I'm not so sure about the direction they went in either. They should've recast him."

That being said, the standard set by films such as Thor: Love and Thunder and Doctor Strange 2 is very low, so it did not take much for Wakanda Forever walk over the incredibly low bar. Barring Spider-man: No Way Home, this is definitely the strongest film in Phase 4 of the MCU. But it's not without its problems.On the side of good, the acting is great. All the actors are giving it their all, especially Angela Bassett as Queen Ramonda. She gives one of the strongest performances in the MCU to date. The action is pretty good for a phase 4 MCU film and the CGI is nowhere near as bad as recent MCU outings. This film also gives touching tributes to Chadwick Boseman that are definitely moving.Now, for the bad. The film is too long. There is a lot of unnecessary stuff in this film that could've been cut. Returning characters from Black Panther 1, such as Everett Ross, feel completely wasted here and have absolutely nothing to do. New character Riri Williams/Ironheart is introduced and she is just as pointless. While initially the objective of the plot, after she is introduced she gets very little to do and simply acts as a bargain-bin Iron Man. Namor as an antagonist is pretty cool, and he's given a lot more depth than previous phase 4 villains. However, he has a sudden shift in character where he suddenly wants to wage war on the surface world. This comes out of nowhere and simply exists to heighten the stakes to worldwide rather than just Wakanda. The ending also feels rushed as if the writers weren't sure how to wrap the film up and so simply end it on an anti-climactic note.Overall, Wakanda Forever, while fun and definitely stronger than most phase 4 entries, is bogged down by pointless characters, muddled motivations and weak pacing. The acting really does carry this film and while the action is fun, the film doesn't do enough to justify its own existence and runtime."

All of Wakanda is struggling at the highest level to move forward in the wake of his passing, and struggling to protect their precious city from a new uprising tribe of people: the underwater kingdom of Talokan, led by Namor, ""The Feather Serpent God"".With 2:41:00 on the timer for this movie, and with built in movie intermissions a thing of the past, I'd highly suggest making your own intermissions when this movie leaves the theatres and comes to home media; I think I almost fell asleep at some points, but just managed to stay awake for it all! Phew! I was also able to follow along very well. All the chemistry between each of the main Wakandan's was very enjoyable, and the acting was splendid to see. I especially loved the performances of both Angela Bassett and Tenoch Huerta Mejia. Angela had such excellent lines to speak, and for my first time seeing Tenoch on screen, he did pretty good as Namor. Namor has a mysterious, mixed up personality, partially antiheroic, partially warm and welcoming; these personality traits seem to shift around whenever he doesn't have his way with things. It's amazing and surprising at how a little misunderstanding like the one presented here, can put Namor's people, and the Wakandan's at great odds with one another. Especially conflicted with everything that is happening is Shuri; with reality caving in on her, her own beliefs slowly being torn apart by Namor's stubborn demeanor, and with more and more of her closest loved ones sliding out of her life, we can see, with our breaths being held, that she is starting to lose hope...
With amazing action, tremendous performances, emotional weight, and a surprising, hopeful, and exciting twist ending in the mid-credit scene, Black Panther Wakanda Forever gives Phase 4 of the MCU a great and satisfying finish! Although other parts of Phase 4 slid downhill a little this time, I'm still cheering the creative staff of Marvel Studios on and telepathically sending my hope and praise to them, knowing that Phase 5 will be a brand new beginning, as we continue exploration of the bizarre and curious Multiverse (starting with Ant Man and the Wasp Quantumania)!"

The reason being? It was fantastic!As someone who isn't normally a fan of Marvel or simple action movies, I thought this was a really well done film. So much detail went into creating an alternative world, taking a lot from African cultures before they were devastated by European c0lonialism. The costumes were also well researched, culturally relevant, innovative, and beautiful.I also really appreciated the detail that went into the Talokan tribe, with many references from Mayan art and attire. My only issue with them was that after so many years of living underwater, the people could have at least evolved webbed feet and fingers by then. It didn't pull away from the movie though - that's just my sci fi nerd nitpicking.The cast was great! I like how this movie focused more on strong black women - hardly any movies do this. They produced some great fight scenes and provided some humour woven throughout the story. There were some deeper meanings behind a lot of the scenes, especially as they relate to historic and contemporary parallels of wh*te supremacy (loved it when they made the European c0lonizers kneel - great parallel to Kaepernick's activism in real life).Overall, I was never bored and enjoyed watching this movie.

I went into the theater knowing that this film would touch on Chadwick Bosemans death, but I had no idea how in depth it would go. The characters mourn the death of their king, whilst also having to fight off a new threat. In the moments between how the characters process their emotions was done amazingly. The 5 stages of grief were present, and the emotion was there and it felt like you were grieving with them. Praise needs to be given to Angela, Letitia and Danai! They have amazing performances. There was a twist in the film that I will not be spoiling that caught me off guard and saw black panther raise the stakes. The pacing of the film at times was drawn out but made up for by the multiple fast paced action scenes. I honestly can't wait to see what they do with black panther 3. The film genuinely was one of the best MCU films, the acting, the plot, the cinematography, the cgi were on point. I would highly recommend this film."

I can't imagine how hard it was for everyone in the film to come back without a lead, and most importantly, their friend. Chadwick's passing is unbelievably sad but it did leave a gap for Marcel to fill, and they could have done it so well. But they didn't.Firstly, the good. All the emotional scenes were well-scripted and well-acted, and I have to commend Angela Bassett and Letita Wright for their fantastic acting. I never cry in the cinema but this film really had me going because it felt from the heart in some scenes, and I am sure it was.I also enjoyed the costumes - wow were they beautiful. The only one I didn't like was the Midnight Angels (or whatever they were called). They didn't feel like they fit. Some of the fighting was great as per.The rest of the film felt slow, boring almost. I've just come from the cinema and I am struggling to remember much of it.The story was gaping with holes and so much was skipped over with little explanation. The beginning when T'Challa dies felt cold and rushed. That should have been the pivotal moment for the story, but it was brushed over. However, maybe it was too hard for the cast and crew to linger on.The Talokan/Atlantis story was odd to me and felt so disconnected from Wakanda. I didn't enjoy that storyline.

Some of the Marvel movies, like Ant Man, Black Panther, and the last two Spiderman have been pretty badly written movies, but they all have a pace and great action that engages the audience. This movie, by the halfway point had a weak skirmish between over matched US Soldiers and Fish People, a weak skirmish between over matched French Soldiers and Spear People, and finally a really run of the mill by-the-numbers ""We have You surrounded!"" scene where three protagonists escape US Soldiers only to face the Fish People. There is one 5 out of 10 level action fight with spears that climaxes this scene. The rest of it...the car chases, the Junior Iron man suit, the drone crashing....all of this stuff was tired lame done better before action.For 90 minutes you watch Angela Bassett overact, Julia Dreyfus badly act, Martin Freeman do nothing. Florence Kasumba does as much as she can with her one dimensional character. Letitia Wright does a pretty good job though. Dominique Thorne I can not decide...did she suck or is the character so contrived, stupid and bad that there was nothing she could do. But it is mostly hokey and horrible. Tenoch Huerta (Prince Namor), good or bad? Competent enough, but the character simply is not Sub-Mariner.And I will say this. Michael B. Jordan's departed Kilmonger is brought back to do a scene in the movie. Watch that scene..it is an example of the worst acting I've ever seen in a movie. This guy literally read his lines about at the competence level of High School Drama production. He is stunningly horrible in this scene.Mainly this is just boring. An extended African send off for the late Chad Boseman, whose tragic death clearly crippled the Black Panther franchise, followed by UN Wakandaphobia, and then Sub Mariner taking Surhi down to Atlantis (10 mintues of floating through underwater Disneyland to bad music)...which isn't Atlantis now because of the horrible mistake of re-imagining one of the oldest best Marvel characters to fit Ryan Cooglers vision of non-white supremacy and conceding 'Atlantis' to DC's Aquaman. A lot of pointless chatter, scenes of people preparing for watever. A bunch of people do bad African accents. None of the dialogue is important and much of it is cliches. Part of the problem is Shuri's character doesn't have another character to bounce her conflicts off of. It probalby should have been Ironheart, but it could have been Namor. It's a miss because the true story is her emergence as the Black Panther and we just watch it...we don't really empathize with her.The second half of the movie comes down to an attempt to recreate the Avengers Age of Ultrom climax fight scene, right down to a bunch of slo-mo co-ordinated fight choreography with all the players 'working together'. I can give credit where it is due, it finally delivers the missing action that we expect from a Marvel epic. But at no point is this battle as good as the epic fights we have seen from the Wakandans in the Avenger Movies and Black Panther 1.I also believe this movie is a bellwether. It is the first time Marvel Studios has made a mistake that Sony and Warners keep making with their Marvel and DC stories. You took one of the best Silver Age characters...Sub Mariner and you rewrote the back story to fit your director's needs. Bad Move. Namor is 'Roman' backward. He wasn't a 'meso American'. The exact thing that made Iron Man and Captain America (and teh first X-Men) work so well was the idea that all you needed to do was follow the Silver Age story. Sony wasted Dr. Doom and Silver Surfer by changing them. DC has done the same with Flash, Atom, Hawkman.I expect this is the start of the decline of Marvel. Silver Age was 1 Million Unit / Month comic books. Those charactes are iconic. Black Panther was one of them. But when you start moving into the 1970s and post that...those comic book characters never had popularity. Nobody cares about 'The Marvels', nobody is going to run out to see Iron Heart with Dom Thorne; and Shuri as Black Panther, or Anthony Mackie as a new Captain America will not have the automatic audience that the original Silver Age characters had. And as we see more efforts by more diverse directors...we are going to get less popular characters being made into movies by people who are just doing a job...they are not particularly enamored of the Comic book genre. (To his credit, Jordan Peele turned down directing one of these movies for that reason, 'Comics are not really my thing')"

It's a devastating loss, and Coogler and the rest of the cast and crew were reeling from that loss. Coogler made a genius writing choice by making the characters in Wakanda Forever go through the the exact same emotions that the actors themselves went through. All the characters in this film are struggling to come to terms with a loss that they did not expect nor do they fully understand it. In that way we immediately relate to them and are sucked into the story because we as audience and fans of Chadwick feel the exact same way. Coogler made the absolute best of an heartbreaking situation.Wakanda Forever is a geopolitical drama about loss, grief, pain, revenge, suffering and healing - all in the disguise of a blockbuster. Unbelievable performances by the entire cast. Especially Angela Basset, Letitia Wright & Tenoch Huerta. Basset portrays the role of the struggling queen, the grieving mother so believable und raw it's tour de force of acting. Wright also has to relieve every single emotion an actor can show I was completely blown away by her as I did not except that a previous supporting character could carry a movie so well. Lupita Nyong'o as usual is phenomenal, with every scene she's in she injects an extra load of charisma and life into the movie. Her presence is mesmerizing. Danai Gurira's Okoye and Dominique Thorne's Riri bring the humor and laughs to the film, and they were great.And oh boy Marvel Studios just put a new superstar on the field - Tenoch Huerta as Namor is a delight! Raw, almost mystical, full of energy and power. A worthy follow up to the amazing Killmonger. Talocan's introduction is a highlight of the movie, it may be even more fascinating than Wakanda's introduction in the first movie. So visually dazzling, creative and rich in Detail.The VFX scenes where Namor is attacking ships don't look good in parts even unfinished which I found frustrating at times especially because the rest of the movie looks so beautiful.The movie constantly thrives on the cathartic, wonderful, touching and unbelievably atmospheric directing and writing by Ryan Coogler. Ludwig Göransson's score is absolutely incredible. There's a scene in the ancestral plane, it's my favorite moment in the movie - the setup, timing, dialogue and exposition here are peak cinema. Chadwick Boseman's spirit radiates through the whole movie. Everything is build around him, his character and the legacy he left. Coogler and his team honored Chad in the most beautiful and respectful way possible. This is a movie that transcends it's medium. It something very special that will be remembered forever. Chad would be proud.Cinema."

Sure, it has a lot of potential which was set up quite nicely in the film. But I feel like the conclusion and the entire third act to be quite weak, especially the CGI (which we now know isn't the VFX studio's fault). But like I said I did enjoy the worldbuilding and the overall tone. Just that I feel it suffers from the usual fate like all the other MCU films did; great set up but a lame execution.Fast forward to this film, I was intrigued when I saw the trailer because it seems like a good set up. But I do wonder how they were going to tackle the issue of the main protagonist. On the whole set up, it is rather quite good for the most part. I enjoyed the part where Talokan and the whole sea people were introduced. I even liked the horror elements they implemented. You should be afraid of something that is unknown. I also liked the decision to change Atlantis into Talokan, and have it basically have ancient Aztec myths behind it. Very fresh and very smart to differentiate him from Aquaman. But I feel like that's about it in terms of good things that I enjoy in the film.I feel like the inclusion of Riri Williams is probably the most pointless addition to the plot. She's there basically just to promote her upcoming Disney+ series, and nothing else. Yes, she's an integral part of the plot, but by the end I feel like they could have just used Shuri for that. It's also the same problem I find in other Disney+ series (like how the ending of Falcon & Winter Soldier doesn't further the plot of the start, which makes it feel just like filler episodes).Also there tons of decisions that are pretty stupid from characters that are supposed to be very experienced (or basically immortal). And as always with MCU films, I find the third act to be rather dull and underwhelming. It set up quite nicely, only to disappoint me a bit in the end. The fights are pretty tame and lame too, compared to say the bridge scene. But hey, at least the CGI is better than the first film. The emotional scenes also failed to tug at my heartstrings, if compared to No Way Home for instance. It doesn't deserveOverall, I actually prefer this film rather than the first film. And I actually like this film's overall tone rather than other MCU films which can be almost insufferable with their one-liners and jokes at every other minute. But in the end, it still suffers the same fate as other MCU films. And that's just sad."

Yet somehow Coogler has delivered the most satisfying project of Phase 4.Like its matching Phase 4 bookend, Wandavision, this is a nuanced study of grief. It's an MCU film, so of course it's also filled with humour and action. This could easily have veered into cheesy territory, but they managed to avoid that and deliver a great film. I actually enjoyed this more than the first one; the 2 hrs 41 min runtime just flew by.I do have a minor complaint about the 3D: whereas it was used to great effect in Avatar, Star Wars Ep7, and most recently Shang Chi (all were 10/10 3D), 3D doesn't work well at all in the dark, and even the well lit scenes were a random grab bag of ineffectual and just ok. Scenes where the 3d worked were generally trivial as well. Overall theatrical 3D for this film is sadly 3.0/10. For once I'm advocating watching in 2D.But the film itself is
9.5/10, A almost A+This actually makes the juvenile humour of Love & Thunder make sense: Marvel wouldn't want 2 emotionally charged films back to back, BPWF would've lost its impact.

Everything was perfect after the first Black Panther and then the movie lost its main star. How do you continue a franchise after that? Somehow, Ryan Coogler manages to do it.While its main plot is good, the story in the movie is one of the weaker aspects, particularly the first hour. It covers a lot of ground very fast and doesn't always do the best job of explaining how they got from one scene to the next.For example, in one scene Riri is arguing with Shuri and Okoye about going with them to Wakanda and the next second the three of them are at Riri's workshop so she can grab some things before she leaves with them. How did we get to that point? When did she agree? There's a couple spots like that in the first hour that jump around and it makes the movie a little harder to follow. However as I mentioned, after probably the first hour (whenever the car chase happens) I would say that issue went away.Other than this, the story was great. I love how it takes it's time to show both sides of the dilemma, showing both the views of Wakanda and Talocan so you can understand both the hero and the villian, if Namor can even be called that.Without spoiling it, they do one thing with Okoye's character in this movie that I wasn't fond of, but maybe I'll get wanted up to it in her future MCU projects.The characters are easily the strongest aspect here. Every main character has a story and a reason for being in the movie. Namor gets so much detail that I was honestly suprised by it. Shuri grows as a character more in 1 movie than we see a lot of MCU characters grow in 3. She's no longer stuck in the ""smart black girl"" trope (even though they kind of threw Riri into it) and becomes her own. Nakia and M'Baku don't have much growth in this movie, but you can still feel the impact their presence has in it.The CGI was a mixed bag of good and bad. Visually everything looked good, Talocan was stunning and Wakanda remains beautiful. However, Ironheart's 2nd armor never looked good and the green screen during Talocan's attack on Wakanda was very noticeable. Some of the new Black Panther's CGI was off as well, but I think that was mainly due to the actions she has to pull off are unrealistic to begin with. Regardless of this, more often than not the CGI looked good, and even when it didn't hold up the visuals still pulled it through.The music was fantastic. I usually hate movies using songs with actual lyrics as their soundtrack because 90% of the time it doesnt fit the scene it's in and drags the emotions down. However, I felt the songs used in Wakanda Forever actually lifted the scenes up. The score by Ludwig was perfection, implementing Mayan and African vibes in such a melodic way.The action scenes were somewhat disappointing. They were very choppy so you couldn't easily keep track of what you were seeing. I dont think they even give you 1 good look at Riri's 1st Ironheart armor.I especially loved the ending scene. It does something I wish more MCU films would do which is ending the movie with raw emotion. As the stylized credits were rolling I was feeling my sadness and it was great.Overall, Wakanda Forever isn't better than the first Black Panther, but it does more than enough to live up to its legacy, even if there are a few flaws along the way."

A phase that divided i would say Marvel fana. This Black Panther is very different since Chadwick Boseman was absent. I would say that this movie was a challenge for Marvel. Beyond they had to do everything good to honor Chadwick, creating a film without your protagonist who has been loved by the audience all these years, but also to manage the character for the future of the MCU is just as challenging to do. I believe they succeeded to a satisfactory grade Phase 4 ended in a pretty good way.First the movie contains a lot of action. More than all the recent Marvel movies. From the very first scene, while I was waiting for the intro to drop, it starts full force. It immediately draws you into the plot.The effects were very impressive. Ok Marvel has us used to strong CGI (with the exception of some recent projects) and effects but really in this particular movie for me it was awesome as well as the fight scenes.As for the cast. I think the lead Letitia Wright ( Shuri ) had a very difficult task. This particular film was a special case for her. Because she was not called to simply embody Shuri. She had to capture through her role her sadness for the loss of not only her cinematography brother Ta Chala but especially Chadwick and pass it on to the viewer as intensely as possible. He tried to give it his all because it is not about a death of an MCU character but a real death of a loved and very talented actor like Chadwick. Especially when the film is dedicated to him. And I think he responded perfectly, as did the rest of the actors.Finally, regarding the passage of Iron Heart, I personally am waiting for her series very much after her appearance in the film. Namor is an interesting character
The credit scene is very interesting.I'm not saying it's a perfect one. It has some problems but is a very very good marvel movie."

For the idea behind the comics themselves is smart and underrated. It is sometimes dismissed as just a token diversity attempt, a lazy attempt at inclusion. The same way they make a supergirl for superman and such. However, the Wakanda setting is well thought of and adds a sociopolitical commentary that is philosophical rich. In the context of postcolonialism it uses it's fantastical world as a thought experiment. Asking the question of what would have happened if there was a secret African nation hidden from the world that is more advanced technologically and socially than any Western power. Should they use this power to unite disenfranchised and marginalized Africans around the world making a new world power? Should they share their technology and resources with the rest of the world given the history of colonization and imperialism. However, the most prominent question is the matter of vengeance, if these hidden nations had the power to destroy and subjugate the previous imperial powers, should they exact this revenge?In this movie, however, it just feels like nothing is particularly added in terms of concept, but only a new kind of Wakanda based on a hidden Mayan civilization rather than an African one. This Mayan civilization is hidden in an Atlantis like fashion with the inhabitants taking a transhuman form that is more fitting with their new aquatic lives. The leader of this civilization wants to exact vengeance on the entire world of surface dwellers and wants Wakanda as an ally rather than as an enemy. The plot itself is filled with cliches and still very much feels like a superhero blockbuster.What really carries the movie is the costume design, aesthetic elements, architecture, etc. The movie is filled with beautiful scenes and is really rich in terms of trying to capture the cultures and historical heritage it is trying to present through this fictional hidden civilization.In terms of entertainment the movie is not as funny and the action not as captivating as the first movie. Some of the battles are unrealistic and feel unnatural. I would still recommend this movie to lovers of the Marvel Universe and the superhero genre in general."

This movie perfectly memorializes Chadwick Boseman and allows his memory to live on. It is a true testament to his character and his hard work and perseverance, and you can really see how much he affected the set, tone, and cast of this movie.

Speaking of the end, there is a nice little surprise for everyone!

Not surprising for most, the film includes many references to King T'Challa's death and the impact it has on the Royal family, Wakanda and globally.There is a great amount of depth within the characters because so much of the film is surrounding the death of the Black Panther; this bodes well for the character development of many of the more secondary characters from the original film.The introduction of the underwater world, Talocan, was done extremely well. Not only was Talocan visually stunning, the story behind the city wasn't rushed and tied into Mesoamerica and Aztec culture similarly the introduction of Wakana in the original film. The costume and production design succeeded in what other underwater worlds were unable to do (cough Aquaman)! Shout out to Ruth E. Carter and Hannah Beachler for their outstanding work!The stand out in this movie for me is Tenoch Huerta whom plays Namor, the ruler of the underwater kingdom.

I was very curious to see how the people at Marvel as well as the actors were going to tackle the sudden loss of our beloved Chadwick Boseman, may he rest in peace. I'm happy to say they did a phenomenal job to honor both Chadwick Boseman as King T'challa.From a story point of view, I loved this movie even more then the first. Though Chadwick Boseman leaves behind a hole in the heart of the story, he's still there with us. His legacy, both that of him as his character - as well as his presence is constantly felt throughout the movie. I truly believe that this is the way Chadwick would've wanted this movie to be as well.Letitia Wright did a phenomenal job despite the sad circumstances. She managed to take her emotions and blend that into an incredible acting performance, which felt real because it was real. Just like it is for 'Shuri', the events that have happened are upsetting, depressing and unbelievable - just like what has happened to Boseman. But just like it did for her in the movie, this story really helped me truly accept the losses of an awesome character and an incredible human being.All of the other cast members managed to really up their game as well, leaving us with only pristine performances. I was very satisfied with Tenoch Huerta's portrayal of 'Namor', our antagonist. He was quite intidimating and his presence/power was felt throughout the movie, since it has been so strongly established that Wakanda is the most powerful nation in the world - and he managed to make them have a run for their money. The concept of their two powerful nations colliding because of the mistakes of others, is meaningful and suspenseful to watch.I adored the music, both Ludwig Göransson's score as well as the features. It captures the right emotion or vibe (loss, action, evil, hope, vengeance, ...) just perfectly well to bring us even closer to that moment. Ryan Coogler crushed it once more as well as director and lead writer of the story. I hope he gets recognized more and proceeds to make many more amazing projects.The cinematography and world building was, once again, incredible. The sight of Wakanda will never get old. Namor's city also looked incredibly unique, though it reminded me of Atlantis but that was to be expected.It was an emotional rollercoaster with gut wrenching action sequences, powerful emotional moments and a way for us to heal. I will forever miss Chadwick as ""The Black Panther"", as he will remain that forever in my heart. I like to think that if he could see this film from above, he would be smiling. Just as I and all the other fans that were sitting besides me in the theater and all across the world."

Deep fake him for the rest of his MCU appearances?This sequel was a great tribute to Chadwick. A great sequel overall. And for me personally, I might prefer it based mostly around the villain(s).There were a lot of unfair comments based around the actor playing Namor before anyone actually got to see him portray the character. Mostly based around his looks. In my opinion, he did a great job at portraying this character; you could empathise with him and his people, whilst they also came across as very intimidating and pretty spooky at times. Also Namor is actually very easy on the eyes if I do say so myself 😌Riri Williams didn't irk the way people made her out she would, obviously basing their initial opinions on the comic version of her which is fair.

I think that for some, these differences will turn them off, but I absolutely loved it.

The story is childish yet gory, the acting is mediocre, but action and visuals are pretty good. The thinly (if at all) veiled central theme appears to be the promotion of a race-based alliance against colonial powers, though its tribal and militaristic approach makes the message simply threatening rather than serving as a true counter-narrative to centuries-long wrongdoing.

And as almost everyone is tired of superhero movies being released almost monthly, my expectations were kind of low, I think I wouldn't watch this film in a theatre if Angela Bassett was not at the predictions for best supporting actress. And if she's nominated it won't be an absurd.But the main girl here is Letitia Wright. I disagree with her thoughts, but I have no antipathy for here due to them. She's incredible here, I felt all her emotions, her self-guilt, her constant mourn, she is devasted. Her arc is incredible, and she is, BY FAR, the best female protagonist in the MCU. I liked Dominique Thorne but her best is still to come; Danai Gurira and Lupita Nyong'o are back again, both as imposing as usual; and Winston Duke is, again, as funny as usual.Duke is funny, but the film in general is not, and this is not a critic. I loved to see a more serious film in a universe where some movies have drowned in jokes badly placed. Ryan Coogler, as Jon Watts did in ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"", allows the sad moments to breathe, they're never interrupted by a joke or something, the audience can feel the importance of those moments.Tenoch Huerta is excellent, not at the same level as Michael B. Jordan in the first movie (again, it's quite impossible), but threatening. His people, Talokan, in a first moment reminded me of Avatar, but they have their own design, they're not generic, Marvel is not trying to copy James Cameron or Aquaman. Namor's motivations and decisions, both make sense, he's by far MCU's best villain since Thanos.The only problem I had was the notorious use of the chroma key, because there's a considerable number of times when the characters are on the first plan and the second plan is totally unfocused, accusing the use of the green screen. That's when you see how much this project was affected by the pandemic.Not only by the pandemic, but mainly by the loss of its star. Chadwick Boseman would be proud of what his fellow colleagues did to him here. They knew the strength of his character, they were respectful with him the whole time, and they knew exactly how to move on. Every time he's mentioned I had goosebumps, and there's a specific moment that can be top 5 of the entire Marvel history (if you watch you'll know).""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" should be taken as an example on how to make a tribute film. It celebrates the person who has gone but doesn't anchor itself to her. It's courageous, ambitious, and made with heart."

Jordan and the late Chadwick Boseman stole the show in the first Black Panther, every cast member in this sequel delivers an amazing performance.Letitia Wright in the main role delivers the most range, from grief to fury, far from the cocky savant in other Marvel movies.Angela Basset is supposed to be a queen, but amps it up to Goddess.Danai Gurira takes haughty warrior to the next level, and navigates it through a fairly dramatic arc.The less-melanin-endowed - Tenoch Huerta, Martin Freeman, and Julia Louis-Dreyfus - also bring their a-game, dropping lines like bombs throughout.Everyone has so much swagger that those with slightly less screen time, like Winston Duke, Dominique Thorne, and Lupita Nyong'o are drowned out or do not get the development they deserve.There are so many important characters that some disappear for big chunks of the film. Wakanda Forever, at 2 hours 40 minutes could have been 2 films, though I was never bored.It's a pity that the great performances are poorly supported by forgettable dialogue and clumsy plotting.Even with that handicap, the actors go beyond having chemistry to be more like pieces of flint striking each other and giving off sparks. The tension is picked up by decent camera work, zoom, and framing.Which brings me the worst part for me. The 2:39 extra-wide aspect ratio is best suited to wide Imax vistas, of which the movie has very few. When used on ensemble dramas, the cropping of characters becomes distractingly clear as does the empty space to the sides. (I kept checking my TV settings to see if they were the problem.) It's even wrong for the battle sequences, which instead of being wide line clashes play out vertically, on tall structures or surface-to-sky.Despite these difficulties, Wakanda Forever is full of actors and characters I would love to see again.""Uhambe"" for now."

The way it beautifully weaves together the rich history of Wakanda with the introduction of the Mexican Native people adds a layer of cultural diversity that enriches the storytelling.Chadwick Boseman's memory is kept alive with grace and dignity throughout the film. His presence is felt in every scene, and it's a touching reminder of the incredible talent and legacy he left behind.The film's commitment to celebrating black and brown communities is evident in its narrative and character development. It emphasizes the importance of unity and strength when faced with adversity, and it resonates deeply.The action sequences are nothing short of spectacular, and the visual effects are a feast for the eyes. The film effortlessly combines breathtaking action with moments of genuine emotion and reflection.This is a beautiful movie continuation of the Wakandan story, and it pays homage to the character of T'Challa in a way that is both respectful and moving.In a world where representation in cinema matters, this film stands as a shining example of how storytelling can bring people together and celebrate diversity.In summary, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is not just a movie; it's a heartfelt tribute, a celebration of unity, and a brilliant addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It's a must-see film that leaves a lasting impact and a sense of hope for the future of cinema and society as a whole."

Black Panther 2 without the Black Panther is Disney Marvel's biggest folly yet. Delay and recast were the way to go with this sequel. Way too long running time to sit through a plot so boring and incoherent. So focused on current day and forgot to put the brakes on the director and writers throwing everything up the wall and using what sticks. The Namor character was so far removed from the classic origins of the old Marvel comics, he just came across as the weakest antagonist in the MCU with a poor backstory. The Shuri character is less annoying in this one than she was in the 1st Black Panther film but nevertheless, unable to carry the weight of the film. Angela Bassett was ok as the Queen. A fantastic actress that was given a poor plot and reasoning to go against the wishes of Namor that sparked the tensions and war. The Dora Milaje female warriors were even more insufferable this time round than ever before, quite frankly on this evidence, they'd beat the old Avengers and Thanos in one afternoon the way the director has amped them up with nothing more than carry shields and extendable staffs. The worst character in the film - Riri Williams aka ""Ironheart"", the teenage 19-year-old genius from the age of 3 first built her own powered Iron suit??? In this film she yet another Disney heroine with a sulky bad attitude that knows everything, a well-used and tired Disney trope at this point. The two scenes dedicated to the late great star Chadwick Boseman were exploitive at best. Of course, I understand the cast and crew wishing to pay tribute to their former cast member, but what was served just didn't hit me in the feels the way the film wishes it did. Everyone has said it already, they should've recast the Black Panther role instead of replacing him. Now the franchise has ruined itself behind the glaring fact that T'Challa is no more, again a choice that just didn't work. A very poor and disappointing film. Black Panther 2 is a mess of a film that ultimately dishonours the late star."

I'm happy to report that Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is a success. I think Ryan Coogler and his team hit a home run with Wakanda Forever by paying tribute to Chadwick Boseman and moving the story forward respectfully.I won't go into spoilers, but the movie starts with an emotional bang. Wakanda Forever builds on the great fondation that was established in the first Black Panther, a visual feast with breathtaking production design, fantastic costumes and impressive action sequences. The music from Ludwig Goransson is once again phenomenal, he creates a signature to this film that gives us the iconic sound of Wakanda while incorporing new themes for this sequel.Similar to the first film with Wakanda, there's a lot of world-building with the newly introduced Namor and the underwater world. This allows director Ryan Coogler to let his vision shine on the screen, it's spectacular to look at and the way they filmed the underwater sequences was truly astonishing. Ironically, most of superhero movies depend on their villains in order to succeed, they nailed it with Killmonger and what they did here is just as good, if not better.I don't think it's a perfect film, with a hefty runtime of 161 minutes, there are some moments that were dragging in the middle for me, but I think it was necessary for this film to be a bit longer than usual. Every character has their shining moments, Shuri is at the heart of this movie but Nakia, Okoye, M'Baku and Queen Ramonda all get their shining moments and a solid story arc that is rewarding by the end, so I don't really have an issue with the movie being this long.I have some other nitpicks that are spoiler-y, so I cannot really discuss them at the time. Everyone's motivation is clear and the main story is so engaging that I didn't really care for Marvel doing their usual ""laying the ground for the future"" stuff with certain characters (without getting into details). However, I can say that Namor was a terrific character, I absolutely love what they did with him storywise and visually. He absolutely slays during the action sequences, Tenoch Huerta is a great actor that fits the role perfectly, no surprise with the spot-on Marvel casting there.This is a movie to see on the big screen, without a doubt this is the best film the MCU has delivered in the Phase 4. The scale is epic but the film feels very intimate and personal because of what happened with Chadwick. The fact that they incorporated his passing into the story beautifully was so important & crucial. Ryan Coogler is probably the best director working for Marvel right now and I'm very excited to see what he does next after this big win.8/10."

Riri Williams is half introduced and then sort of forgotten for a while. Okoye's story starts out fine but then take a bizarre turn that really upset me.Then there's Shuri. Her arc in this movie is IDENTICAL to T'Challa's in Civil War and it's not a good rehash in anyway. They make no effort to build her into a good choice for BP, all they do is make her the only choice.I think Marvel missed a HUGE opportunity to make Ramonda the new Black Panther. She has the fighting skills as a former Dora, she's intelligent, compelling--and how incredible would it have been to see an older woman, a black woman at that, as one of the most badass superheroes in the world?

It's is well written to tie it into the future events and the past marvel movies, it definitely lacks the big moments marvel films are known for and rightly so - because this movie is all about loss and coming to terms with it. It is melodrama with an attached superhero connotation. That doesn't mean it is not entertaining, but it is definitely gonna disappoint if you walk in expecting a typical marvel film.Ryan Coogler handled the transition from what was wakanda with Chadwick Boseman, to what it is going it be. The characters were well written, well developed and every actor did their best on screen doing justice to their roles.Tenoch Huerta's Namor is not your average marvel anti hero. There is a lot of depth to his character and I hope it is developed well as the movies go further. I especially loved the fact that they did not make the character inherently evil, which would mean the sense of urgency would hurt the soul of what this movie is trying to be.Wakanda Forever is a necessary film for both the fans and the people of wakanda in the marvel universe.

At the time of writing this, this film has a higher rating than black adam which I just cannot understand. Black adam was funny and entertaining. This film has no humor whatsoever which is a shame. So it loses points for that. For the money that was clearly spent on this film I was disappointed. The first half of the film is introducing us to army 1. We already know wakanda which is army 2. Both talk in alien languages throughout most of the film and it is hard to follow the story as a result. I feel it would have made more sense if this was played out on a completely foreign alien planet which I just pretended it was most of the film. A lot of gibberish and there is a bit of action but nothing as entertaining as black adam provided. Why does army 2 invade army 1? I don't know. Maybe this was mentioned in the gibberish that I could not understand through half the film but whatever the reason, it was just a fake reason over a fake element called.vibranium. Nothing I could really relate to. I should really give this film a lower score but there was a lot of good flying spaceships... Anyway the enemies leader called Fishman was just a complete joke, and not in a funny way. It's a flying fish man like spider man who has pigeon wings to make him fly. Like what? Check it out and you will see what I mean. He has pigeon wings to make him fly. It's hilariously stupid. So I cannot relate to why this film has such a high rating at the time of writing this review. I have liked wakanda films so far but this one was just a let down. Wakanda has been portrayed as pretty much invincible, in charge of vibranium and the most advanced technology on this planet so what could marvel do to enhance their story? Not much to be honest but this just felt like an embarrassment. So yes they create a new invading army that feels the need to invade wakanda for what reason, I still don't know. Half way through the film once the fighting actually starts I thought, ok this must be the reason for the high rating but after a 5 minute fight that leads to nothing much there is then a lot of gibberish talking again, a big outrage, a bit more talking, a bit more talking, followed by more talking. What happens to fish man? Who knows - the talking is more important at this point and fish man loses his screen time. We are now approaching the end of the film and there is still more drama, over what? Not really sure. If you are a fan of tv soap drama's this might be right up your alley but if you like action films avoid this travesty. There is 5 minutes of action at about the 90 minute mark of the film that fizzles out into nothing but drama. The wakanda council convenes to plot a plan. The final battle takes place resulting in a big water sports spectable. Nothing you would expect from a 21st century marvel fim. Maybe one of those low budget horror films where a bunch of tourists get attacked by a giant shark. You know the type of film I mean. Anyway that pretty much concludes the film and my less than impressed review. Clearly others have enjoyed this more than me. The ending actually gets worse than I have revealed in my review but I will not give away marvels glorious final twist too much. Lets's just say for a fake battle the ending was the most pathetic ending I have seen in a film in the past decade along the lines of peace is more important than war. I mean I agree with that message but this was meant to be an action film, not a lame drama."

Before I really get into my review I have to acknowledge that making this film into a masterpiece was a daunting task given the loss of Chadwick Boseman, and it's so hard to replicate how incredible the first movie was. At times I found my attention starting to drift, so there were times where I had to rewind to catch up on what I missed.The biggest hit to this film is the runtime. This movie is so loooooong. There was so much good in it, I like the backstory of Namor's people. I think we could have slimmed down several parts, like the Cambridge section, for example. The action scenes are also a downgrade for me, there's just not much in the way of memorable action.I have to praise the acting and the world building. Angela Bassett commands so many great scenes. Letitia Wright really steps up as a lead. I was hesitant going in, but she really does an impressive job. The attention to detail in both Wakanda and Talokan just blew my mind.

His mother Ramonda (Bassett) and his sister Shuri (Wright) grieve while trying to govern the kingdom effectively against outside threats ranging from general greed coming from surface nations wanting to find Vibranium and the submerged nation of Talokan who will do anything to protect their way of live. The leader of Talokan (Huerta) acts under the guise of self defense when his kingdom is breached by other surface world nations and will wage war on Wakanda unless they find the scientist responsible for the equipment used by the CIA.Putting the convoluted set up for the movie aside, this is a much more emotional ride for the MCU. Of course a large part of it comes from the tribute to Chadwick Boseman, and his portrayal of T'Challa will be missed but this allows the two Wakandan royals to give some of the most moving performances in the entire MCU. Bassett and Wright were given much more prominent roles in the film than in the first movie and they did not disappoint. I knew Bassett could deliver but I was initially worried that Wright's expanded role would not be effective because Shuri was a loveable breakout star that never had an emotional scene; but I was glad to be proven wrong.But of course this movie is not just gloom, in fact it is visually stunning especially the scenes in Talokan. And director Ryan Coogler proves he is still a thriving force behind the camera with beautifully choreographed action sequences that look like the characters know how to fight instead of just doing a dance. And while it is no where near as funny as the first movie, there are some scene stealing characters that lighten the mood, like Riri Williams (Thorne) and M'Baku (Duke), the former being a welcome addition to the world while the other makes the most of what little screen time he has. And the majority of fan favourites have returned like Okoye (Gurira), Nakia (Nyong'o), Chiot (Noah) and Ross (Freeman). However the expansion of the world makes it a little hard to give some characters well earned screen time and other characters may also lack character development.One of the biggest issues with the film is that it sets up a lot of great and impactful ideas and themes but just leaves them there. For example there are very clear parallels between the hidden Kingdom of Wakanda, and the hidden kingdom of Talokan. And both Namor and Shuri have been through similar trauma, not because of their kingdom's seclusion but because of the amount of loss they both underwent and how it turns someone into someone they're not. The themes of grief and mourning are explained well with Shuri's emotions manifesting throughout the movie, but Namor just seemed like that one kid who hated it when bullies entered his secret clubhouse without his permission. They had an opportunity to talk about the effects of colonialization and imperialism and how it would give rise to people like Namor, but just didn't.I do not want to compare this movie to the first one, mainly because I think it's unfair to Letitia Wright. But the themes of systemic racism and ambivalence of the heartland are so well represented in the character of Killmonger that the audience understood and sympathized with his upbringing. And while his actions were extreme and was very clearly the bad guy, they did not go ignored. The first Black Panther was impactful because the hero did not just settle for the status quo, T'Challa lost the moral high ground and decided to change Wakanda for the better, because of what Killmonger did. I was hoping we would get this level of nuance in Black Panther: Wakanda Forever since it was written and directed by the same man, but I don't know if he didn't because of Chadwick's death caused massive script re-writes or because he just didn't draw those lines for whatever reason. I do sympathize with the writing process, it's not easy to give people everything they were looking for, maybe I just expect more from Coogler. I don't expect the exploration of mature themes from movies like the Spiderman Home Trilogy or the Thor movies or even Black Widow, but Black Panther is different.In the end, Black Panther: Wakanda forever is one of the better installments of MCU's Phase Four. It has earned it's two hour and forty minute runtime. Ryan Coogler knows how to create visually stunning set pieces and emotionally coherent scenes, and those two things are actually improvements from the last movie. These is no shortage of likeable characters or funny moments but that is basically what we expect from a marvel movie. It is just an another marvel movie, if you were expecting another Best Picture Nominee, you might be disappointed. But if you were looking for a good end piece to the uneven quality of Phase Four, you'll be satisfied, and emotionally wrought."

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐/10I'll preface this by stating that I do NOT understand the mixed reviews. There is not one element of this that I would've done differently.This 2-hour-and-41-minute epic had me hooked from start to finish. No other Marvel property in my opinion, particularly in Phase 4, can match this level of quality, and that's in no small part due to Ryan Coogler, Angela Bassett, Letitia Wright, and the incredibly talented (not to mention gorgeous) newcomer Tenoch Huerta.The talent on display in *every single element* of this film is going to be tough to match, even from next month's Avatar: The Way of Water.Speaking of Avatar 2, they now have some SERIOUS competition in EVERY Oscar category next year, thanks to this film. I could honestly see this sweeping every category and making a strong play for Best Picture.The acting: Fantastic. Angela Bassett is magnificent. Letitia Wright is wonderful. Tenoch Huerta brings a depth to his Namor that is rare in any film, much less a Marvel one.I believe he is perhaps an even better incarnation of the already-deep Killmonger from the first film. It's hard not to see the world from his perspective at least once.The technical craft: Spectacular. I haven't wanted to visit a new world so badly (the underwater world of Talokan) since the first Black Panther sent me to Wakanda and the first Avatar sent me to Pandora. It. Is. Breathtaking.The score: Unparalleled. Ludwig Goransson has outdone himself with this. It's even better than the first film. It's my favorite score for a movie in years.The writing and direction: Masterful. Ryan Coogler deserves recognition for elevating this DRAMATICALLY above anything else offered up in Marvel's mixed-bag Phase 4. Coogler manages to make an above-par Marvel epic that has meaningful things to say about loss, grief, sisterhood, motherhood, friendship, and moving on, while also ending on a POWERFUL and prescient note about how nations should treat each other in this post-modern world we all inhabit.What else is there to say? I loved every minute of it."

The film suffers from a number of problems, including a weak story, underdeveloped characters, and inconsistent tone.The film's story is a mess. It's hard to follow what's going on, and the motivations of the characters are unclear. The film also tries to do too much, and it ends up feeling bloated and overstuffed.The characters in the film are also underdeveloped. Letitia Wright's Shuri is the only character who gets any real development, and even her arc is unsatisfying. The rest of the characters are just there, and they don't really do anything.The tone of the film is also inconsistent. The film tries to be both serious and funny, but it doesn't really succeed at either. The serious moments feel forced, and the funny moments fall flat.Overall, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is a disappointing sequel. It's a mess of a film with underdeveloped characters and an inconsistent tone. Even hardcore fans of the first film will be disappointed."

What is going on? This movie is by far the best of all the movies released in phase 4. All the rest sucked. This had a good story line, good action and amazing acting. And best of all they gave tribute to Chadwick Boseman. There were a few things things which were silly and could have been left out but all in all I think this was really good. I felt like phase 4 was a total wash out except for this movie and Wandavision series. I'm hoping going forward the MCU will step up its game and being back movies like the old ones. However this was a good start and I hope Quantmania will live up to it's expectations."

There was soooo much empty and repetitive dialogue that I often found myself nodding off. This ""villian"" reminded me of Mr Nimbus from Rick and Morty. And how many costume changes do you need for one movie? It felt like a fashion show in which the storyline was only contrived to work around the costume changes. There was also not one other marvel character in this movie, where was Iron Man? Oh I know, they were so busy ripping off the iron man suit that they couldn't have the actual Iron Man in the movie. I've got to tell you, there were so many plot holes in this movie it was laughable. Save yourself the time and money, go watch puss n boots instead."

The visuals in this movie are a work of art, period. The tone for the different settings, complemented by the choice of actors for the characters, helped produce the right atmosphere and feel for the movie. The movie starts off interesting and continues so throughout that its long runtime is never a burden on viewers. The main characters are deep each in its own right and develop nicely as the events, yet still without the need for a shrink-level analysis or reading too much into them for them to be understandable and hence appreciated in context. Tenoch Huerta's performance really shined, I believe, and casting him for the role was spot-on. I enjoyed the showing so much I thought to myself I could watch it again and this time go for the IMAX 3D version - that one should prove a treat with this movie.

Ryan Coogler did an amazing job despite the absence of the lead character T'Challa from the previous film. He also did great in showcasing Wakandan culture.There are some really great visuals but some places it was a let down.The movie has its drawbacks but all can be overseen with its engaging screenplay and amazing actions. Many new characters were properly introduced in a way by keeping its proper back story.The background score is one of the highlights of this movie, Ludwig Göransson gave an amazing score.

One of the worst storyline and screenplay. There was a lot of directorial hiccups in the movie. Some scenes were just added purely to increase movie time. No comedy, action was average, VFX average. Everything else predictable. Namor's character was great, until the climax scene. Talokan was shown nicely. A lot of useless characters with overacting overload. Just ridiculous childish storyline disappointed me. The new suits were like cartoons. The tribute to Chadwick was great. Angela basset was good in the movie. Lupita's character was rushed in both movies. I personally did not enjoy this movie. Marvel has lost its shine."

It certainly didn't deserve a stand alone film in my opinion and could have been a 3 part tv show. For comparison, I would have said this was on par with the ms marvel show as that was too very meh.I don't know if it was the directing or just the fact that the female lead just didn't have that certain wow factor. I just personally think the male leads bring more action to the game and being a man that's what I like to see.I found captain marvel was very boring too.If we consider something like Resident evil movies, I found them to very enjoyable. So, it's definitely not the fact that I don't appreciate female lead movies. Perhaps, the chosen actors for leads in majority of marvel movies just don't cut it or the producers don't demand much from them and that's where it lacks; as I imagine they'd push male actors further and get more from them.Anyway, that's my opinion. If I hadn't watched it, I wouldn't have been none the wiser."

Its introduction to the new phase was underscored by a captivating storyline, especially with the depiction of the people of Talokan. However, when it came to the undersea visuals, the comparison with James Cameron's ""Avatar"" is almost inevitable, where the latter arguably captured our hearts with its ethereal beauty. The representation of the city underwater might have felt a tad underwhelming, but I surmise this could be attributed to the narrative's stronger emphasis on Wakanda. My anticipation tells me that Talokan might soon get its own dedicated film or series, broadening the universe even further. A poignant observation for me was the portrayal of the leadership's response to Black Panther's death, which seemed to overshadow the communal emotions of Wakanda's citizens. Nevertheless, while the movie felt a bit stretched in its runtime, it undeniably sets an intriguing foundation for what's to come."

It's like they've given up trying.The ending of this film makes an entire mockery of the plot, so much so, it basically nulls everything within the previous two hours.There's no stand out characters other than maybe Angela Basset's role, the screenplay is nonsensical and the whole film lacks in the largest respect, which is to actually entertain. A yawn fest."
