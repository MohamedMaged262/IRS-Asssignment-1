The Time Variance Authority captures him and Paradox (Matthew Macfadyen) intends to destroy his universe. He escapes and recruits the worst Wolverine (Hugh Jackman).The Multiverse strikes again. My first impression is that none of this matters. There is an infinite number of everything and there is no stakes in any of this. As the movie goes on, I find some fun in Deadpool pulling references and not treating the multiverse so seriously. Then comes all the old movie versions and it's fun nostalgia. I started hoping that Deadpool would end the multiverse. If I have a vote, that's the next movie. Feige could be the big bad and Deadpool could burn down Marvel headquarters.

10,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9919558/?ref_=tturv_perm_4,Marvel Jesus,"Or is it Jesus ... Marvel? Well no pun intended either way! And no waiting for me either ... when the pre-orders started (quite late in Germany to be honest, compared to when it started in the US), I was not quick enough to get a ticket in the first week of its Imax run. So I thought I'd wait and go watch this on the second weekend ... well the last couple of days and the buzz around the movie, made me think twice! Why not watch it once now and then go again in a week or two!? Last movie I did that? Avengers Endgame - there may be a connection here you say? Well ... you are onto something.All that said, I was a fan of the movies in between - the MCU movies that is. Some more, some less, but I never disliked any of them. I know some feel differently and Deadpool will play into this - you know he will put his finger into anything (although finger putting is being done by someone else here - in a crazier way ... see the movie for more).Just the start of the movie is .. phenomenal to say the least. And I am not talking about the swearing or the action (blood/violence level = high) ... but also the fourth wall breaking! This is just amazing. And it gets even better along the way ... it may take a minute until we get to see Hugh ... but when we finally get to him, we are not getting rid of him.Then there are the cameos ... in the second Deadpool we already had some heavyweights ... and it only gets better from there. Some story related, some just for pure fun. Some really interesting callbacks ... some you may guess wrong once you see them ... especially the first big cameo ... I do not want to reveal say more, but it is just amazing and will blow the roof off ... not to mention what follows.While there is no nudity (apart from upper man body), there is a lot of action and violence! And really grim, dark over the top too. Also quite a lot of swearing ... we may have been accustomed to that kind of talk by Deadpool ... but there are other actors/characters who'll do exactly that ... be aware of that and don't blame the movie if you can't handle that.I've mentioned the cameos ... but I can't let go of how great they are! And that's the reason I will go watch it again - and probably edit my review to add stuff. I will not add any names though ... just thinking of that makes me giddy ... or whatever you would call it. Great soundtrack too.This will definitely be in my top list of the year ... you can blame Marvel and/or DC for many things I reckon ... but you can also take this movie and see there is a lot of good that has been done! I had not seen the trailer that were out ... I wanted to know as little as possible .. and I hope you could watch this with the same mindset ... and just enjoy it on every level (meta and otherwise) ... thank you Ryan, Hugh and Zack! And of course everyone else involved! You all Rock! Had to be said.Edit: watched it a second time and it did not lose any of its greatness (perceived or otherwise). I understand that audiences around the world feel the same way. And many have gone and watched this twice (last movie I did that for in cinemas? Endgame). Some critics on the other hand don't seem to get it.And that's ok, this movie was made for audiences to enjoy, not for high brow or much story behind it. That does not mean it does not go deep at times. Especially when it comes to being a love letter to 20th Century Fox and what it did for Ryan and other Marvel products.I talked about the great intro, but what I didn't know at the time: the song used by Nscync has a deeper meaning (as I alluded in the previous paragraph) ... and it has to do with the manager of the boy band and the song being the first one released after they cut ties with him. There is a documentary that came out recently, if you are interested in that. And the song chosen therefor is anything but a coincidence ... Ryan knows what he is doing.Comic book fans will see a lot of things in this they may love (costume(s) being just one of the many things) ... you can think of Feige what you want, but not many bosses allow their workers to poke so much fun at them and the work they do ... and his heart is in the right place. Same goes for Ryan of course.3D is a nice addition I reckon, especially the beginning ... after that you probably mostly won't notice it. And as always stick around for mid and end credit scenes ... though mid credit is again more of a love letter ... which as crazy and funny as the movie itself is, is really emotional. Rollercoaster ride for sure! Go watch it (if you are of a certain age and don't mind the humor of course)",Helpful,•,26,25,kosmasp,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur5876717/?ref_=tturv_usr_4_t,24-Jul-24,

9,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9924515/?ref_=tturv_perm_6,Gloriously fun and enjoyable...,"While I am not particularly much a fan of the superhero genre in general, I have to admit that I thoroughly enjoyed the 2006 ""Deadpool"" and the 2018 ""Deadpool 2"" movies. And of course I was definitely looking forward to getting to watch the 2024 ""Deadpool & Wolverine"" movie.But nothing could really have prepared me for the thrill-ride of an adventure that I was in for here. ""Deadpool & Wolverine"" totally takes the franchise to a whole new level in so many ways, and it was phenomenal entertainment from start to end.Writers Ryan Reynolds, Rhett Reese, Paul Wernick, Zeb Wells and Shawn Levy put together a fast paced, enjoyable and entertaining script and storyline. The narrative in the movie is interesting and compelling from the very first scene. The movie starts out in a high paced gear and actually never slows down, which was a rather impressive feat actually; keeping the pace up for 127 minutes straight.Needless to say that having Ryan Reynolds (as Wade Wilson/Deadpool) and Hugh Jackman (as Logan/Wolverine) together on the screen was just pure gold. It was something that I think a lot of people had been looking forward to for a very long time. And believe you me, it was well worth the wait. They carried the movie so nicely on the screen, with their banter, their clashing of heads, fighting and dialogue. It was actually so much fun to watch them getting to duke it out on the screen, both physically and verbally.In addition to Reynolds and Jackman, then ""Deadpool & Wolverine"" has an impressive cast ensemble, and there are some glorious returns of former Marvel characters, which I assume might be getting rebooted since they are in this movie. It is definitely pure gold for fans of the superhero genre, and for people whom have been watching the older Marvel movies throughout the years.The dialogue in the movie, as it was in ""Deadpool"" and ""Deadpool 2"" is hilarious. Lots of great references, puns, jokes and generally just an allround quirky feel to the movie. It is hilarious, because you get to laugh a lot in between all the action.There is an abundance of over-the-top action throughout the course of the movie, and it looks phenomenal on the screen. The action sequences are so well-choreographed and filmed that it borders on being artistic. I was really impressed with that in the movie, because it added so much to the overall enjoyment of the movie.Visually then the movie is great. The movie is just crammed with an abundance of special effects, and it looks phenomenal. And the costumes and props department also deserves a thumbs up for their creativity and what they managed to bring to the screen.""Deadpool & Wolverine"" is better than the previous two ""Deadpool"" movies, and that is definitely a feat in itself. I was blown away by director Shawn Levy's 2024 movie, and it is well-worth the cinema admission ticket. If you enjoyed the previous ""Deadpool"" movies, then you have to treat yourself this this third movie in the franchise. I will go as far as to actually saying that this is the most enjoyable and impressive superhero-themed movies I have seen to this date.My rating of ""Deadpool & Wolverine"" lands on a well-deserved nine out of ten stars.",Helpful,•,7,6,paul_haakonsen,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur22654354/?ref_=tturv_usr_6_t,27-Jul-24,

I'm not that type of person - I sat stony faced throughout Deadpool & Wolverine, despite actually 'getting' some of the references: they simply weren't funny to me. And that's not a good thing when almost the entire film consists of fan-service and self-referential quips.It took me maybe ten minutes to realise that I had made a mistake in going to see this film: the opening gore-drenched fight scene was neither exciting nor funny. And the rest of the film followed suit, as Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) teams up with Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) to prevent corrupt Time Variance Authority employee Mr. Paradox (Matthew Macfadyen) from deleting his dimension and thus terminating all of his loved ones.Over two hours of mind-numbingly repetitive cartoonish violence and utterly inane humour (I laughed just once, at the ass-slapping during the costume scene), this latest travesty from Marvel is hopefully another nail in the superhero coffin.2.5/10, rounded down to 2 for the ugly dog, who got more screen-time than a lot of the big stars.",Helpful,•,47,58,BA_Harrison,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0945066/?ref_=tturv_usr_8_t,26-Jul-24,
7,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9927521/?ref_=tturv_perm_9,Deadpool & Wolverine,"Well the ""Deadpool"" concept is now well and truly immersed in the Marvel multi-verse and I really did fear for good old ""Dead"". More of the same? Well, no actually. Ryan Reynolds has reverted more to the occasionally quite vulgar humour of the first film (2016) and allowed this trequel to focus more on the personality of this irreverent, immortal, superhero as he tries to resurrect the recently departed ""Wolverine/Logan"" (Hugh Jackman) so he can save his timeline from erasure. To do that, and thwart the comically menacing ""Paradox"" (Matthew Macfadyen), he has to face down ""Cassandra Nova"" (Emma Corrin) - who happens to be the long estranged twin sister of ""Xavier"" who presides over the void. That's a ""Mad Max"" style desert style territory where all the undesirables have been put by ""Paradox"" and his organisation over the years. Initially, there's no love lost between our two heroes. The cocky man in red lycra does not impress his new, booze-soaked and guilt-ridden buddy, but quickly they manage to align their priorities and then - well yes, you can guess the rest. Indeed, there's nothing remotely unpredictable about any of this, but what it does do is shout loudly and proudly that it knows it. It's not trying to reinvent the wheel, it's succeeding in pointing out that all of these multi-verse films that simply adjust the space/time continuum to provide a new setting for the same old stories ad characters has to stop before we (the audience) bore further of their repetitive combat cycles and nondescript plot lines. Maybe Reynolds does over-egg the smuttiness a little but there are still plenty of wry comments about the industry, product placement and the plethora of films (and actors) that have preceded it delivering same old same old. It's not forgotten to entertain us too - there are loads of action scenes and there's an amiable chemistry between two actors who are clearly on the same, suitably sarcastic, page throughout a two hours that also features a some fun cameos from the likes of Messrs. Evans, Snipes, Cavill, Favreau and Tatum to keep it moving along with an effervescence of spirit. It's a big screen essential, there's a lot of effort gone into the production that won't work so well on the telly, and I enjoyed it.",Helpful,•,3,4,CinemaSerf,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur107065132/?ref_=tturv_usr_9_t,29-Jul-24,

The storyline follows the end of existence, with Deadpool being offered a chance to die now or find a happy place to reside until the end. Instead, Deadpool escapes to another world called The Void and seeks help from old friends in the Marvel universe, and hopes to save existence and everyone in it.Directed by Shawn Levy (Free Guy), the film stars Ryan Reynolds (Van Wilder), Hugh Jackman (Logan), Dafne Keen (The Acolyte), Matthew Macfadyen (Succession), and Emma Corrin (The Crown).This was a fun rollercoaster, and you could tell everyone involved put a lot into this film. The characters were a blast to watch, the comedy was colorful, and the cameos were brilliant. There's definitely a lot to like here. The action scenes are well-executed, though a minor gripe is that some fight sequences felt repetitive, and I don't prefer CGI blood, but it is what it is. Seeing all the characters fight together was fun. They definitely had some smart twists with characters, but there were aspects of the story that worked better for me than others. I also think they could have used better villains. Hugh Jackman and Ryan Reynolds were awesome, and their bickering back and forth carries the film. They looked like they had a lot of fun making it. Leslie Uggams (Sugar Hill) killed her performance in this; she always cracks me up.

It is likely to bring the MCU back to profitability, not that it ever truly struggled that much artistically. Disney did not tone this down, it is just as violent, raunchy and otherwise delightfully offensive as the first two. There is definitely a lot of fanservice but all of it works in context and it doesn't feel like pandering. Unlike the Fox X-Men movies, no character just gets lost in the background, everyone gets strong moments. The titular duo are incredible together. This delivers a lot of what we want from the comics and the movie series that it combines.The comedy targets absolutely everyone and is constantly laugh out loud funny; everything is fair game. There's a good mix of different types of jokes, so it never risks getting stale. You never know exactly what you're going to get next. The film definitely does have some issues due to being basically several things at once, similar to Dr Strange 2 and No Way Home. Sequels to highly successful entries, trying to do specific new story lines, follow up on stuff that wasn't even hinted at in its predecessor, and deliver multiversal shenanigans. This fares better by combining these things and tying it all directly into the plot in a very natural way. The villain is quite fun.

6,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9932677/?ref_=tturv_perm_17,The equivalent of the limbo so much of its plot takes place in.,"Sporting more cameos than a bad mobile game advert (although Pedro Pascal doesn't show up here), 'Deadpool And Wolverine (2024)' is one of the most meta movies I can think of. Frankly, it's meta to the point that it doesn't actually exist... or, at least, it feels that way. It's the equivalent of the TVA-created limbo so much of its plot takes place in: a barren, out-of-time wasteland with no discernible features other than the remnants of long-forgotten Marvel movies/ universes. It exploits its audience's nostalgia, ostensibly acting as an ode to the Fox-era of Marvel but actually just parading around the carcasses of films that only the most loyal fans remember at all, let alone fondly. You don't even have to be all that cynical to see that its various cameos and callbacks are incredibly hollow, bereft of any real narrative significance. These things are designed to be recognised, rather than admired. The joy they evoke - which I'm not immune to, by the way - fades incredibly quickly because of this, and they lose even more power when they're inevitably robbed of the element of surprise (either by the inherently one-time nature of that element or, far more bafflingly, by Marvel's marketing department themselves).By assembling itself out of only the most memorable parts of previous movies' corpses, the picture lacks any real identity of its own. Its meta elements aren't used to comment on... well, anything really. It doesn't acknowledge it's a movie so it can say anything about filmmaking, nor about the relationship between audiences and the media they consume; it doesn't point out its place in Marvel's incredibly complex multiverse to do anything other than poke fun at the very things it indulges in, while also feeling just a smidge smug. Despite its vaguely satirical elements, it's all seems a little bit self-satisfied, and it panders to its audience in a way that's sort of off-putting. It takes things fans have loved about even Marvel's least successful efforts, and the running jokes they've created about said efforts, and transforms them into a shamelessly corporate currency that can be exchanged for cold hard cash. That this film has made so much money only further suggests that audiences don't care about story if they're bombarded by things they've seen before, which will in turn cause Disney to learn the wrong lessons and cram more cameos into their now-middling franchise instead of actually putting genuine effort into the stories of its individual entries.Of course, the less pessimistic version of all this is that Marvel is simply giving its fans what they want. Whether or not it's blatantly motivated by money instead of artistic merit, it's making people happy and that's all that matters. When it comes down to it, there's a lot of truth to that. However, you can please people while still telling a compelling story. I don't think we should accept a sub-par product simply because it scratches the same itch as well-written fan-fiction. To be fair, though, the picture isn't bad. Its flaws are far more relevant in retrospect, even though there's always something that stops you from becoming fully immersed in the experience. In the moment, the flick is fairy fun. It's oddly paced, sure, but it has plenty of diverting set-pieces and unashamedly colourful sets and costumes. The action is often exciting, although it doesn't make as much use of the eponymous characters' healing abilities as I'd like. It's generally fast-paced and filled with nice little moments that showcase the skills of the characters involved. Some of the larger battle scenes are a bit hard to follow because they're really busy and quite unfocused, but even these are peppered with those aforementioned satisfying character moments. The best fight, and highlight of the overall affair, is one set in a car that sees Deadpool and Wolverine tear each other up in a confined space (the utilisation of the environment in this scene is a deciding factor in its superiority over the bouts set on an entirely flat plane). The affair isn't as funny as either of its predecessors, but there are several amusing moments and a generally light tone that keeps you in fairly good spirits throughout. Annoyingly, a lot of the jokes amount to Deadpool simply saying something that the audience understands but nobody else in the scene does, resulting moments in which the characters stand around and wait for him to finish his schtick (or, at most, tell him to shut up). Furthermore, a lot of the humour - including plenty of the visual gags - relies on information only the most die hard fans will possess. Even the best cameos (which, for me, were the ones I didn't know were coming) sort of just happen and then disappear, fairly regularly being dismissed as a form of shock comedy.Although I spoke earlier about how the film has nothing going on beneath its surface, it does try to evoke some pathos from the (very basic) arcs of its two titular characters. The problem is that we've already seen both of them go through almost the exact same emotional journey, and one of those was in 'Logan (2017)' which is so much better than this on every conceivable level that it's almost embarrassing. The most saccharine moments try to cash in on an emotional connection that the picture simply hasn't taken the time to establish, so they end up feeling really false. There's very little emotionality here, despite some commendable work from the lead actors, and the earnestness of the affair is actually somewhat jarring; it doesn't gel with the typically sardonic tone you expect from Deadpool. Still, it's worth hammering home just how good Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman are here. This is definitely Reynolds' best character, and it's always a treat to see Jackman (doubly so when he's donning his iconic claws). They do exactly what they need to, making a fairly convincing double act in the process. I just wish they actually got something to sink their teeth into, that their much-awaited team-up wasn't also a multiverse movie concerned more with mining IP than building a narrative of its own. Without them, though, there's no way this would even get made, let alone be as good as it is. The supporting players all do well with what they're given, it's just that they aren't given all that much.Ultimately, the movie is generally fairly fun but undeniably rather empty. It mostly makes good use of its R rating (it's a visceral treat to see its characters tear their enemies - and each other - apart and cuss them out while they do it), even if it doesn't exactly tell a mature tale. There's a sense that it isn't really anything, other than a collection of moments designed to make you point at the screen and say ""I remember that!"", but it also works well enough as light entertainment that I won't begrudge anyone who says they truly enjoy it. Heck, I even enjoy it (even if it doesn't seem like it). I just don't know how much. It's tempting to say that it's all set up for something later down the line, but it isn't even that really. It's just this bizarre artefact that encapsulates where the movie industry is at the moment, an uncertain time where studio heads seem to be as chronically online as their franchises' most passionate fans and continue to pander in an effort to make more money. As soulless as it may be (despite the genuine care put into it by many of its creators), it is entertaining fluff with some energetic action and a couple of solid (if rather one-note) lead performances.

10,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9950426/?ref_=tturv_perm_18,Great seeing Wolverine and this Deadpool in a film together.,"I realize that they have been in a movie before, depicting the same characters, though with Deadpool he was sort of the same character. Now, however, we get to see the highly comedic version with Wolverine who is still a bit grouchy and do we see some blood spatter. So, it all was great for me as the first Deadpool we got to see how easily a Colossus can be done correctly, in the second how easily a correct Juggernaut can be and in this one, we get to see how easily it is to have Wolverine in the correct outfit! In fact, it was probably the easiest to do. So, I had a good time, have not been to the movies since The Batman and my comic book streak is alive, but I really saw this more for Ryan and Hugh. Did not care for the Marvel cinematic universe, they kind of said they did not need me as a fan anyways, but I still came to see this one because of the wacky comedy, glorious violence and the multiple cameos, so I was not disappointed.So, the story has Deadpool in a bit of a rut as he tries to do something to really shine. He tried to join the Avengers and got shot down and was told by Happy Hogan (who I am sure they wanted Tony Stark for this) to aim lower in life so Wade becomes a very bad car salesman. However, his friends throw him a birthday party that does cheer him up, and then he learns that his universe is about to become extinct.

Unfortunately, they get sent into The Void, which is like a garbage dump of people run by Charles Xavier's sister who is very eccentric. They must team with other superheroes that were tossed aside and make their way back to Wade's universe before it is destroyed!Hugh Jackman and Ryan Reynold's are great together and make this an enjoyable film. The plot is understandable, if not all that important as it is multiverse stuff, and Deadpool himself craps over the multiverse within this movie! Hugh looks great, the guy knows how to look good for his role and it will be nearly impossible to replace him with another actor, as you just associate him with it. Ryan is, of course, very funny and he just does a very good Deadpool. The villain, Nova was good as well, so crazy and kind of cute at the same time. I will not mention the other characters in this, because I do not want to spoil if for anyone, I knew of one, but more than a couple surprised me.So, this was a nice time at the movies. I suffer from severe depression so I literally cannot see films that have really depressing moments and such. This one had some serious scenes here and there, but thankfully Wade is known for his mouth so it pulls everything back into the light very quickly.

But he really doesn't, because while the movie is lighthearted, well acted, lovingly written, it is essentially a parody of everything Marvel without actually having a story or a world itself. Case in point, my wife, who has seen most of the referenced Marvel movies and series, but is not into the lore, did not like the movie and didn't laugh at most of the jokes. The end credit scenes even show a lot of old footage and behind the screen of the films that this movie is making fun of, which really feels like a good bye. ""We can't believe we pooled it off (pardon the pun), but it's probably the last one you'll see"". It felt like those scenes where old friends laugh together about the past while one of them is dying.In fact I think I got exactly why a lot of people liked the film, but felt something was off. It's not a Deadpool movie, but a Ryan Reynolds movie, in the sense that it wasn't the Deadpool character breaking the fourth wall, it was Reynolds playing himself dressed as Deadpool with a lot of actor friends. It if practically impossible to get invested in the world building because there is none. It's just bits and pieces of others. There is no fourth wall to be broken, it's all an in-joke. I guess the multiverse strikes again.Bottom line: I had a lot of fun and laughed my ass off a few times, but this film shows both the incredible power comic stories have and their greatest weakness: you mix them up long and hard enough and you can't find anything to relate to.

To try to understand why, this review will be a comparison between MCU Deadpool and the previous two amazing Fox Deadpool movies.I expected the biggest difference to be with the violence and vulgarity. Even with an R-rating, I didn't expect Disney to allow it to go all out. Luckily that's not the case. We see violence in abundance, along with crass humor and dirty jokes. The comedy comes closest to its predecessors, cracking me up multiple times. But there are several comedic attempts that don't work.The biggest difference is the story, or lack of one. It's a huge mess, more like a series of fun skits than a coherent narrative. There are a couple awesome action scenes that stand out amongst some bland ones. And while we do see some characters from the previous ones, they are barely in it, which contributes to it not feeling the same.While the first two are primarily comedies, when they get serious, you feel it. When they get emotional, you cry. And then with tears still in your eyes, you laugh. The contrast between funny and emotional is masterful. I didn't feel the serious/emotional side nearly as much in this one.Lastly, while the cameos are fun, they are not likely something that will stand the test of time. I enjoyed them, but they do feel a bit gimmicky.

Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) about Wolverine (Hugh jackman)The allure of super-hero movies is ultimately elusive to me when I try to reconstruct them the way I would a drama, comedy, or piece of art. First, like the current hit, Deadpool & Wolverine, some just don't fit the formula, for it is both a comedy and an actioner. Additionally, it has superior dialogue in the form of the 1930's screwball comedies with enough allusions to current pop culture and The Marvel Cinematic Universe to keep graduate students 100 years from now in perpetual research mode.Secondly, it has two of today's prominent actors in Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool and Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. Reynolds is a master of co-writing terse, biting dialogue while he delivers it with the finesse of, say, Cary Grant in His Girl Friday. Jackman carries as he always did guilt for his past sins and feelings of inadequacy about being a hero.However, with his buddy Deadpool, he becomes a hero, not unlike the most famous buddies of all, Butch Cassady and the Sundance Kid. Scenes here become almost always set pieces each preparing us for the next but never definitive (regeneration being a possibility in many cases). Their vulnerability is weak while they exploit the unnatural resources of their bodies and spirits to stall inevitable death.For this ""Deadpool,"" getting to another time line to survive and possibly even change history would help both to reverse the guilt they feel for inadvertently causing deaths of those closest to them, both children and lovers. Although the dialogue deserves its R rating, the sentiment is boilerplate superhero stuff: find real love, find family, find yourself.Deadpool & Wolverine is exciting summer fare for young adults and older. It's beautifully photographed, and one of its themes centers on the bromance of the two leads and the general search for love and family. Although MCU is now owned by Disney, it is unsanitized with sparkling, smutty dialogue especially pleasing to word guys like me.",Helpful,•,9,7,JohnDeSando,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1391596/?ref_=tturv_usr_24_t,31-Jul-24,

A fourth wall breaking, in-joking, buddy comedy, which bizarrely serves as a romantic finale to both the good and the terrible of defunct Fox/Marvel world.The Time Variance Authority remove Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) from his timeline and offer him a place on Earth-616, as Wilson's timeline has been slowly dying since the death of its ""anchor being"" Logan (Hugh Jackman). Using his Deadpool superhero persona, Wilson decides to save his timeline by recruiting another Logan to take his place, eventually securing a drunken failed version of him. Mr Paradox (Matthew MacFadyen) a TVA middle manager, is tired of slowly watching timelines die though and instead plans to use a device to speed up the process.It unquestionably is a case of style over substance, a rapid scattershot cavalcade of sex jokes, swearwords, references, and cameos. Occasionally, I do think that Reynolds takes the character into the realm of annoying, but I would say the majority of the time he's just about threading the needle. Jackman gets to play the straight man (in every sense) alongside the motormouth Wilson. Their fight scenes are fun, and for the most part look reasonably good, save for some dodgy CGI in the multi-Deadpool battle.Talking about the cameos is a bit too close to spoiler territory, so I'll pull away from that, but it's interesting that it finds a way to include movies that were never even made in the film. I made a special effort to avoid spoilers as much as I could going in, so some of the reveals were truly delightful to me. I would say that perhaps this offered Marvel a chance to put an end to the multiverse saga, that seems to be floundering under the weight of disgraced actors and a general sense that nothing happening in these films has consequence, if you can always pull another version of a character from the multiverse to replace the one you lost. However, the comiccon announcement seems to suggest they're embracing, rather than shying away from that.Its' a thinner and more inconsequential plot than I would have hoped for, but it's a fun ride whilst you're on it.

I feel it's tonally imbalanced in ways I don't remember the other Deadpool movies being. I had a similar feeling with Guardians of the Galaxy 3, though, and not many other people seemed to, so maybe it's just me. Maybe I'm getting on in years and find the hyperactivity - going from funny, to somber, to purportedly exciting - tiring. Maybe Deadpool was just funnier back when I was barely older than a teenager.I do think Deadpool & Wolverine has entertaining scenes, to stay a little positive. It's the way they're strung together (or barely strung together) that makes me feel a bit underwhelmed. The story it somehow both very straightforward and very convoluted, and I think something went wrong in the writer's room for this one. Maybe it's the improv (some of it funny, I'll admit) that throws the rhythm off to the point where there is no rhythm. Multiverse fatigue also plays a part, I think.But I like some ideas here. I like most of the action except for one really poorly-executed one that was just incomprehensible (the second to last big sequence, or, I could say, the biggest fight that isn't backed with a pop song).I don't feel they entirely justified bringing Wolverine back after Logan. Pointing it out doesn't make it okay, but the literalness of the opening scene was funny. Jackman is actually very good for what he's given. The couple of times he has a serious scene here, he really delivers. He's the best part of this film- the character's reintroduction feels rushed, but Jackman delivers when he's finally given some room to breathe.There were decent laughs, and not as many jokes missing as I feared. Action was mostly solid and bloody. Reynolds and Jackman have a good dynamic. Some references and callbacks were nice, some were eye-rolling.Unfortunately, you do feel the Disney overseers though. I wondered whether there wouldn't be any genuine raunch or sex scenes beyond references, and I was right. They keep making jokes about how Disney won't allow cocaine use, but it's a distraction, because what they actually won't allow sex or nudity. This thing is actually less risqué than the Austin Powers and Naked Gun movies, which might be the biggest disappointment here, considering they have milder ratings. I don't think the prudishness is in keeping with the Deadpool spirit.If you think you'll like this, you'll probably like it a little less than you hope you will, but might come away thinking it was still alright. If you don't think you'll like this, stay away; it won't convert you.

However, one night, at a raucous house party, he finds himself rounded up by soldiers working on behalf of the zany Mr. Paradox (Matthew MacFadyan), who wants to create a time shift that will wipe out Wade's universe. His only hope is to locate his old adversary, Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) whose universe suffered the same fate, and form an unstoppable fighting team.In the world of the Marvel Comics Universe, and DC Comics, which have an unstoppable grip on the box office which shows no sign of abatement, it's easy to get burnt out with the lack of distinction between them all, a mass churning out of the same thing, as long as it all pleases the fanboys. And so, Deadpool is an all the more refreshing character, an anti-hero who doesn't play by the rules, and with all the character flaws not present in traditional action heroes. And Wolverine, of the X-Men, serves as a perfect foil, and they now have a long awaited collaboration that should please those who've been waiting for it.What could have been a self indulgent, self congratulating borefest is instead quite evenly balanced, and successfully pulls off what it wants to do very well. Reynolds occupies the first half, with Deadpool's story told in reverse, and delivers the goods, with Deadpool as his wise-cracking, pop culture referencing best. Wolverine doesn't enter the proceedings until about two thirds of the way in, but when he does, they form a snappy dynamic, with Jackman injecting his grunting, volatile take on Wolverine. Support wise, MacFadyan hams it up as the mysterious villain, while there are surprise cameos from Jennifer Garner (Elektra), Wesley Snipes (Blade) and Chris Evans (Captain America), in their respective superhero roles, as well as appearances from Channing Tatum, Henry Cavill and Wunmi Mosaku.In what appears to be a farewell to the characters, director Shawn Levy has crafted a loud, fun, riotous romp that pays a more than respectful homage to its two central characters, and leaves fans, either casual or obsessive. ****",Helpful,•,2,5,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0345596/?ref_=tturv_usr_29_t,1-Aug-24,

A few thought it was merely okay. I guess what you're going to get out of this film is dependent on what you stand on the franchise and superhero films in general.If you're utterly tired of superhero films then this one doesn't offer much that's different - a supervillain wants to destroy the world and our antihero, Deadpool, must (finally!) team up with Wolverine (complete with yellow comic book costume) and save the day.And that's it. There's absolutely nothing majorly new about this film, so you could say it's merely average, unless - like me - it ticks all the boxes you're looking for in a film. Ryan Reyolds and Hugh Jackman are great actors who are perfectly cast for their retrospective roles and they play off each other perfectly. I've always wanted to see Hugh Jackman's Wolverine get the 'proper' outfit on screen and go crazy. I get that here. Personally, I loved the Marvel Cinematic Universe up until 'Phase 4' started, so a film like 'Deadpool & Wolverine' which openly mocks how the franchise has fallen is also very welcome. Finally, the cameos. I'm old enough to recall the superheroes films of the late 90s and early 2000s, so let's just say it was great to see a few 'old friends' on screen again.So I enjoyed it. If I had to offer any criticism, I'd say the opening twenty minutes did feel a little slow compared to the 'main meat' of the film. Plus a few scenes later on could probably have been trimmed. Overall, I'd take out between 10-15 minutes of the runtime to tighten it up. The main gripes I've seen online are that it's not very focused and if you dwell too much on the plot then it all falls apart. Okay, this may be true.

9,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9928056/?ref_=tturv_perm_39,A Screen Wipe for the Marvel Cinematic and TV Universe.,"Deadpool & Wolverine (3) (2024) -As we left the cinema from watching this film the first thing that my 74 year old Mother said was ""I need to watch that again!"" taking the words right out of my mouth and it wasn't even because she's a deaf old cow who probably missed most of the throwaway jokes, but because it was just so damned enjoyable. I really hope that it will be just as good when I do go back to watch it with the foreknowledge of it all.I very nearly didn't watch the Marvel films and TV series that had been released to build up to this one, having last been to the cinema to see 'Dr Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness' (2022) and not bothering to catch up in between, because I'd been so disappointed with that one.But I was glad that I did make the effort to catch up, because I certainly would have been a tiny bit lost without watching 'Loki' season 2 before this one. It wasn't absolutely essential in order to enjoy Mr Pool's adventures, because it just had such great content and so much of it, but a reminder of the work and the environment of the TVA (Time Variance Authority) was definitely a helpful jog of the memory.Because of the Deadpool's (Ryan Reynolds) hilarious fourth wall breaking it was clear that this story was taking the Mick out of the sudden influx of Multiverse storylines, whilst also utilising that same trope and doing it very well. Not only was it just a good story set in multiple universes, but it was also a great way of fixing many of the situations that had arisen as a result of so many Marvel incarnations and ""Variants"" made by different studios.Joined by Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) in an attempt to fix his own timeline, Deadpool caused havoc at the TVA and found himself banished to the void. A waste dump filled with cameos from many of my favourite Marvel films and they just kept getting better. There were twists galore as what I thought was going to be one thing turned in to something else entirely and sometimes there were just some really simple ways to save the day, especially when Peter (Rob Delaney) turned up towards the end.There were numerous action sequences, mostly fights, that could potentially have become boring if they hadn't been so darn good and so appropriate. They happened because the two volatile leads would quite clearly fight constantly and not just amongst themselves, so it wasn't just for the sake of creating massive battle scenes although that was certainly the case at some points.It culminated in a superbly epic way that only the goodness of Wolverine combined with Deadpool's nutty ways could pull off. Everything tied up in a neat bow, but still with huge potential to keep the franchise going and maybe in a new direction?As the film credits rolled there was a stream of nostalgia which I could only imagine was a way of saying thanks to what had gone before, but seemed to be clearly saying that those bits were over and new things were coming that would replace them now that Disney has taken over.It was brilliantly clever in the way that it mocked the multiverse idea, but delivered it far better than the others.I certainly haven't laughed like that for a good long while either. It also had a cracking soundtrack as was to be expected from this franchise.There were superb performances from all. I can't really mention outstanding moments without giving away too much about the surprise appearances, but it was great how they came from a more serious timeline and still managed to take the pee out of themselves as Deadpool had always done.And look out for the Easter Eggs dotted throughout. They will surely fill IMDB's trivia section with all of the fun placements and nods to so much more.I deliberately didn't watch any trailers to get the best out of it and I'm so glad I did that, because it was such a joy to behold everything brand new. I think that I would have been devastated if this one had let me down, but I can honestly say that it beat all expectations.The only reason that it didn't score higher was because it wasn't a totally original idea and there had to be other films and things beforehand to make this work as it did.899.69/1000.",Helpful,•,2,4,adamjohns-42575,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur116970440/?ref_=tturv_usr_39_t,29-Jul-24,

I was just having such a good time with 'Deadpool' on his own unleashing brilliant line after brilliant line. Then 'Wolverine' came into the picture and the film quickly lost a lot of momentum.I'll never understand what people see in the 'Wolverine' character. My only guess is that Hugh Jackman is such an incredible and charismatic actor that he was enough to make people fall in love with an otherwise boring character. And usually I would just accept that and move on. But I'm Jackman's biggest fan and he does nothing for me as 'Wolverine'.The only other gripe I have with the film is the amount of time we have to spend watching the two leads fight, despite knowing that neither one can do any harm to the other one. Sure, some of the choreography is funny and it breaks up the story a bit, but man, could they not find some way to put some stakes into it?Otherwise I had a pretty good time with this one.

10,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9928163/?ref_=tturv_perm_43,Bloody phenomenal,"Deadpool & Wolverine, directed by Shawn Levy, is an obnoxious film that stars Ryan Reynolds and is a double act already paired up in Marvel comic books. Both are self-healers, have authority issues, and have substance abuse problems. However, their differences, such as being slashed, stabbed, and punched out in close combat in a Honda minivan, give the film its juice. The film earns every last month of its 15 certificate for its gore and risque gags. Deadpool and Wolverine are flung together after the timeline of Deadpool's universe is threatened with abrupt termination by Mr. Paradox, a rogue agent of the Time Variance Authority. Since the death of the Wolverine in Deadpool's universe is a key factor in its demise, Deadpool goes multiverse-hopping for a replacement, finding the worst version - a self-loathing, drunken failure. Redemption beckons, but not before plenty of effects-driven carnage and a run-in with Cassandra, the deranged evil twin of Professor Charles Xavier. The film earns every last month of its 15 certificate for its gore and risque gags. Disney acquired 20th Century Fox in 2018 and began working on its first sequel to Deadpool, a popular R-rated Marvel character. Despite being from the Marvel label, Reynolds' character was not easily adapted into Disney's less edgy PG-13 Marvel Cinematic Universe. Six years later, the first R-rated MCU movie, Deadpool & Wolverine, was released in 2024, bringing a dream teaming for fans. The results for Deadpool & Wolverine are truly out of this world. Deadpool & Wolverine, a film directed by Shawn Levy, stars Reynolds and Hugh Jackman in a forced odd coupling, reminiscent of Godzilla vs. Kong and Midnight Run. The chemistry between the stars is evident, with Reynolds describing the film as like Fox dumped Wolverine, Disney picked him up, and Jackman ""has to play him until he is 90."" The movie is the most anticipated of the summer, proving a new future for both characters in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Reynolds' character, Wolverine, is a crackerjack quipster who constantly breaks the fourth wall, letting no one off the hook, including the studio. The jokes come at you so rapid-fire that one viewing is way too much. Levy, who co-produced and co-wrote the film, abandons his family-friendly filmography and fits comfortably into this particular universe, allowing the blue comedy to rip and the action to soar while ingesting heart and friendship into a winning mix that never seems off for a minute in the 127-minute running time.

It has not really delivered since 2021's Spiderman: No Way Home.I thought Deadpool and Wolverine would be good. I didn't expect it to be this good. It is hilarious (it's pretty much a straight up comedy) and is very R Rated, with a lot of fun action sequences. The Like A Prayer action sequence is a joy to behold. The movie not only gave me everything I wanted, but everything I didn't know I wanted. Think of it as a Buddy cop movie set in the MCU that is surprisingly emotional at times.Ryan Reynolds always knocks it out of the park as Deadpool, his non stop talking, should get annoying, but it never does, at least for me. When you see how good Hugh Jackman is here, you will want him to stick around in the MCU. I can't see any other actor, stepping into his shoes, so soon after this. If Logan was ""goodbye"", this was ""I'm back"".The cameos are not what you expect at all,but are amazing. Some of them are not even cameos, but actually service the story. They are very satisfying. There is a lot of spot on industry commentary from Reynolds, too. I think comic book readers/fans will get more out of it, as some of the jokes (especially during a montage) went over my head, but got big reactions in my screening.There is almost nothing to complain about (outside of my pet hate in Marvel movies, I'm really looking for something to complain about). Though I'm sure, some will find reasons to.There is a nice, touching BTS playing during the end credits, before an end credit scene.For me, Deadpool & Wolverine has dragged the MCU back on track. This reminded me of the early days of the MCU. My second favourite movie of the year. If this doesn't pull audiences out of superhero fatigue, nothing will. This should have huge rewatchability, so I'm expecting huge repeat business. This is the most fun you will have at the cinema, this year.

As you'd expect with Ryan Reynolds in this role, the jokes are plentiful and there is barely any time to react to one before another appears. That can sometimes not work as well as intended, e.g. 'Deadpool 2', but here the humour is executed perfectly.Reynolds himself is quality, it is a quintessential Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool performance. It's real neat to see Hugh Jackman back as Wolverine, he does play second fiddle to the other titular character but still more than holds his own, as you'd expect. Emma Corrin, meanwhile, enters the MCU with a great showing.As noted at the top, I do think the plot couldn't been superior - but not in a negative way.

Any concerns of Deadpool being watered down in his violence, profanity or fourth wall breaking nature upon entering the MCU are instantly disproven in the hilarious and gleefully violent opening scene. It's not preoccupied with saving the MCU, offering a really funny double act between two genuine friends and perfectly cast actors in a film that doesn't forget about the sincerity that completes a Deadpool film.Ryan Reynolds accomplishes a hard task of being a real motor mouth once again without becoming annoying. There's only really one joke that properly overstays it's welcome and he's still given plenty of emotional weight to work with so it doesn't feel like empty calories. Plus, his fourth wall breaks get away with a surprisingly high amount of jabs at the current state of MCU as well as helping the film to overcome the messy and convoluted plotting.Hugh Jackman's return was always going to undermine Logan in some capacity so the best case scenario is doing minimal damage to that perfect ending and that's achieved here. As well as pairing beautifully with Reynolds, Jackman's performance makes it clear that this is a very different Wolverine to any of the other's with a new arc that allows this version to get a satisfying arc over the course of the adventure.Shawn Levy's direction gets the job done. He's by no means an auteur however he is a filmmaker who's done his fair share of blockbusters and worked with Jackman & Reynolds multiple times already, so he makes sure everything keeps moving along nicely with action scenes that are mostly well constructed. The characters may be invulnerable but Levi only uses that to indulge in the gore like never before.The soundtrack has always been a major highlight of the Deadpool films and this one reaches new heights. The songs are employed a lot more than Rob Simonsen's forgettable score and the ones chosen are so good that they're able to make up for the score. Bye Bye Bye and Like a Prayer are the best by far, which is especially fitting since those two bookend the film beautifully.",Helpful,•,4,3,masonsaul,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur94560739/?ref_=tturv_usr_46_t,27-Jul-24,

[+72%],"Deadpool shoots and slices his way into the MCU in a largely fun comic-book film (after a long time, uff!) filled with great set pieces, a fantastic lead duo, one-liners galore, and a barrage of cameos (as expected). Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman were born to play Deadpool and Wolverine, respectively-their yin-yang dynamic is used in marvelous ways (pun intended) throughout. Shawn Levy, who has worked with Ryan and Hugh before (but separately), is able to extract the best out of both, making the 2h 7m run-time almost fly by. A lot of the humor is self-deprecating, fourth-wall-breaking, and taking digs at both Fox and Marvel (especially, for their recent fumbles). When you look back at it, Deadpool & Wolverine is almost like a tribute piece to all those Marvel comic-book films made in the last couple of decades, regardless of who made (or acted in) them.That is also why the film's smaller emotional beats might strike a better chord with millennials. The multiverse concept has REALLY run its course, and I'm only letting it slide because it finally brings this iconic duo together (in better circumstances - yes, I'm looking at you X:Men Origins Wolverine) alongside a few others (not going to spoil them - don't go looking for the IMDB cast list!). Considering that's the case, the plot is kinda messy, even when it offers plenty of holy hell moments. The screenplay also nearly forgets to flesh out its antagonist - Cassandra Nova (Emma Corrin) - and it does so in a hasty way as if just to have a character for the two dudes to finally take down when they're not fighting each other.There's one set piece that randomly begins inside a car, and the way it was shot, particularly stood out to me. Levy and crew also exhibit inventiveness in bringing characters from other universes and timelines, without making a giant mess of it. Every cameo (or extended cameo) is a delicious cherry atop the humongous cake, and also leaves a lot of room for further exploration - now, Disney BETTER NOT go and make 76 films and 29 TV shows already! This is a crowd-pleaser by all means, and it's gonna rake in a lot of moolah at the box office. It's not the perfect comic-book film; heck, it's not even the best Deadpool flick (the first one STILL takes the cake, for me), but what it is though, is a sumptous FEAST for all those who have grown up on a steady dose of Marvel over the years (except for, well.. the 2020s).",Helpful,•,1,1,arungeorge13,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur30872044/?ref_=tturv_usr_57_t,28-Jul-24,

Deadpool had already predicted in the PG-13 version of the second film that Disney would buy Fox and that generated certain concerns once it came true. In the end, Disney introduced Deadpool into the MCU in a worthy way adding to the X-Men franchise. With his characteristic humor and charisma, Deadpool keeps the essence of his previous films intact. He continues with his references to popular culture, breaking the fourth wall and also jokes towards gen Z. The film offers its clever gags combined with a good mix of action and comedy. The soundtrack has very good songs, including an epic version of Madonna's Like A Prayer. The X-Men were already being considered for the MCU, and the best way to start it was with Wolverine. To be honest, Wolverine has become almost the face of the X-Men saga since the first film. Hugh Jackman was brought back as an alternate version of the original Wolverine, but he retains his tough personality. The film also brings back some characters that have been seen in the X-Men saga. In addition, not only does the MCU manage to link this saga as part of the multiverse, there is also a possibility that the X-Men animated series from the 90s could also be part of this multiverse. That's because Wolverine wears the classic costume from the animated series and Gambit also appears in the same outfit he had in the series. All of that is just part of the best of this movie because the rest officially confirms what was suspected to happen after the last Spider-Man movies and the Doctor Strange sequel. The movie also features the appearance and mention of some characters from the Marvel movies that were made before the MCU started. This movie officially confirms that all the Marvel movies that were made over time are part of a multiverse. They knew how to take advantage of the theme of alternate realities very well to connect the movies and series as it happened with DC Comics in The Flash movie. That even helped a lot so that some Marvel movies that passed without pain or glory got a second chance. Deadpool & Wolverine is indisputably a great movie that revives the fascination with the multiverse and also the appreciation for Marvel's filmography even if it is out of a feeling of nostalgia. My final rating for this movie is 10/10.",Helpful,•,1,1,Elvis-Del-Valle,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur139621299/?ref_=tturv_usr_62_t,5-Aug-24,

I know Deadpool has always been an outrageous and comical character. However this film was full of random events that were forcefully pushed together. It lacked flow and I feel a massive opportunity was missed here by coupling up the most rugged character in the universe with the craziest. The humour was passable and worked now and then but it definitely wasn't as funny as I hoped it would be, given the two leads and how crazy they could have made the villain or antagonist. The villain did not even look formidable and just someone in a suit. This was another missed opportunity to have someone who could have been as formidable and hilarious as the two leads. This film would have benefited so much by borrowing the elements from Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 1 that made it so funny, logical and fun to follow at the same time.I just could not get into the this film and while people are raving about it, I honestly felt it was quite a weak mess of a film with no proper story, it was full of random and uninspired scenes and did not make as big a splash for me.

Look, I get it, I'm not a marvel guy and I agree that the gargantuan presence of the MCU languishing in cinemas for the past decade and a half has been detrimental kinda to all things 'cinema', or however you and Mr. Scorsese choose to personally word it. But as much as I'm not a marvel guy, I am a meta guy in the sense that I love self aware, fourth wall breaking storytelling and boundary pushing stuff, from Last Action Hero to Scream to Wayne's World to Roger Rabbit. Ryan Reynolds is a lot of fun in the role, clearly an ongoing passion project for him, it's like his version of The Mask where he just gets to run through walls with his naturally effervescent, joyously profane presence and bounce it off of Hugh Jackman's perennially pissed off Wolverine. Even if the multiverse malarkey makes the story almost indecipherable compared to the first two films, it's just a ride you take and sort of surrender to in all its messy, mad dog glory. And the cameos? Well, some people this the multiverse angle and all the delirious nostalgia indulgence will ruin coherency and restraint in film, but I'd be lying if a few specific characters we see here from pre-MCU Marvel flicks didn't make me feel all warm and fuzzy, and sort of long for those much simpler times in the Superhero genre.",Helpful,•,6,5,NateWatchesCoolMovies,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur18423640/?ref_=tturv_usr_64_t,7-Aug-24,

If you have seen the Deadpool movies, you know they are about fun, frenzy, and fast-paced antics that the red-clad antihero brings. Teamed up with his X-men ""buddy"". The pace is just as fierce and fun (if not more) as they go about their quest of handling the MCU/Fox merger and more. The whole thing is loaded with comedy, antics, dialogue, slapstick and more all unleashing the full comedic prowess of Deadpool that is still in your face, but curtailed with the rugged bluntness of Wolverine. Reynolds and his team of writers, alongside Levy's direction, read the Internet, the movie problems, and wrapped the tale into nearly 130 minutes of hilarity I've been missing in superhero movies. They poke fun at everything, willing to cross the lines in true Deadpool fashion to leave this love letter to everyone in that charismatic way. It's loaded to the nines with references to so many aspects of Marvel movies and for fans/geeks like me, I enjoyed finding everything I could from the comics, movies, and more (alongside the jabs that were being thrown with it).Yet, the movie is not just about the comedy and stammering lines Reynolds has proven a master at crafting. Deadpool and Wolverine have still more surprises and mastery to give you more to this film for fans to enjoy. The soundtrack is still incredible, surpassing so many of the other movies not just in variety, but the use of these songs in ways that most would shy away from adding that fresh factor people seem to crave. The movie is eighty percent buddy-hero comedy, yet it still holds some of Marvel sentimentality to give our two guys some heart and depth that serves to ground some of the exploits that marrie an okay story without impeding on the Deadpool schtick. And the action proves with the right amount of planning, studying, and potentially removing some of the ""violence"" limits, you can create some of the best fight sequences that somehow stand out in the Marvel Universe. Even the end credits have this iconic balance, not elevating the story, but doing something better that plays right to the strengths of our two leads. And while a lot of this is on the writing, direction, and design team, I have to give it to the two leads for giving it their all to make this movie what it is as well. Corrin's billing deserves a nod, playing her role with the same gravitas as another Marvel counterpart, and injecting other elements that make such a fascinating piece to this complex puzzle. Jackman comes back to Wolverine and seems to have not skipped a beat in the rugged antihero ready to claw his way back to the universe. He's a perfect Yin to Ryan's Yang, crafting this straight-to-the-point, concise, no-nonsense attitude that helps to shut the mercenary up when needed. And Reynolds has pretty much never left the character, only this time bringing even more fire to the role as his character has permission to rebel against the very trends the studios conjure up. Together, the two make this dance of dynamic, dastardly, derogative deeds that remained entertaining the whole way through and was a pair-up that I am very happy to have witnessed.DISLIKES:Plot Is Not The StrongestSuper Violet/Aggressive/CrudeSometimes Too StupidMore Time Needed For Some AspectsVery Reference And Other Series HeavySo many Characters That I Wanted More Time/DevelopmentSUMMARY:
The film is incredible on many accounts, but there are going to be some things to mention that might be considered warnings/dislikes depending on your personal feelings. For one, the plot is not the strongest. While certainly not the worst thing to be put together/recrafted, the third installment has a tale that tries to be deep, but comes off as weird, inconsistent, and kind of pointless given everything else happening in the universe. Those hoping it's going to give you full-on glimpses into the direction of the coming Marvel Phases, or looking for that respect towards an arc that will blow your mind need to lower the expectations now. In standing on its own, the self-contained tale is enjoyable, but I can also appreciate the desire to get Marvel back on a fun plot that made Phases 1-3 so enjoyable. My friend and I agreed as well that Deadpool's excessiveness can be hard to swallow, and the third installment doesn't buffer much in the ways of violence and crude displays of debauchery. Those with sensitive ears, sensitivity to very vulgar language, and stomachs not attuned to bloody violence will need to stay away from this movie and the red that essentially floods the screen at all times. In addition, any who don't tolerate ludicrous levels of silliness, ridiculous asides, and banter that could match any monologue fifty times over, should sit this one out. I agree the excess gets a tad much for me at times, but the variety this film brought distracted me from it enough for this to be less of a dislike than it could have been. Where tapering could have been a boon was in curtailing the antics so that we might get more time with characters and stories. Deadpool has a lot of characters who play pieces given everything this film pulls from, and two hours did not give remotely enough time to get the most out of them. Did they serve their purpose and have memorable moments? Sure, but there was so much that could have been done, primarily with Cassio's character. I can't say too much as that would be spoiling. My friend also did not enjoy how reference-heavy the movie was, and I can agree that, unlike other installments, this movie leans very heavily on a lot of cultural knowledge for this very convoluted plot. Again, no spoilers, but fans who know about the politics behind the movies, the pre-MCU days of the franchise, and Deadpool's other films (alongside heavy comic references) will thrive the most, while others may be overwhelmed, confused, and bored by the comedic directions this film takes at some point. Fortunately, Deadpool & Wolverine have enough to mitigate this, but again a limitation for the overall audiences.THE VERDICT:
Deadpool & Wolverine had a lot of things to accomplish, and for this reviewer... they certainly achieved much of what I wanted. Overall, the movie is fun and a solid entry into the Merc With a Mouth's installments that excels at so much of what makes Deadpool his signature anti-hero. The comedy alone is enough to lavish over this movie, but the wit, the action, the surprising heart at times, and the acting make this movie fun. It takes the elements of the MCU I enjoyed in the past, but yet puts that modern twist to defend against the trends and Internet to make a movie that isn't hindered by the world's current preferences. And to give me action and comedy, with some drama, looped in, is a success that a reviewer/fan like me can get on board with. However, it is still excessive, and Deadpool's darker plot lines and gimmicks are more NC-17 than R in the ratings department. Those not ready for the gore, cursing, crude dialogue, and darker elements will not enjoy a film of this caliber, nor will those looking for the advancement of the MCU and X-men franchises that we still await in 2025. It also tries to do so much in a little time and relies heavily on one's knowledge of a lot of things to fully appreciate this homage to the Marvel empire. While fans like me will revel in delight, others without the knowledge may find themselves bored or confused to the level of disliking this movie compared to the other Deadpool entries. From all this, my scores are:Buddy Comedy/Superhero/Action/Adventure/Comedy/Sci-Fi: 8.5

The third film Deadpool & Wolverine (2024) was incredibly fun and funny to watch with excellent performances, fun action sequences, awesome fan service, entertaining cameos, an intimidating villain, great humor involving fourth wall breaks and jokes about the Marvel Cinematic Universe, a fantastic opening credit sequence, and a satisfying goodbye to the Twentieth Century Fox era of comic book films; while watching the movie you can tell that Ryan Reynolds wanted to make a great film, and the film respects the events that occurred in the film Logan (2017) in its own funny and entertaining way.Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman are fantastic together as Deadpool/Wade Wilson and Wolverine/Logan, with one being the straight man in a way and the other is known for being loudmouth and annoying, that dynamic between them was great and funny to watch from beginning to end; Deadpool/Wade Wilson was once again hilarious with him doing great fourth wall breaks, but also him being introduced to the Marvel Cinematic Universe by the TVA and trying to save his world was investing and entertaining to watch. It is awesome seeing Hugh Jackman play Wolverine/Logan again, it was cool knowing he is a variant of Wolverine with him having a tragic backstory and an awesome comic accurate yellow and blue outfit; he was funny in that powerful way with him and Deadpool fighting each other or trying to fix his own world, but also, that there is a whole monologue from him in the film that was very effective. Lastly, other than some little appearances from other characters from the other Deadpool films, I will say that I like how they use the TVA to bring Deadpool into the MCU despite Deadpool doing his own way to save his world and ignore everything the TVA says about these multiple worlds; also, there is a character who was funny but acted like an antagonist in some way.The villain of the film is Charles Xavier's sister Cassandra Nova, played very well by Emma Corrin, who was an intimidating character, but she was also smart while having these powers that at times made her seem overpowered, but it worked with what the film is; she did not have much of an explanation, but what I got was that she wanted to take control of all worlds. The action sequences were amazing and funny to watch, with them all being well shot and the fights between Deadpool and Wolverine were great to watch, it especially worked because of the R rating; there was so much fun action, and the film was beginning to end because of the jokes and fourth wall breaks; this also leads to the film having variants of certain characters, lots of cameos, and an excellent opening credits sequence at the start of the film. Lastly, this film has lots of stuff fans will recognize from the comics, with the multiple cameos, variants, comic exact moments, and comic exact characters that are amazing to see; the film was entertaining, funny, and fun from beginning to end, especially for comic book fans.The third film Deadpool & Wolverine (2024) was incredibly fun and funny to watch with excellent performances, fun action sequences, awesome fan service, entertaining cameos, an intimidating villain, great humor involving fourth wall breaks and jokes about the Marvel Cinematic Universe, a fantastic opening credit sequence, and a satisfying goodbye to the Twentieth Century Fox era of comic book films; you can tell that Ryan Reynolds loved this character and that he wanted to make a great film, and the film respects the events that occurred in the film Logan (2017) in its own funny and entertaining way. This was a satisfying goodbye to the Twentieth Century Fox era for superhero films, with it also being a great introduction to the Marvel Cinematic Universe for the Deadpool character, along with it being a great third film in the Deadpool film series; if this is going to be the last appearance for the character of Deadpool, then Ryan Reynolds made an excellent trilogy of films thar are fun, funny, and very entertaining to watch and rewatch.",Helpful,•,2,2,MB-reviewer185,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur118439842/?ref_=tturv_usr_66_t,22-Aug-24,

Trying to keep up with all these shows and characters and timelines is starting to become a bit of a chore. But this is one of the few post Endgame MCU instalments where I've gone to the theatre out of excitement rather than obligation in the hopes this would inject some much needed life into the franchise. And boy does it.If you've seen a Deadpool movie you'll know what to expect from this film. It is violent, lewd, bloody, and hilarious. The fourth wall breaks go even further than they have before to great effect. It pokes the right amount of fun out of the MCU whilst also showing plenty of love for Marvel through some surprising cameos. The action scenes are thoroughly entertaining and truly vicious at times.The introduction of Wolverine is very effective. It's not necessarily as emotional of an arc as I was expecting based on the trailer and what I'd read in interviews but it still works perfectly well. Seeing Hugh Jackman back in the role and adopting the iconic suit is just a whole lot of fun, especially now that he can fully let rip in this R rated version. Ryan Reynolds is terrific in a role he was born to play. He's just hilarious as Deadpool and you can tell he just connects with and understands the character to tremendous effect. The off screen friendship between the two carries through to their on screen chemistry which is hugely entertaining.My only criticism is that the core of the story is kind of bog standard and nothing too intriguing. Additionally, as is the case with a lot of movies, they don't really know what to do with their villain. Emma Corrin puts in a good performance so this is no criticism to them, but it's just not a particularly fleshed out or impacting villain to get stuck into.This is really a minor criticism of an otherwise hugely entertaining film.

And Ryan Reynolds knows fully well he can do whatever the heck he feels like doing because Deadpool is THAT self-aware and refreshing a character who doesn't spare anyone the mercy of mockery.The MCU is certainly in need of some creative revitalising and the film runs with that too; it does this and reveres the Fox-era X-Men films against a narrative backdrop that ACTUALLY does justice to the whole 'vs' concept of a crossover film where two icons fight to the 'death'. Deadpool & Wolverine works because it does what films like Batman v Superman and the Alien vs Predator films failed to realise: being uncomplicated upfront FUN, playing to the strengths of their characters.Deadpool & Wolverine is simply good fun at the movies, and it's what the MCU needs instead of being a constant barrage of sequel-bait material. Yes we like sequels, but they still have to be earned all the same.Deadpool & Wolverine gets 4/5 stars. 8/10 IMDbs. It's the kind of self-contained fun movies strive to be.

Even here when it deals with the multiverse and being the sequel to the Deadpool movies, it still managed to give me that. It also helped that it's filled with cameos of pre-MCU Marvel characters that I grew up with. It was so much fun to see all those cameos and also the fact that everyone had actually something to do rather than just appear out of nowhere. The surprises with some aspects of the cameos were also incredible to watch with a great responsive crowd. That one surprise cameo was really unexpected for me since I had dismissed it as fans going overboard when I first heard about it months ago.The buddy action movie template with a multiversal stake around it worked pretty well as a fun-filled entertainer without having to think much about it. Even though some expositions felt a bit not so creative, they intentionally did it so that anyone could enjoy it even if they weren't aware of the innumerable references, easter eggs and cameos.Hugh Jackman is still such a fantastic Wolverine, giving depth to a weakly written character just using his face. Emma Corrin also surprised me by giving a strong performance, acting against these guys, again with a one-dimensional character.I also loved how this ended up basically a tribute to the pre-MCU Marvel movies, specifically the 20th Century Fox Marvel movies. I was a fan of all those superhero movies growing up. A lot of people didn't really care about such movies until Infinity War came out. And they are the first to cry about how after Endgame, it's not the same. But to me, it's these movies from the 2000s that gave the base for the MCU. There are just so many dialogues in this movie referencing those older movies that I just love to see the respect given to them.Suffice to say, I loved this movie more than the previous Deadpool movies.",Helpful,•,3,2,Jithindurden,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur46647047/?ref_=tturv_usr_79_t,26-Jul-24,

Lack of flashbacks: 1I did have fun with it, but it's not really a top movie. Mainly a few factors bring it down. It overuses slowmotion to a fault. Time and time again we see those huge entrances with the main characters do a slow walk. And we constantly see flashbacks in scenes that otherwise feel well-paced. Then of course there is the acting dud in the female Professor X. Weirdly her scenes have horrible editing and camera work. Did they plaster her into the movie in reshoots? Lucky most here is still fun despite the 4th wall break most often just feeling lame. The male bad guy for example is great. Just a whining genius. Wolverine is the best we have ever seen him with acting way above what this movie demands. Everyone else is phoning it in as they should as this is not really a quality product besides the budget. It was a huge letdown to see the girl Wolverine act this horribly here. Making sure she won't get her own movie as this is just not good enough. It's nice seeing Blade back as the first movie is awesome and kickstarted the modern superhero industry. Ryan Reynolds jokes about his role in Blade 3 and in other movies often referring to other characters by their name so Wolverine is both from Canada and Australia at the same time. He even refers to 2 real life divorces.Overall it feels timely, but the humor will date horribly in just 5 years when people won't recall the first non-talking Deadpool or Blade 3. Many of the movies they refer to were big action movies that may just not be rewatched by a new generation with access to movies with $200m budgets that bombed. There is way too much to pick from now. And the older movies won't really stand the test of time. Neither will this Deadpool movie. But right now it's a fun watch. Some fight scenes are great, others not ideal. Some acting spectacular other is quite terrible. Overall there is enough good stuff here to be worth a watch. It feels like a lazily written story with terrible editing. But then it doesn't try to be a big superhero movie. It just tries to entertain and it does that.",Helpful,•,2,0,JurijFedorov,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur4032055/?ref_=tturv_usr_84_t,10-Oct-24,

Reynolds should play Deadpool forever. Hugh Jackman is outstanding as Logan/Wolverine. It's an absolute delight to see Jackman finally wear the comic book accurate Wolverine costume, after 24 years playing the iconic character. Ryan Reynolds & Hugh Jackman share effortless camaraderie & exchange the best banter, in all their scenes together. Emma Corrin is fantastic as Cassandra Nova. Matthew Macfadyen is brilliant as Mr. Paradox. The supporting cast is excellent. Deadpool & Wolverine is a must watch for Marvel Cinematic Universe fans & fans of the titular characters.

Not at all.Is it a fun entry that gives the fans a bit more of what they like? Yes.I'm tempted to say this is a worthy cinematic experience.. ONLY because part of me understands this follows in-line with what Far From Home did and what it offered it's audience (enjoying it before somebody ruins it for you). Not because the plot was particularly memorable or well made! But because it rocks an excellent cast of surprises and has Cameos that are exactly what the latest Dr Strange's attempt wanted to be (giving a chance to something meaningful)! Not to mention excellent action choreographies, and how it works as a lovely farewell to a part of the Fox's Marvel entries.Personally, I felt the pacing was too slow in parts, and the movie a tad long. Some of the dialogue becomes tiring after a point, and the well-casted villain becomes an unnecessary cliché after a point.. just for the movie to have an ending. I was also sadly-reminded of the pointless Loki and all it entails. Also, it becomes a bit overindulging at the end, and the CGI gets progressively worse. I think that if the story is good, the CGI's quality shouldn't matter as much, as it serves a purpose to raise one's imagination and help the narrative visually. For this movie, I probably started to notice or care about it, because after a certain point the story is just whatever.But still!

8,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9926130/?ref_=tturv_perm_91,A Very Solid Multiversal Time,"The Deadpool films have always been very enjoyable to me. They've never been endlessly rewatchable, simply due to the crass humour from start to finish, but that's just because I don't want to get tired of them. The first two films found a way to make me smile, but I never felt the need to keep revisiting those same jokes. This time around, we're in a whole new era. Since Disney purchased 20th Century Fox, we've known they were going to let this R-rated franchise continue, but in what way? Well, Deadpool & Wolverine has now hit theatres and I must admit, I once again had a solid time and it is probably the most fun I've had with any of these movies, even though the overall film itself fits right in line with the first two, quality-wise. This is a consistently entertaining franchise of 4/5 star films. Here's why I enjoyed this one, but also why I have a few concerns for those who don't follow every Marvel project.Without getting into too many details, the basic premise of Deadpool & Wolverine begins with Deadpool being pulled into the TVA, where he learns that his world is dying and there's nothing he can do about it. Realizing that Wolverine/Logan passing away is the reason for this, he makes it his mission to hop through dimensions to find another version of that character to help him save his world and the only people he cares about. This leads them to a wasteland where characters and things from the past have all been forgotten. From there, chaos ensues, surprises will please many audience members, and the story becomes more emotionally driven than expected.Again without giving anything away, there are a lot of cameos in this film and I enjoyed every single one of them, whether they were used for a cheap pop or a meaningful reason for being there. The use of a certain character had me in tears and another had me laughing hysterically, so I had a great time with the cameo aspects. The story is also effective enough that it held my attention, but the true core of this film comes down to Deadpool and Wolverine. Hugh Jackman and Ryan Reynolds have clearly dreamt of doing a movie like this together and it shows. Their chemistry is electric and this is definitely a side we haven't seen from Jackman yet as this character. They made this a great experience.There are also needle drops every few minutes, but most of them worked in the context of the scenes. Shawn Levy has directed many films in the past, but never anything like this, so it was nice to see he was capable of content like this. What else can I say about this one? Well, the action is great (like all of the Deadpool films), the cast is fantastic, the humour works 90% of the time, the surprises are a plenty, and the third act actually reeled back from what I thought would be happening. I have to admit that people may have set their expectations a little high as to who and how many characters might appear, but in general, I have no complaints there; However, there are concerns I have for certain audience members.They make it easy enough to follow everything, but some appearances and stories carry over from shows and pieces from other films that, if you haven't seen everything, may make you scratch your head. I know there will be elements lost on some people, but at least the whole point of the movie is just about Deadpool and Wolverine. It's far from perfect and a few aspects (which would spoil your enjoyment if I said them here) are very easy to nitpick, but I have to be honest and say I had a really good time. I can't wait to see more. Deadpool & Wolverine is now playing in theatres.",Helpful,•,3,2,kjproulx,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur23240045/?ref_=tturv_usr_91_t,28-Jul-24,

After numerous disapointements at Marvel both in movies or mini-series on Disney+, this really feel good.",Helpful,•,2,4,destroyerwod,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur3886859/?ref_=tturv_usr_98_t,28-Jul-24,
9,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9920257/?ref_=tturv_perm_99,"Welcomes both the ""Merc with a Mouth"" and his clawed counterpart into the MCU with open arms","""Deadpool & Wolverine"" is the sequel to both 2016's ""Deadpool"" and 2018's ""Deadpool 2"", and the 34th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Directed by Shawn Levy (""Night at the Museum"" trilogy, ""Cheaper by the Dozen"") and starring Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman in the lead roles, it alleviates any doubt that Disney would ruin the iconic ""Merc with a Mouth"" in a film that welcomes both him and his clawed counterpart into the MCU with open arms.Sometime after the events of ""Deadpool 2"", Wade Wilson/Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) is now working as a car salesman after his application to join the Avengers was declined. One night, Wade is enjoying a surprise birthday party with his friends when he is suddenly visited by the Time Variance Authority (TVA), who forcibly take him to their headquarters to meet their high ranking agent Mr. Paradox (Matthew Macfadyen). While there, Mr. Paradox informs Wade that due to his previous escapades through the multiverse, he has inadvertently caused his own universe to unravel, giving him just 72 hours until everyone and everything he loves disappears forever. To prevent this from happening, Mr. Paradox tasks Wade with searching through numerous universes to find a suitable variant of Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) to assist him on his mission. During his journey, Wade eventually stumbles upon a disgraced, alcoholic variant of Wolverine and after some initial hostility, the two pair up to stop further damage from spreading throughout the entire multiverse.In recent years, the MCU has found itself stuck in something of a creative rut, churning out lukewarm to terrible content that is causing the interest of general audiences and longtime fans to dissipate. Though it is indeed a tall order to top the two recent ""Avengers"" films, it has since become clear that the best days of the once adored superhero franchise are now well and truly in the past. When Disney acquired 20th Century Fox in 2017, this allowed for some previously unavailable Marvel heroes to join the MCU, keeping fans hopeful that there could be some exciting new additions in the future. After some lengthy creative negotiations, we now have the first MCU film to focus entirely on heroes once owned by Fox in ""Deadpool & Wolverine"", which makes great use of both character dynamics without ever forgetting their trademark appeal.Something practically everyone knows and loves about Deadpool's character is his crude, unapologetically violent approach to getting the job done, a trait many would assume has no place within the otherwise PG-13 rated MCU. However, it is soon shown to us that this is definitely not the case this time around, as we are quickly treated to all of his signature blood, gore, swearing, and sexual innuendo that many feared would be absent after the Disney buyout. As our red-suited anti-hero playfully hums along to the opening logos, he then breaks the fourth wall in his usual fashion by directly informing the audience that a lot has happened since his previous adventure. We see him make sly references to his IP being under new ownership, the spotty legacy of the 20th Century Fox era of superhero movies, and even some self-referential jabs at the current decline in quality of the MCU itself. This is then followed up with an impressively shot, yet brutally violent action scene set to a song made famous by a popular early 2000s boyband. It was at this point I knew that Deadpool is in good hands with people who actually understand his character, at least for the time being.Similarly, Wolverine's return to the spotlight is handled rather well too. At first, I was apprehensive about revisiting the character out of fear it would diminish the perfect ending to 2017's ""Logan"", but to my relief we soon learn that this is an entirely different variation from another multiverse altogether. This variant is viewed as a complete failure in his universe, reduced to drinking his problems away hoping in vain he will eventually succumb to alcohol poisoning and die, which is impossible considering his genetic makeup. After this Wolverine and Deadpool form an uneasy alliance, we soon see their comedic dynamic come into play. Deadpool is of course the loud-mouthed, wisecracking comic relief making humorous observations to help move the plot along, and Wolverine is the disheveled straight man whose reactions to certain situations allow for him to learn from his previous mistakes. Each of the two characters are given equal amounts of screen time throughout the story, and watching them grow in their own respective ways leads to a very satisfying conclusion on both fronts.In addition to this, the action sequences never stop being fun. Director Shawn Levy frames each of these scenes with all of the same visual style as the previous two ""Deadpool"" films, littering them with graphic violence, sexual references, and the occasional funny allusion to the real-world actors playing the characters involved in the skirmish. Nothing is ever compromised for the sake of appeasing a family-friendly audience, with this film proudly wearing its R rating as a badge of honour. Best of all, there wasn't a single action scene that felt out of place or one where it was hard to tell who was fighting who. Many times I found myself genuinely invested in everything that was happening during a fight, as the outcome could seriously affect how the rest of the story was going to play out. This is something that has been missing from recent MCU films, where most of the action sequences feel pretty much the same the whole way through.Without giving away too much, it is worth mentioning that this film has a number of hidden surprises and cameos that aren't strictly limited to just the MCU. In one scene, both Deadpool and Wolverine team up with other heroes who have been absent for a very long time, which is sure to excite people in a similar manner to that portals scene in ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"". These characters were used well within the context of the story, and some of them I had almost forgotten about had this film not reminded me of their existence. Of course, I am not going to reveal who they all are due to spoilers, so all I will say is that it has me curious to see what could happen in future MCU projects if Disney ever decides to use them again.I have said it twice before and I will say it again; Ryan Reynolds was born to play the role of Wade Wilson/Deadpool. From his quick-witted observations at whatever predicament he has found himself in to his assured skills in weaponry and hand-to-hand combat, there is simply no other actor out there capable of imitating Reynolds's trademark charisma. What's also interesting here is watching how much Wade has changed in between the previous film and this one. It is established that Wade desperately longs to become one of the Avengers, naturally feeling devastated upon finding out he has been turned down by those he admires most. This has clearly affected his self-esteem, and watching Wade try to regain his signature confidence over the course of the story is a nice way to help him develop into the worthy hero he wishes to become.Likewise, it is great to see Hugh Jackman return to the role that made him into an international star. As mentioned earlier, this Wolverine is at rock bottom, having failed to meet all of the expectations required of him in his respective universe. He fully realises he has messed things up, and it is going to take somebody as determined as Deadpool to drag him out of this hole. Jackman maintains that same amount of surliness and feeling of inadequacy as all of his previous versions of Wolverine, only this time it is used to play off his comedic partner in Deadpool. Though he clearly can't stand him at first, Wolverine soon realises that Deadpool is an important catalyst towards his potential redemption, and so begrudgingly tolerates his antics throughout the film. It is here we see that Reynolds and Jackman have great chemistry with each other, with their interactions contributing many humorous and heartfelt moments that feel right at home with the MCU.For anyone still uncertain over the future of both IPs, ""Deadpool & Wolverine"" is sure to put most people at ease with its seamless integration into the rest of the MCU. It treats the characters with the same level of respect as their fans and it never lets up with everything that made each of them so iconic in the first place. Although I think it's a bit early to tell if the MCU has now been ""saved"" from its downward spiral, I can at least say that this film provides a highly entertaining experience regardless of which direction things end up going. At this point in time, that reason alone is something commendable.I rate it a solid 9/10.",Helpful,•,11,9,MrDHWong,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur18374284/?ref_=tturv_usr_99_t,25-Jul-24,
7,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9918959/?ref_=tturv_perm_100,A wild ride of fun,"""Deadpool and Wolverine"" is a highly entertaining film that takes some bold creative risks, making it a refreshing addition to the superhero genre. However, it does fall short in terms of plot and narrative depth.The film's formula, while familiar, is executed well. It doesn't require viewers to have an encyclopedic knowledge of the Marvel universe, which is a refreshing change from some recent entries in the franchise. This accessibility is a welcome relief for casual fans who might feel overwhelmed by the interconnected storylines and myriad characters of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.One of the film's greatest strengths is its unabashed fan service. Much like ""Spider-Man: No Way Home,"" it delights in bringing together beloved characters and playing to the audience's nostalgia and affection for the franchise. This approach ensures that the film is engaging and fun, even if it doesn't break new ground. The interactions between Deadpool and Wolverine are especially enjoyable, filled with the irreverent humor and banter that fans have come to expect from Deadpool and the gruff, no-nonsense attitude of Wolverine.However, ""Deadpool and Wolverine"" does suffer from a lack of substantial plot. The narrative feels more like a series of entertaining vignettes than a cohesive story. There's a sense that the film is more concerned with delivering memorable moments and fan-pleasing scenes than with crafting a compelling, overarching plot. As a result, it can feel somewhat aimless and insubstantial.In conclusion, ""Deadpool and Wolverine"" is a fun, enjoyable movie that succeeds in delivering fan service and entertaining character interactions. It may not be a masterpiece, but it doesn't need to be. Its primary goal is to entertain, and in that regard, it succeeds admirably. For fans of the characters, it's certainly worth a watch, even if it doesn't leave a lasting impact.",Helpful,•,19,20,DLochner,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur12740916/?ref_=tturv_usr_100_t,24-Jul-24,

This film is directed, partly written and produced by Shawn Levy, director of Night at the Museum, Reel Steal and Free Guy.After all Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) his adventures he is now trying to take it easy. He tries to live a more normal life, without using his superhero alter ego Deadpool. This changes when the time agents of the TVA come after him for all the adjustments he has made to the timelines.When mutant Cassandra Nova (Emma Corrin) then forms a bigger oath, Deadpool must try to stop this threat together with a variant of Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), before all timelines are in danger.After Disney took over the film studio 20th Century Fox, they also got the film rights of the X-men, as well as the rights of the character Deadpool. Deadpool is actually not a character you expect to see in the more child-friendly world of Disney. Fortunately, they have found a good way to bring back the character of Deadpool in a familiar way, without making it really child-friendly. This is, strangely enough, the first official r rated superhero film in the Marvel film series.It is good to see that Disney now also seems to dare to make more adult films, so that they can also please older viewers. This film is such an entertaining r rated film, with brutal action, blood, swear words and other adult material. The Disney film studio gives itself more opportunities to also make films about adult material. In this way, in addition to family and children's films, they can now also try to reach the adult target group with their own r rated films. In addition, they can now also try to use other, more adult acquired film rights from 20th Century Fox, to also make these film series their own or to continue with them.Ryan Reynolds has, in addition to playing the lead role, also been involved in this film as a producer and writer. In this way, he has made a great effort to ensure that the character remains as well-known as possible for fans of the character. Fans who know Deadpool from the two previous Deadpool films, from the comics or from other films, or animations can have a similar experience with this new film. Furthermore, he also provides many moments of meta humor about the film world, other things from pop culture and of course moments where he breaks the fourth wall. Hugh Jackman seemed to be done with playing the Wolverine character, after the film Logan from 2017. When Ryan shared his ideas with him, to come back as the character again, he eventually did so. The two are also good friends with each other and, like their characters, have good chemistry. In this way, they know how to play well with and against each other.Fortunately, the story has also become a good thing of its own, because many feared that this film would become more of a film with comic references and cameos. Several cameos and references are in the film, but fortunately without them overshadowing the film and trying to be something of their own. So, after a more low point in the Marvel film series, they can hopefully handle the future film ideas and stories a bit better after this film and get the series back in shape.Director Shawn Levy already has experience with directing action films, but in this comic film adaptation, during some action scenes, many things happen at the same time with several different characters. Here, everything is sometimes not always clearly shown, so you can't always follow everything exactly. This can sometimes take you out of the film or cause confusion.",Helpful,•,0,1,movieman6-413-929510,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur34790048/?ref_=tturv_usr_101_t,28-Jul-24,

Today, I managed to watch it and here is my review for Deadpool & Wolverine. After rejecting an offer to join The Marvel Cinematic Universe, Deadpool must find Wolverine in order to save his timeline.Main Character
Ryan Reynolds plays Wade Wilson/Deadpool and he is just born to play the role and he does give a great performance in this film. He is just really funny and does manage to deliver on the occasional emotional scenes that are required. Hugh Jackman also makes his return as Logan/Wolverine and he is just fantastic here and I love watching him in this role. The chemistry between Jackman & Reynolds is
off the charts and easily carries this film and seeing them together is great.Supporting Characters
Emma Corrin plays Cassandra Nova and she is a fun addition to the film. She is clearly revelling in her role and I liked how her powers were shown. I wish she had a little more screen time and her motivations were better but I think she does enough to create a fun villain.Matthew Macfayden plays Paradox who is the TVA Agent in charge of the situation and it is a lot of fun to watch him on screen with these other performers as he is incredibly charming and quick witted with his dialogue.The film has a bunch of decently sized roles from people not announced before the film so I will not mention them here but they are good fun. Though if you are a fan of the supporting cast from the first two films then you will be disappointed because they play minimal roles here.Story
The story does a really good job of progressing the characters of both Deadpool & Wolverine and the relationship that they have and I very much felt satisfied by the end of the film. However, this film does really lack plot and interesting motivations for the villain. It does sometimes feel like Deadpool and Wolverine are just meeting people for comedic value and not necessarily for narrative reasons.Script
The script is really funny, there is so much material to work with for Deadpool to break the fourth wall and he uses it to the maximum amount and it usually nails it. The drama is also pretty well done and it manages to flesh out the two main protagonists.Style
When Deadpool moved to Marvel Studios there was a fear that it would be nurtured a little bit but that is not the case. The violence is huge mixed with the bad language and the action scenes are fantastic with some really creative battles on the screen. But, I actually thought the pacing of the film was a little off, it rams so much into it and the first act is a bit slow that I did find it a bit disjointed at times.Overall
Overall, Deadpool & Wolverine is a great film. If you are a Marvel or Deadpool fan then you will enjoy this film and I am glad that the essence of this franchise still exists and that this film does deliver in being a fun summer blockbuster.Rating - 8/10.",Helpful,•,2,2,alindsayal,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur147091341/?ref_=tturv_usr_105_t,30-Jul-24,

This is a hard R due to suggestive dialogue, tremendously and continuously foul language, and extreme violence and gore end to end. I'm not a parent but I must sound like one but you guys need to know this is NOT for kids. There's a continuing profluence of stabbing, goring, dismemberment, and decapitations, it's just horrific when you think about it. But this is what you get when Disney unleashes Ryan Reynolds and Shawn Levy (director) to make them money since they've lost so much due to their DEI experiments. Ryan's ""Deadpool"" makes incessant snide remarks against Fox and other entertainment structures. However, if you don't like Deadpool's constant smart assery, Wolverine delivers an awesome 2+ minute takedown right to his face at 1hr 2m in, it's fantastic. In fact, throughout the film Wolverine is just disgusted with Deadpool, barely softening at the end. Whereas many reviewers lament the lack of a plot, I see a clear story there, I don't get the confusion, and it's a pretty good story of character redemption. There were many tremendous cameos by stars you're really happy to see but let me talk about the Cassandra Nova character for a moment. She looms large in this film as the main antagonist; she's the sister of X-Men's professor Xavier. Now, she's deliciously evil with awesome abilities but she appears with absolutely no sex appeal, intentionally apparently. I really miss that dimension of character portrayal but these are the times in which we live now, androgyny trumps sex appeal, ugh, whatever. Having said all that, the film is really a lot of fun for its irreverent, witty dialogue but the violence/action is beyond what's really needed, it's next level psychotic.

The special effects and acting were good and the action set to music pieces were superb.

There's something about the formula with this character (aka Ryan Reynolds breaking the fourth wall while making vulgar jokes and grotesquely killing people) that guarantees diminishing returns. Every time Wade Wilson shows up, the stakes feel lower and I care a little less. The story almost seems beside the point now; everybody is too busy making jokes and explaining plotlines to tell a real story. That said, I did laugh a bunch. If you tell enough jokes, some of them are bound to land. It is basically Spider-man: No Way Home but with dick jokes and exploding heads. But for all our wondering about what would happen when the MCU and Fox merged, the answer seems to be that you get the best and worst of both. And that means we're still stuck with multiverse movies that spend all their time explaining things and then undoing the things they just explained.

5,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9921937/?ref_=tturv_perm_109,Deadpool in the Multiverse of Exposition,"So first of all, don't get me wrong. This movie is a lot of fun with great action sequences from start to finish and even though I hate relying on cameos and references, it's still surprising and nice to see some of those faces in the MCU.But, this movie with 5 writers still can't escape the trap of post-Endgame Marvel scripts. This movie is actually the epitome of what's wrong with the last two phases of the MCU. They messed up with Doctor Strange 2 once by making the movie just 2 hours and not giving ample time to anything, and they somehow did the same thing here.This movie is actually the Multiverse of Madness people were expecting. Fans will rejoice seeing what fanservice they're gonna throw at them in this movie. But all of them are the at cost of the plot.Just like Spider-Man: No Way Home, if you already didn't see the problem with the writing of this movie and think it's great or a masterpiece because they did some cameos, you're definitely gonna see the cracks in the plot with the second viewing when you're not just focused on the eye-candy action scenes and cameos.The biggest problem with this movie is exposition. This movie's dialogues have the subtlety of a hand grenade. It looks like the head writer of this movie is dyslexic and while reading the guide to writing a script, mistakenly read ""Tell, don't show"" instead. Because my God this whole movie is a big giant exposition. And no, being self-aware and meta about it doesn't excuse it when everybody in this movie is just expositing. This movie had a budget of $200 million, but they didn't have the budget to shoot more scenes for at the very least the Wolverine of this movie? Even he exposits his backstory as if his name isn't in the title and isn't one of the main characters. ""I guess just saying some lines is enough for the audience to care about the characters"", the writers thought to themselves. And I guess 70% of the budget went to the cameo actors.At least with the Multiverse of Madness, we had the backstory of Scarlet Witch from WandaVision and it was the same character we've seen since 2014. This Wolverine is a whole new character that I already forgot about what happened in his universe, because guess what, they don't show you anything, just him talking about it. They rely on your beforehand knowledge of his character for you to sympathize with him and care about him. But sorry, it just doesn't cut it for me.Even if we are to compare this movie to Deadpool 2, this movie still pales in comparison, and I didn't even like Deadpool 2 that much either. Now Deadpool 2 seems like a really good movie after watching this. Somehow this is the worst of all three Deadpool films. At the very least I can respect Deadpool 2 for actually having the semblance of a plot with a somewhat well-written villain and new characters like Cable, whom they actually Showed his backstory instead of him only dropping some exposition every 10 minutes! That movie didn't have to rely on 20 years of pop culture to trick the audience into thinking they were watching a competent film. They actually went and wrote a real plot for a movie that actually feels like a movie based on stories and characters from comic books, and gave them decent characterization unlike this movie.But this movie barely has any plot. Just like Multiverse of Madness and No Way Home, this movie finds a lame excuse to throw multiverse into the mix so that we can have cameo galore. And I really really hate the whole world-ending plot every single superhero movie and show has. It was already lame and trite 10 years ago, and it still is. I roll my eyes every time the goal of the villain of these movies and shows is to destroy the fabric of the universe. I bet they're gonna come up with a world-ending plot for the finale of their new Daredevil show too, can't wait to see that masterpiece!It is also funny that this whole movie revolves around the TVA and the Void, and the movie has cameos you wouldn't've even dreamt of, but they somehow don't even mention or involve Loki here. It's weird since with what happens in the finale of Loki, you'd think this would be the perfect movie to actually mention him or something, but nope.Like I said, if this movie was longer and they actually developed Wolverine's character a bit to make us care about him instead of relying on previous movies and distracting us with cameos, and maybe instead of having Wolverine fight Deadpool every 15 minutes (which were really good nonetheless), you actually spent some time with that Wolverine and did more with him, it would've made the movie a lot better and more competent. But unfortunately, nothing's changed and the latest Marvel movie still suffers from barely having a plot and competent script.Overall, while this movie is really fun to watch and has great action scenes and some surprising cameos, the plot is nearly nonexistent, the characters are one-dimensional, and the overall script and the dialogue are awful. You can basically call this film ""Exposition: The Movie"" and you wouldn't be wrong. If you're a hardcore superhero fan and MCU fanboy who still likes the movies after Endgame for some reason and only cares about cameos and pop culture references, you're gonna love this. But if you're tired of the same superhero movie with the same plot and are actually expecting a movie that feels like a movie that has a competent plot and decent dialogue and characterization, you're gonna be sorely disappointed.",Helpful,•,16,19,MamadNobari97,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur45507551/?ref_=tturv_usr_109_t,26-Jul-24,

Since when has a moving picture become a theme park?I always liked Deadpool and his unconventional self-centered and mocking, uncensored and fourth-wall breaking humor and Deadpool & Wolverine has got that over the edge and more but what else is this Poolverse of madness besides a big cash grab and a huge fan service comic book geek fest? Yeah, that about sums up the whole movie but boy it is fun to watch though.In the credits there are five guys behind the script to Deadpool & Wolverine including the maestro Ryan Reynolds himself and you can't help but seeing it in almost every frame (the first Deadpool was written by just two people) as so many characters appear per second you can blink and miss some big reveal. Naturally when there are a lot of people involved into one project they each bring their ideas and by mixing them together they can either get a disastrous mish-mash of a movie or a masterpiece and I believe in this case they did a bit of both.My biggest and probably the only issue with this movie is that it tries to please every single soul on the planet starting with Kevin Feige (and he sure is pleased by the box office results) but it fails as a cohesive body of work with its almost non-existent plot. Those bits of authentic script when the characters factually talk and communicate with each other and share their moments with one another are so rare and scattered they make you miss classic human interaction but they do make up for the many brainless fight scenes instead. When Deadpool or Wolverine break down their characters the movie shines brightest. Sure if we're off to see a superhero bloody gore fun time of a movie we're not looking for some real emotions, we're just in it for the sheer entertainment of it, to switch our own respective realities for a bit and just enjoy the big names party hosted by Ryan and Hugh Jackman.I'm no fan of superhero movies, in fact my only exception to the rule was Deadpool (and in the world of TV it's obviously The Boys) - he embodied my attitude toward superhero movies and expressed it loudly to the screen with a middle finger but with this entry he somewhat succumbed to the whole thing that he himself was so against of as if saying ""okey doke if I'm doing this at least let me do it my way"". Considering this I can't give Deadpool & Wolverine a better rating than of the two previous films but overall I liked it a lot - multiverse-wise it works ten thousand percent and is easily an A+ but narrative-wise it's pretty mediocre and is a C so a strong B is in order then.",Helpful,•,3,2,jamesjustice-92,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur71097662/?ref_=tturv_usr_110_t,4-Oct-24,

Despite the grand scale-Deadpool literally trying to save a universe-it didn't feel dense or carry much weight.At the same time, I understand why. The MCU has faced criticism for making the multiverse phase too convoluted and confusing, especially for the average viewer who hasn't seen every movie and TV show. So, despite the scale of this movie, the story remains very easy and simple to follow. It felt like Marvel was playing it safe, which makes sense and worked out well for what Marvel maybe needed at this point.I loved the movie; it was fun, funny, and simple. However, it didn't wow me. It didn't need to be a cinematic masterpiece or the best MCU movie ever made-it just had to be good and give hope for mcu's future. It delivered on that. Plus basically a perfect Deadpool trilogy. I have more thoughts, but they are quite spoiler-y. I also thought Cassandra Nova could have been a much more menacing villain. They showed her strength, but her character was quite underdeveloped.

It's a Deadpool movie, so there is a lot of vulgar jokes and one liners asides and inside innuendo about superhero movies, drugs, sex, and violence. It's also a team-up with Wolverine from the Fox Films X-Men film franchise, and so he brings a more nuanced darker subtler tone with dramatic A-list acting. But, it's also a Disney/Marvel film and contains the ever-confusing multiverse.The combination is a strange film that doesn't always work...but so what? It's fun as hell! Deadpool and Wolverine run around the multiverse battling villains and heroes, some new some old, from multiple superhero movies. They also deal with Professor Xavier's evil sister, and a bureaucrat from the multiverse with his own agenda. All to save Deadpool's timeline - which can only happen if a Wolverine who destroyed his timeline can snap out of his depression.While there are probably a few too may corny jokes the middle of this film that get kind of old - near the end the two heroes have to battle an army of Deadpools...which is a flat out a hoot and anyone who says otherwise is crazy. It's really hard not to appreciate how much fan service they do in this film - and how great Hugh Jackman is as Wolverine.When the film is over - you're glad Hugh Jackman has been brought into the Marvel universe and you absolutely want to see more films with him. Would love to see him team up with Spider-Man, for example.

Deadpool & Wolverine has some good moments but honestly, compared to the previous movies, the quality has kind of dropped.Deadpool and Wolverine clearly is fan-service which isn't a bad thing because fan-service can create good crowd-pleasers. This movie does carry good chemistry and energy between one another that creates a fun action movie with good uses of thrills and stunt work and solid performances from the entire cast members. It was nice to see Deadpool and Wolverine going head-to-head and teaming together.Unfortunately, this is the kind of fan-service that is pretty rough on it's edges. Because as a whole, i's writing and style is pretty much the same standard superhero movie structure. Filled with typical tropes as the usual and concepts that are a bit messy. Shawn Levy's direction was dull and the camerawork and production, at times feel a bit cheap. Including rough dialogue moments and other characters that are dull and unlikeable to care.On it's humor, compared to its previous movies, the humor didn't work for me as I personally think it has gotten a bit worse with the humor feeling like it's about references rather being creative or people thinking curse words are the best jokes ever. That kind of non-serious humor that thinks breaking the fourth wall, throwing over-used jabs, and tone that thinks it's being clever but it falls flat.

The new characters were pretty phenomenal for everything that had been culminated into a presentation of greatness and cabaret no less. And also sorry for the 20th Century FOX universe about to be altered for eternity, (Diss to the knee, even with Blue Sky Studios), you shall be paid proper homage for your years of nostalgia, (if someone didn't probably do so for you already). The cinematography was well mentally and crucially balanced for the tone of seriousness with gory violence and facetious humor that blew me away even for the 3rd time in a long time, (in forever), stellar portrayals for prom the thespians, (especially for the renowned Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman as the prime eponymous protagonists).As for the prime antagonist, I wasn't too agitated and irritably bothered by one of the antagonists being Cassandra Nova, (but that's less incorrigibly made up for by Paradox, who I thought to be another different variant of Mobius, but I'm more than erroneous up to that particular point). The heavy emotions were carried out nicely as well as the choreography fight scenarios were in the least with a bundle of different ensemble characters from the past, (shan't mention who specifically but good things come to those who wait, even if it isn't everything everywhere all at once, ;) alluding to another 2022 multiverse movie). And did I forget to conscientiously mention about the costume designs for not merely Deadpool but also Wolverine, nice homage to the glorious late 30s comic-book accurate appeal, it's rather satisfying and riveting for how well it was approached in that regard without being to mundane or that overall garnished somewhat. The music homages and the soundtrack was phenomenal as I almost forgot to mention for the prior precursors of Deadpool, (I'll avow to not disclose), and hopefully maybe Deadpool won't merely become Marvel Jesus and alter the course of the status quo of the MCU Phases 4 and beyond, can't wait for much more in store becoming cooking up a concocted pall.Overall, this true pure magnum opus is all the more breathtaking to say for the least that is truly, and might just practically even surpass its precursors by a mere milestone, this for me gets a 9.9/10, no more, no less.",Helpful,•,2,2,d_penn,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur104962846/?ref_=tturv_usr_132_t,12-Aug-24,

This offering's predecessors (2016, 2018) significantly distinguished themselves from the kind of fare typically found in the superhero genre with their outrageously bawdy humor, hilarious sight gags and relentlessly maverick attitude. This time out, however, director Shawn Levy's latest effort is a decidedly hit or miss affair, with an often-incoherent script that feels like it was cobbled together from a collection of leftover parts, some of which work and some of which don't. I suppose that's not entirely surprising from a screenplay that was penned by four different writers, making me wonder how much consensus was in place in compiling the finished product. Moreover, this film appears to be intended to fold the Deadpool franchise into the X-Men franchise, an intriguing idea that, regrettably, is handled rather clumsily (as has often been the case with many other recent fusion offerings in the Marvel Universe). And, if all that weren't bad enough, this release gives short shrift to the colorful cast of supporting players that made the Deadpool films so funny, original and enjoyable, relegating them to little more than cameos in favor of walk-ons by a host of other MCU characters (some of them remarkably obscure, I might add) in an attempt to help cement the franchise cross-pollination going on here. It makes for awkward storytelling at times, especially for viewers who might not be familiar with these lesser-known figures, some of which are drawn from Marvel source material unrelated to its big screen offerings. To the picture's credit, it features yet another stellar turn by Ryan Reynolds as the off-color protagonist, as well as its share of hilarious bits (without a doubt the franchise's historically strongest suit), including a number of unabashed, razor-sharp asides referencing off-screen developments related to the studios that produced these films and the actors who have appeared in them. These strengths notwithstanding, however, this is a production that has sadly watered down the elements that best made this franchise work in favor of an overarching programming agenda that simply doesn't serve this film or the series particularly well. The creators would have served themselves and viewers better by sticking with what works and the basics of good storytelling than trying to force an issue for the sake of future productions that may or may not work over the long term. This has been a noticeable downfall in the quality of many of the most recent Marvel Universe releases, and I'd truly hate to see this franchise befall a similar fate.",Helpful,•,6,9,brentsbulletinboard,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur156441404/?ref_=tturv_usr_133_t,27-Jul-24,

The first film introduced us to the gritty, gruesome origin of Deadpool, and its dark tone was perfectly balanced with a fresh, comical, anything-goes style of production that we had never seen before. Ryan Reynolds nailed the role. By the time *Deadpool 2* arrived, fans were hungry for more of that same style, and not only did it deliver, but it also gave us a compelling plot with the introduction of Cable, played by Josh Brolin.However, this third movie seems to miss the mark completely. While Ryan's comedic performance is once again a highlight-and arguably the best part of the movie-after a while, the jokes start to wear thin and even become annoying. There's a time and place for everything, but in this film, it feels like nothing was taken seriously. And because Deadpool didn't take anything seriously, neither did we, which ultimately detracted from the entire experience.The cameos were fantastic, but the story itself fell flat. It was so poorly constructed that it felt like it was written by AI. I would even go so far as to say it's one of the worst plots in Marvel history. It made no sense from the beginning, and it's a shame they dragged a complex character like Wolverine into this mess.In the end, the film was dull, predictable, and annoyingly funny-not in the good way the first two were.",Helpful,•,8,5,therealjaysmoke,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur66492393/?ref_=tturv_usr_134_t,1-Oct-24,

The puppy is in the frame!,"""Deadpool and Wolverine"" is a film that is ready to send adults (and it is for adults) to their youth or even childhood. A picture that gives out an eerie stream of interesting things, without giving you a break even for a second. This is a real celebration of the history of superhero cinema, a tribute to all the best that we have seen on screen in recent decades. The film successfully combines the spirit of old tapes and the freshness of the modern Marvel Cinematic Universe, creating a unique spectacular adventure that sees off past eras with love and dignity.One of the film's strengths is acting. Ryan Reynolds, returning to the role of Deadpool, shows unsurpassed skill, balancing on the edge of sarcasm, black humor and sincerity. His Deadpool remains the same brash, witty and unpredictable, causing laughter and admiration from the audience. Hugh Jackman, who has tried on Wolverine's claws again, brings his unique charisma and depth to the film, showing a hero who has come a long way.The script of the film is full of humor and irony, with dizzying jokes that not only mock superhero cliches, but also subtly play with the expectations of the audience. Wild and brazen jokes just blow the roof off, demonstrating that ""Deadpool and Wolverine"" is not afraid to be bold and unusual. This film makes you laugh at yourself and at the whole genre, while maintaining respect for its history and heritage.Special attention should be paid to the numerous cameos and small stories of other characters that fill the picture. These moments not only evoke nostalgia, but also add depth and richness to the plot. They serve as pleasant surprises for fans, skillfully weaving into the general outline of the narrative and enriching the world in which the characters live.""Deadpool and Wolverine"" successfully fits into the already well-known Marvel Cinematic Universe, without losing its uniqueness. The film combines elements of comedy, drama and action, creating a colorful and vivid spectacle. This film becomes a worthy ending for the story of some characters and at the same time a new beginning for others, allowing them to look into the future with optimism and expectation.The script skillfully touches on the themes of friendship, devotion and heroism. Even in its ironic and sarcastic style, the film does not forget about the human aspects and emotional moments, making the characters more alive and real.The film also stands out for its great action and thoughtful choreography of battle scenes. These episodes are needed, the fans have been waiting for them, I'm sure they won't be disappointed. I was thrilled. The production combines the intensity and entertainment inherent in the best representatives of the genre, and the unique style inherent in Deadpool and Wolverine. The use of special effects and makeup at the highest level, especially impressive are the scenes using the abilities of the characters and their incredible regeneration.It is worth noting the participation of a talented team of creators, including director Sean Levy, who has already proved himself in projects with a vivid visual style and the ability to work with actors. Under his guidance, the film maintains a balance between humor and drama, without slipping into excessive seriousness, but also without turning into a pure parody.The film is also notable for its high production quality: The costumes of the heroes, from the classic Deadpool costume to the updated Wolverine image, are made with great attention to detail. The creators seem to have satisfied the desires of everyone, without exception, by showing on the screen everything that is needed and what the fans were waiting for. The soundtrack includes both original tracks and familiar compositions that create a special atmosphere and enhance the emotional impact.The creators did not forget about comic book fans either: the film has a lot of references and ""Easter eggs"" that will delight connoisseurs and fans of the franchise. These elements make viewing even more fun and layered, giving fans the opportunity to discuss and discover new details even after several views.We had to wait a long time for a new and, more importantly, a high-quality project in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. And ""Deadpool and Wolverine"" is becoming, as I see it, an important milestone in the history of the Multiverse, around which the global story has been spinning for the last few years. It's not just a movie, it's an event that marks the end of one era and the beginning of another. He combines all the best things that we loved in superhero movies, and does it with respect and admiration. This is a colorful, bright and timely film that will delight both long-time fans and new viewers.9 out of 10.",Helpful,•,27,29,alekspredator87,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur52780913/?ref_=tturv_usr_140_t,2-Aug-24,

Overall, an entertaining return for Deadpool & Wolverine as the humor and chemistry between the two leads establish their metacomedic entrance into the MCU and send off a love-letter to 20th Century Fox, but this ultimately holds this movie back a bit because it is not focused on which narrative they want to tell.Direction: Good
The direction on a macroscale feels like a blend of 20th Century Fox Marvel with the MCU as it has elements of both, with Deadpool serving as the bridge; the direction on a microscale is body-cop/dueling protagonist movie between Deadpool and Wolverine; the storytelling is a step back as it tries to do too much, it tries to be this love-letter to 20th Century Fox but sacrifices it being an MCU movie or tying back to the original Deadpool moviesStory: Decent
The concept is really a buddy-cop movie between Deadpool and Wolverine; but they try to do too much that the movie does not really feel focused on what they want to tell; they try to have this movie connect to the original Deadpool movies but they are more focused with being this love-letter to 20th Century Fox and having an MCU tie-in; this movie feels more like a spiritual successor to the original Deadpool movies rather than a sequel; the plot structure is fine as it follows the traditional Marvel template; the character writing is good for the two protagonists as the movie is about redemption and finding purposeScreenplay: Very Good
The dialogue is still good as it is still filled with metacomedy and fourth-wall breaking, and it does a very good job at taking jabs at the MCU; the humor is still good and helps make this feel like a Deadpool movie, but it does feel a bit separated from the first two movies; the symbolism is pretty strong as the whole movie is about redemption and finding purpose; the foreshadowing is pretty standard with other Marvel movies, so it makes it a bit predictableActing: Good to Very Good
Ryan Reynolds: Very Good (Continues where he left off, as he perfectly embodies the role, as it feels like he is Deadpool; from his comedic mannerisms to his meta, fourth-wall breaking, but feels more relaxed this time around, as he is still comfortable in the role and pokes fun at the MCU in order to save his connection to 20th Century Fox; Has great chemistry with Hugh Jackman)
Hugh Jackman: Very Good (Continues where he left off in ""Logan"" as he shows why he is the only person who will play Wolverine; he has great chemistry with Ryan Reynolds)
Emma Corrin: Good (A good villain who has good charisma and good line delivery; they have great chemistry with the two leads)
Matthew Macfadyen: Good (Tom Wambsgans being Tom Wambsgans)
Rest of the cast: Good (All the performances in this movie feel elevated this time around as opposed to the minor characters in the first two Deadpool movies; for the cameos, they do a good job in their roles; for the original Deadpool movies, they feel more like cameos and are underutilized)Score: Pretty GoodSoundtrack: Very Good
Used very well and helped make this movie fun and feel very DeadpoolCinematography: Very Good to Great
The action sequences feel very above and beyond and a new benchmark for superhero movies to follow, especially with some of the new shot techniques they triedEditing: Very Good
The whole movie feels very seamless and polished; it feels like they used the expanded budget well in the technical processSound: Very GoodVisual Effects: Very Good
An improvement on both the Deadpool movies and recent MCU films, as it feels very detailed and helps show the blood and action Deadpool was trying to get at in the first two moviesProduction Design: Good
Helps paint the world, in a somewhat comedic wayCostumes: Very Good
It uses the iconic Deadpool and Wolverine costumes to make this movie an homage to the original comic-book charactersPacing
Pacing is good for the most part, but kind of drags in some points; maybe 10-15 minutes could have been cutClimax
Climax is well executed and helps bring together the movie (especially the large fight scene in the end)Tone
Tone is very metacomedy mixed with a superhero movie; while the movie does have some MCU elements, it feels like this movie still feels like a Deadpool movieFinal Notes
It felt like this movie has given less restriction than other MCU movies; but there still are moments where it felt like Feige stepped in.",Helpful,•,4,2,cinemapersonified,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur82414298/?ref_=tturv_usr_142_t,27-Jul-24,

It connects Fox's X-Men universe with the MCU through the multiverse. It features the Time Variance Authority (TVA) that was introduced in Loki, which is the only other project that the TVA appears in so far. It is the first time Professor X's twin sister Cassandra Nova appears in film. It features her as a leader of the Void and a multiversal threat. Her power is pretty similar to that of her brother. She's a pretty powerful telepath but her powers has her having to be more physical with the other character.It does seem to focus on quite a bit of cameos. It explores the multiverse through the cameos and sometimes it focuses more on that. I don't want to spoil on all of the cameos and how much there are, but I figured to mention that there are a couple and at times, it's more that than actual plot. I feel like that's why it did so good at the box office.I feel like it would definitely influence the future of the MCU as it is the first R rated film and the multiverse story (we're in the multiverse saga). It is the third MCU film to earn a billion after Endgame, the first two was Spider-Man Far From Home and No Way Home. It has beaten the first Joker as the highest grossing R rated film of all time.

I was worried bringing back Wolverine was out of desperation, and it probably was, but it paid off.

Wolverines world also reminds you that some good superhero movies have been made and maybe it's possible again.As for the actual plot of this movie it's not really all that interesting. However, making the TVA a key feature of the movie was also clever. One thing from this saga most enjoyed was Loki. By including the TVA, Marvel has set up the potential for a nice conclusion to the saga instead of dragging us through more money making clutter.One thing that I will also add is that aside from Endgame , having watched lots of previous content will make the film much more rewarding. There are a lot of nice easter eggs along the way in this one. The soundtrack is probably also second best to Guardians.In conclusion, as a stand alone , the movie would probably be average with some funny moments you'd forget by the end of the ride home from the theatre.

In a cinematic landscape filled with larger-than-life heroes, Ryan Reynolds' Deadpool and Hugh Jackman's Wolverine stand out as the most unexpected, yet perfect duo. Their onscreen chemistry, comedic timing, and action-packed sequences create a masterpiece that's both entertaining and downright ridiculous - and that's exactly what makes this team-up worth every second.Ryan Reynolds is Deadpool. There's no separating the actor from his iconic role. Having fought hard to bring this character to life, Reynolds has made Deadpool one of the most beloved antiheroes in the superhero genre. Wade Wilson, aka Deadpool, is everything a traditional hero is not - foul-mouthed, irreverent, self-aware, and an expert in breaking the fourth wall. He talks to the audience, mocks his own movie, and never stops with the snappy, hilarious quips.In this film, Deadpool is at his peak, blending insane stunts with relentless jokes. Reynolds' comedic timing is impeccable, and his ability to make even the most violent fight scene laugh-out-loud funny is part of his genius. With Deadpool, it's not just about the action, but the ridiculous commentary that accompanies every move. And what better foil for Deadpool's madness than the no-nonsense, claw-wielding Wolverine?For almost two decades, Hugh Jackman has been the definitive Wolverine, and his return as the gruff, brooding mutant is a dream come true for fans. Wolverine's healing factor and adamantium claws make him one of the toughest heroes around, and Jackman brings that raw intensity back to the screen effortlessly. However, it's not just Wolverine's brute strength that makes him so compelling - it's his tortured soul and reluctance to embrace heroism that have always set him apart.In this team-up, Wolverine acts as the perfect counterbalance to Deadpool's manic energy. Jackman's straight-man performance contrasts brilliantly with Reynolds' relentless quips, and their dynamic is a classic odd-couple pairing that creates some of the movie's best moments. Wolverine's gruffness is both a source of comedic frustration and admiration for Deadpool, who never misses a chance to crack a joke at Wolverine's expense.The magic of Deadpool and Wolverine's partnership lies in their opposites-attract dynamic. While Wolverine is grounded and serious, Deadpool is wild and unpredictable, and together they form a combustible pair. Their differing approaches to heroism only add to the film's hilarity - Wolverine's focused, determined mission is constantly interrupted by Deadpool's unpredictable antics and off-the-cuff remarks. The way Jackman's intense stoicism plays against Reynolds' nonstop commentary is nothing short of comedic gold.This odd-couple chemistry also shines through in the film's action sequences. Wolverine's brutal, up-close combat style contrasts with Deadpool's chaotic, anything-goes approach. Their fight scenes together are an exciting blend of raw power and outrageous stunts, all while keeping the audience laughing with Deadpool's irreverent running commentary. Whether it's taking down enemies or bickering with each other, the duo never lets the action lose its sense of fun and unpredictability.The film itself is a wild ride from start to finish, blending comedy, action, and heart in a way that keeps the audience hooked. The chaotic energy of Deadpool, the stoic grit of Wolverine, and their sharp banter make for a superhero movie that never takes itself too seriously. Even amidst the explosions, blood, and intense fight scenes, there's an underlying lightness that makes the film feel fresh and engaging. It's a testament to how well these two characters, despite being so different, can complement each other on-screen.What makes this team-up even more rewarding is the clear love and respect both Reynolds and Jackman have for their characters. Their performances feel like a love letter to the fans who have followed Deadpool and Wolverine for years. There's a joy in their performances that's infectious - you can tell they had a blast making this film, and that energy transfers directly to the audience. For longtime fans of these two iconic characters, the film is packed with inside jokes, clever references to the X-Men franchise, and plenty of Easter eggs that make the experience even richer.In the end, Deadpool and Wolverine's partnership is a stroke of genius. It's chaotic, funny, and full of the action-packed sequences that fans love, while also giving us a pairing that's as endearing as it is entertaining. Ryan Reynolds brings his signature humor and irreverence as Deadpool, while Hugh Jackman delivers the gritty, no-nonsense Wolverine we've come to know and love. Together, they've created a superhero team-up that's unforgettable, proving that sometimes, the most unlikely pairs can make for the best stories. This film is a must-watch for any fan of superhero movies, offering laughs, action, and heart in equal measure. It's the perfect blend of madness, mayhem, and magic.",Helpful,•,3,5,H0kv5,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur119939766/?ref_=tturv_usr_148_t,3-Oct-24,

This third installment of Deadpool franchise is an absolute shocker and nostalgic film. At least to those who love the X-Men franchise and other Marvel movies such as Daredevil, Elektra and Fantastic Four. You'll get to see old characters with their original casts. It's a cameo galore! Oh, the nostalgia! So lovely and melancholic! The supervillain in this movie is still related to X-Men plot, in a sense. So technically, this movie is also an X-Men franchise. And just like the first and second Deadpool movie, this movie is filled with Ryan Reynold's dark, witty and inappropriate dirty jokes.

A lot has happened in the MCU in that time - not as much in the Fox-verse - but it's almost instantly comfortable and fun being back in Wade Wilson/Deadpool (Reynolds)'s world. The film does a great job of both making fun of both the MCU and Fox films, whilst remaining true to the Deadpool and Wolverine/Logan (Jackman) characters and simultaneously integrating them into the MCU via the Time Variance Authority (if you haven't watched both seasons of 'Loki', highly recommended and will help with some of the multiverse aspects).That said, this still works well as a standalone unwilling-buddy-journey film, with Logan being a curmudgeon with no hope and Wade being a defeated optimist trying to save his friends. Wade, obviously, does most of the talking, with Reynolds banter as fast and dirty as ever, but Jackman holds his own. Cassandra Nova (Corrin) and Paradox (Macfadyen) are good as the not-always-sure-they're-100%-villains. The fight scenes, especially between the 2 of them, are fast and fun. But this is still an MA-rated film - there's lots of blood throughout! The score and soundtrack are great, with some very famous songs used in unique and funny ways throughout.There's so many nods/references to comics and past films from both studios that I won't mention any here. Except that Peter (Delaney) is back and has a few great moments. Needless to say, as a fan that's been following these characters since I was a teenager, there's not much more I could ask for from this film. It's maybe not as good as 'Logan', or the original 'Deadpool', but it certainly delivers a fun and emotional journey for both characters, with enough jokes to not get too serious, enough action to make it a blockbuster and enough heart to not let it descend into caricature.",Helpful,•,19,18,gavinp9,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur21319675/?ref_=tturv_usr_152_t,24-Jul-24,

And that is where this movie loses some of its spark. The fact that dead characters are now able to be brought back to life as well as the multi-verse angle, basically means there is zero at stake anymore in these so called universes. The narrative is an obvious team up against a bad guy/girl and the universe or universes are universally under threat etc etc.While there is action galore the fact nobody really dies or can die means there is little at steak when it comes to the violence. So instead they have to try and make the violence more stylish and in some cases played for laughs. But for some reason the fights seemed quite flat and emotionless. Another problem is the cameos. Sure one or two surprises were there, but for the most part I was thinking who is he/she? How are they relevant and what exactly am I missing. Because this is definitely a comic book nerd movie and unless you are in that demographic you won't get any of these references. Even the song choices this time aren't as good. This film is quite the mess, with too many faces, too many pointless punch ups, no real tension and Ryan's cheeky dialogue is starting to grate. Its an ok superhero movie, but really the bar has dropped since infinity war and that is really where it should have ended. I'm not even sure what ""universe"" this is supposed to be but they should have left Wolverine buried.",Helpful,•,2,3,torrascotia,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur77948093/?ref_=tturv_usr_153_t,1-Oct-24,
6,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9927314/?ref_=tturv_perm_154,Fan Driven Story is Solid Entertainment,"I have had mixed reactions with the Deadpool movies. The first one I thought was fun but a little too snarky. The second one I felt was a better story and less snarky. Here, Deadpool continues to break the forth wall, and makes jabs at Disney, seemingly aimed for the social media community. Self deprecation is always a virtue. Here, the movie goes straight up and acknowledges that Logan died in his last movie. Audiences seemed to agree it was time to move on, having been the cornerstone of the X men franchise for 17 years. It has been about seven years since Logan was released, six years since the last Deadpool. Long enough to have given this intense over-the-top character a breather. As for the return of Wolverine, there always seems to be the ability for Hollywood to convince both talent and audiences to make one more trip around the race track. For example, you had Matt Damon doing a fourth Bourne film after calling it quits.What I liked about this film is that it made sure audiences were being entertained. I also think Deadpool's motivation was well established. Wolverine appears via the multiverse, which plays heavily into the plot. Deadpool apologises for the MCU overusing the multi-universe trope. Hugh Jackman no doubt is married to the Wolverine persona. His presence on screen brings more gravitas to the proceedings, even in the goofy world of Deadpool. But that is also because Deadpool gets a little more serious in this outing, and the gags a little less frequent.There was a lot to like with the established characters from other movies and tv series being intertwined. I don't read comics, and people like me are required to pay extra close attention to the exposition. For the real fanboys, this movie is like a checklist of favourite comic moments (evidently). These moments provide a fresh new plot point, continuing the momentum. During the quiet points, Jackman has a chance to emote probably more than any other Wolverine film. It works, and helps to tie in the multiverse premise. I can't say the same for the Wade Wilson character. I guess it has been that long that I kind of lost track of some of his demons. But also since he wears a mask that completely covers his face for a good portion of this film, it is hard to delve into them, at least with any real depth.The third act felt a little formulaic, something that has been plaguing Marvel movies of late (like the over-the-top CGI in the third act of Black Widow). Not that it was really a letdown, but just very familiar beats. I liked the energy and attitude of this Marvel outing, as the superhero burnout phenomena continues. The six year gap since the last Deadpool helped in this case, along with a bravura performance by Hugh Jackman.Despite the superlatives I give for this franchise, I still only give this film a 6 out of 10. Just a little above average. I reserve higher ratings for films that really stand out. I give a lot of films 6 stars in which there is competent filmmaking, and a watchable story. But they normally don't transcend the genre and fall into a well established formula.",Helpful,•,3,5,kgprophet,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1158617/?ref_=tturv_usr_154_t,29-Jul-24,

I watched previous two Deadpool films and other Marvel film's in its original language but my friend recommended me to watch this movie in Hindi Dub and I must say dubbing was actually very good. Hindi Dialogues perfectly match in comedic situation and audience laughing all the time in theatre.Deadpool & Wolverine is an explosive, hilarious, and action-packed ride that perfectly blends the irreverent humor of Deadpool with the brooding intensity of Wolverine. This film is a testament to the power of chemistry, as Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman share an undeniable on-screen camaraderie that elevates the entire experience.The film masterfully balances its comedic and action-packed elements. Deadpool's signature fourth-wall-breaking antics and witty one-liners are as sharp as ever, while Wolverine's raw power and berserker rage provide a thrilling counterbalance. The action sequences are choreographed with precision and are visually stunning, but it's the comedic timing and banter between the two protagonists that truly sets this film apart.While the film pays homage to the characters' comic book origins, it also manages to offer fresh perspectives on both Deadpool and Wolverine. We see a more vulnerable side to Wolverine, while Deadpool's chaotic energy is dialed up to eleven. The dynamic between the two characters is constantly evolving, keeping the audience engaged and entertained.The fight sequences in Deadpool & Wolverine are a breathtaking blend of brutal efficiency and comic book absurdity. Wolverine's feral, animalistic fighting style is juxtaposed with Deadpool's chaotic, unpredictable approach, creating a visually stunning and exhilarating spectacle. The cinematography during these sequences is nothing short of exceptional. Rapid cuts, slow-motion, and dynamic camera angles capture the intensity and chaos of the fights, immersing the audience in the action. The use of handheld cameras adds a gritty, realistic feel, while the incorporation of Deadpool's fourth-wall-breaking commentary provides a unique and humorous twist.The music score for Deadpool & Wolverine is a masterclass in balancing contrasting tones. The action sequences are accompanied by a pulsating, adrenaline-fueled score that perfectly complements the on-screen mayhem. The use of heavy metal and industrial elements adds to the raw intensity of the fights. On the other hand, during the comedic moments, the score is lighthearted and playful, often incorporating unexpected musical choices that enhance the humor.The cinematography in Deadpool & Wolverine is a character in itself. The film boasts a vibrant, comic book-inspired visual style that is both visually appealing and functionally effective. The use of color is bold and striking, with the red and yellow color palette of Deadpool's costume serving as a focal point.While the film is largely a triumph, there are a few minor issues. The plot, while entertaining, is somewhat predictable at times. Additionally, some of the comedic gags might not land for everyone, as the humor is sometimes crude and irreverent.Overall, Deadpool & Wolverine is a must-see for fans of the characters and action-comedy genre. It's a film that delivers on all fronts, with a perfect blend of humor, action, and heart.",Helpful,•,5,3,chiragrathod19,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur155643091/?ref_=tturv_usr_155_t,5-Aug-24,
8,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9924116/?ref_=tturv_perm_156,Deadpool levels up with a black belt in Karen. 80%,"Expect the usual mix of 'realism' undercut by copious amounts of breaking the fourth wall which constantly reminds you that you are watching actors act in a film which has a commercial imperative. Suspend disbelief then have have the rope holding you up severed. Rinse and repeat, to good effect. This makes the Marvel universe (MCU) cross-promotion not just palatable but also enjoyable. Any cynicism by the audience is anticipated by Deadpool (played by Ryan Reynolds) and it is he who lands the first blow.Not having watched any trailers for this film beforehand, I went to the cinema without any advanced knowledge of what happens. I'd already forgotten the previous Deadpool films but I've reviewed them both here and liked the first one more than it's sequel. This might be my new favourite in this franchise.I had seen clips or read somewhere how Reynolds was mindful of not tarnishing the memory of Wolverine (played by Hugh Jackman) as seen in that superhero's last solo outing. I hadn't even remembered that Wolverine had died there but the flashback to this scene in this Deadpool film reminded me that I think I've seen that film...and given it a good review on this site. Fans of Wolverine concerned with this issue have a Pyrrhic victory on that front, in a manner of speaking.It looks like I've missed a few new developments in the MCU, especially with regard to the TVA (Time Variance Authority). They seem to be a temporal equivalent to parking inspectors or ""grey ghosts"", as they are known in Melbourne, Australia. Maybe. I won't give away the plot but it is up to Deadpool to save the universe. Mind, Deadpool will often tell you that he isn't the type of person to the save the world. And the world is a bit smaller than the universe.What's appealing about this sequel is that it seems that Deadpool often appears to address me, personally, a casual fan of some of the MCU. He's like me in that often he doesn't have a clue who some of these other superheroes are. He'll ask them to introduce themselves, which is helpful to both of us.The first big 'reveal' of a potential ally for D & W in The Void drew a blank from me, until he did his superhero thing and I could place him (I could dimly remember that character from a rather uninspired film from prior to the MCU, some many decades ago). In other words, I couldn't put a name to the character but the character rang a bell.Another time I was more on the ball. A black character appears in The Void and I could pick the character, I felt, without the need for an introduction. Reading the actor's name in the end credits was a surprise...it would seem that AI was used to represent him, along the lines of what was done for Harrison Ford in some scenes of the last Indiana Jones film. Basically, the look of this character triggered my recall of him from a film that I don't really remember, having seen it many decades ago.Back to Deadpool being helpful to casual viewers, there's an amusing scene where he pointedly says what I'm thinking when a superhero is speaking English in a thick French accent (""thick"" along the lines of that Spanish character in the sitcom Blackadder).As for Wolverine, well, Jackman has a chest like a barrel in this film, which makes me wonder whether he has kept in shape since his last turn as Wolverine or he got into shape for this film. Not being immersed in all things Marvel, the significance of the pairing of Deadpool and Wolverine was no doubt wasted on me. Personally speaking, a pairing more likely to make me cream in my jeans would be Deadpool and Tom Baker era Doctor Who. Both characters are mouthy, irreverent and go about saving the world. They just do it in vastly different ways. Deadpool can't do it without spilling Olympic-size swimming pool amounts of blood and gore. Lots of people die. However, Doctor Who does have a particular set of skills well adapted to the direction the MCU has gone with this film and elsewhere. Having AI do some of the VFX for the representation of Tom Baker would be ideal too.Other match-ups would no doubt infuriate Marvel nerds due to how anti-climactic they are.This was a fun and enjoyable film. I could probably watch it again for pleasure, not just because I often missed lines of dialogue here, for whatever reason, whilst in the cinema. Blu-ray would be my choice on that front, just so that I could enable subtitles when the dialogue isn't clear.If you like jokey, fourth wall breaking stories with plenty of blood and your favourite superhero frequently French kissing an ugly dog, then this is the film for you. When it was attempting to be serious, it did pull that off with feeling.Notes to self:In the end credits, two people are mentioned...Len Wein as a ""significant contributor"" to the X-Men and Raymond Chan, who is described as ""an anchor"", in the sense intended by its use in the film.Towards the end of the film, I was thinking that it would end with a plot hole but it didn't.That dramatic finale was very nicely done, in how it misdirected our expectations.Mad Max is referenced in the film and some of the scenes made me wonder how it could have so similar transport to the recent Furiosa film, which they presumably would not have had access to when they were making this.The use of snippets of existing songs got ridiculous towards the end. It's as if they realised that they needed to meet a quota for a double album soundtrack for the film and had to get cracking in the last few minutes to do that. .Rated MA15+ in Australia.

And fun, of which the movie has plenty. It's true that over the years, people have grown accustomed to Ryan Reynolds' style of humor, which since the popularity of the first ""Deadpool"" movie, has followed him around into every other movie he makes. But there's always something special when Ryan delivers the same obnoxious 'c*ck-and-b*lls' jokes wearing that loveable red suit.What convinced us all to go to the cinemas and check this movie out after the years of being sick of superhero movies however, is not Deadpool in and of itself, but the addition of Hugh Jackman's Wolverine to the mix. It's a character so beloved and one we can almost never picture anyone else in, and this movie is further proof as to why. It's a pairing that we knew would always work out well, and unsurprisingly it does. It's the banter between Deadpool and Logan that makes this movie as fun and enjoyable as it is, and credit to both actors whose chemistry was the best thing about this movie.All that being said, we're once again back to the inevitable Marvel problem of having a paper thin script which has the now banal world ending stakes it always has. It's something that has been overplayed so much that it even makes a Deadpool movie somewhat tedious. It's a Deadpool movie, so sure you're about to expect some silliness sprinkled around, but where you don't want to see it is in the blueprint of the script. And unfortunately, that's where it is, with the laziness and the lethargy of Marvel's writing department sticking around like a sore thumb.It's a movie full of banter and cameos and while that makes for an amazing theater-going experience, it's not enough to warrant longevity. The cameos are surprising, but only the first time you watch it, and that probably makes this movie the weakest of the three Deadpool movies. All criticism aside though, it's a movie worth checking out for sure while the hype is still on, because it's not going to be as fun once it's out on digital, when everyone knows what surprises to expect.",Helpful,•,3,1,isaacsundaralingam,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur40254989/?ref_=tturv_usr_157_t,9-Aug-24,

In the midst of the onslaught of jokes and violence, are well-handled tributes and well-placed Easter eggs and references. It tells its story well enough while making room for lots of fan service. It's indeed a real crowd pleaser, which is what it most wants to be.For those who have issues with multiverse movies, don't worry, Deadpool and Wolverine is a Deadpool movie before it's a multiverse movie. I don't think people go see these movies for their amazing stories. People want to laugh and have fun. So if you liked the first two movies you'll have a blast with this third installment. The action is wild and exciting. I was hanging on every word of dialogue as I didn't want to miss a single joke or reference.The movie is so self-aware and just what Marvel needed at this time. I like how they humorously acknowledge instances where the MCU and the genre as a whole have fallen short. Deadpool speaks for the fans. It shows us that the writers are at least aware of what the people have been saying.Ryan Reynolds and Deadpool know how to create a good time, but I admit I was most excited about Hugh Jackman and Wolverine. It was so good to see him back as the character, but even more comic book accurate than we've seen him before.I loved that they managed to give us humor and heart with this movie. Marvel has given us a few examples of how a movie can be ridiculous and hilarious and yet somehow get serious and sentimental without it feeling jarring or out of place.

It's a mix of laughs, action, and surprising heart that mostly hits the mark.Reynolds and Jackman have undeniable chemistry. Reynolds is in his element, firing off jokes like a machine gun. But it's Jackman who steals some scenes with a vulnerability we don't often see from Logan. Their very mature-rated banter is gold, and it carries the movie through some of its weaker moments.The action is a rollercoaster. Some sequences are pure adrenaline, with the 3D adding a cool dimension. Others feel a bit too chaotic. But when you've got two guys who can cut through steel with their bare hands, you expect some explosions.The humour is spot on. Deadpool's fourth-wall breaking antics are as sharp as ever, and the movie is packed with funny pop culture references. But it's the buddy comedy vibes between Deadpool and Wolverine that really shine. You can't help but laugh at their constant bickering.It's not perfect, though. The story is pretty standard superhero fare, and there are a few slow parts. Plus, while 3D is cool and increases the feeling of immersion, in my opinion, it's not necessary to enjoy the movie.

Both of them have excellent antagonistic chemistry. The contrast between Jackman's serious performance and Reynolds's jokey performance is incredibly fun to watch. What made previous Deadpool movies great is that while it was primarily a comedy, it had a lot of heart too. This is still the case here. Deadpool's love for Vanessa and his friends is still here and despite his stupid antics, it is very clear he is serious about them. Wolverine has immense guilt and Jackman's excellent performance conveys the pain perfectly. Both have great character arcs that are honestly very heart-warming and satisfying.On that note, the comedy continues to be hilarious! You still get the crude and dirty jokes, the fun meta ones, the downright silly ones. All of which got a chuckle out of me. What I appreciate most though is that the movie doesn't shy away from jokes that point fun at Disney or the current state of the MCU. The movie being part of the multiverse saga did worry me about it being a cameo fest. There are definitely moments with short appearances of individuals but there are also some proper appearances. Some of these ""cameos"" feel more like a supporting character. The movie also has a killer soundtrack that is used very effectively. There is a great sequence with Madonna and NSYNC that still stick in my mind. There are also some very entertaining action sequences that are well-choreographed. There is an excellent one in the intro and a unique one involving a car.Yet, for some reason, one of the action sequences in the beginning of the 3rd act is just weirdly bad. This one particular action set piece had such awful cuts and shaky camera that it was nearly impossible to tell what was going on. It is weird as every action set piece before was terrific and even the one after is amazing. None of them had shaky camera, except that one particular one. The Deadpool movies have had a lot of jokes that feel like you would need a bit of knowledge of things that occurred in the real world to understand. In this entry, there are definitely a lot more of these types of jokes. I understood all of it which is why it made me laugh but I was watching the movie with someone else and the jokes flew over their head. It's not a big problem but it is something to note, especially if you plan on watching this with another person.One of the weakest aspects of this movie compared to previous entries is the story. The stakes are higher than it ever has been with the whole universe of Deadpool being at stake. The problem is that we don't ever really feel it. There is no tension, suspense or urgency to the oncoming doom. Deadpool and Wolverine don't ever feel like they're in any rush. The multiverse setting also results in what feels like nothing is truly ever at stake. Characters could die but it never really feels like their death means anything. It also introduces more rules to the multiverse and it just raises so many questions. Despite this being a Deadpool movie in the MCU, the story is very inconsequential and doesn't really add anything. I also find the villain, Cassandra Nova, to be quite dull. They have cool powers and Emma Corrin gives a lively performance as the character. However, the villain's motive is very weak and they are not given enough depth for us to care one bit about them.Overall, Deadpool is Marvel Jesus. After a lot of stinkers from MCU movies, we finally get a genuinely great one. It doesn't taint the legacy left behind by Fox X-Men movies. If anything, Deadpool & Wolverine is a celebration of those past movies. It respectfully honours our nostalgia while also giving us hope for the future of MCU movies.

Deadpool & Wolverine is an unexpected treat, especially for someone like me who thought Hugh Jackman had permanently hung up his claws after Logan. I remember thinking that it would take a miracle to get him back as Wolverine, but leave it to newly crowned Marvel Jesus Ryan Reynolds and the sheer force of his passion for Deadpool to make it happen. Watching these two together on screen is pure joy; their bromance is undeniable, and it translates so well into their performances.This film proves once again that when the right people are behind a project, comic book movies can still feel fresh and exciting. Reynolds' relentless passion for Deadpool, which willed the character into existence back in 2016, now brings Wolverine back into the fold. The film doesn't shy away from what made Deadpool such a hit-despite joining the MCU, the character isn't watered down. In fact, the film takes every opportunity to mercilessly skewer Disney, Marvel, and even a few rival studios. The violence and profanity are as brutal as ever, which is honestly a relief; it stays true to what fans love.As a fan, I also appreciate the cavalcade of cameos. It seems like every other film these days is crammed with nostalgic appearances, but this one actually makes those characters earn their place in the story. It's fun without feeling forced, which is a rare feat.If there's one weak spot, it's the villain, who doesn't quite live up to the standard set by the rest of the film. But then again, that's something I've come to expect from Marvel, so it didn't really dampen my overall enjoyment.All in all, Deadpool & Wolverine is a blast from start to finish. It's a movie made by people who clearly love these characters as much as the fans do, and it's loads of fun to watch. If you're a fan of either character, this is one you won't want to miss.FORMAT: CinemaVIDEO: 10.0

This makes for more comedic complexity than in the prior films. The jokes and the story poke fun at the MCU, Disney, (the former Twentieth Century) Fox, the multiverse, and the Fox superhero films of yore. Along with somewhere bad taste sexual jokes and bad taste bodily jokes about violence and anatomy being splattered around as much as the fake/CGI blood there is a good ambiance of fun funny.This is a crowd pleaser. The characters are written to give the actors a few moments of actual acting to do whilst mainly keeping it cool in their character default. It's a light touch which usually stays light and only occasionally becomes a bit heavy going or cloying.There are some silly sci-fi superhero hijinks - nothing too serious or interesting - and some decent effects and action sequences although the action is where 'Deadpool & Wolverine' actually seems weakest: the action is less impressive than the well weighted writing, the easy going acting, the special effects design, or the light direction style.I rate a well satisfied 7/10; for me the best of the trio of cinematic Deadpool: accessible and easy and funny.",Helpful,•,1,2,daniewhite-1,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur16619373/?ref_=tturv_usr_171_t,8-Aug-24,

Their banter is still sharp, and the chemistry is undeniable, but it feels like we've been here before. It's like they reheated the leftovers from their past roles and slapped a new label on it.The movie is a wild mix of blood, jokes, and a plot that barely holds together. It's fun as hell, don't get me wrong, but it's also kind of like riding a rollercoaster that's mostly made of old parts from other rides. You'll laugh, you'll cringe, and you might even cheer a few times, but by the end, you're not really sure if it was the ride itself or just the thrill of seeing these two back in action.Overall, ""Deadpool & Wolverine"" does the job, but it's not the game-changer it thinks it is. It's like ordering the usual from your favorite takeout spot-you know exactly what you're getting, and it's just fine.

I have to admit I was hyped for it, I enjoyed it but I thought it could've been greater...Let me start with what I really enjoyed about the movie, as always it doesn't take itself too serious as it shouldn't, Deadpool was always a comedic approach to the super hero genre filled with meta commentary and jokes targeting real life situations, the peak of 4th wall breaking, I feel this continues to be the strength of the film and they manage to keep the jokes funny and most importantly fresh!The fact that both these actors, Ryan and Hugh, seemingly have been born to play these roles makes it also a really pleasant experience, they do it perfectly and their chemistry, most likely also due to their real life friendship, shines on the big screen.I also really enjoyed the cameos and the references, regardless of some people calling it fan service, I don't see why that's a bad thing, I feel that if you are going to be ridiculous about the Multiverse there's no better movie than a Deadpool movie to do that.It had some really funny scenes, good action sequences and fights and the soundtrack was really something else.And one thing I was surprised was, regardless if you find the plot interesting or not, they actually nailed the way they set the story, how they managed to bring Wolverine back, adding the TVA into the mix to explain some of the plot decisions, I felt that for a movie that doesn't take itself serious it was a really solid explanation of context.With all of this being said, I did have a few issues with it and the reason why I won't rate it higher;

6,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9937124/?ref_=tturv_perm_175,More Deadpool than Marvel,"Deadpool 3 is nothing more but pure entertaining fun. It is low on calories or relevance but it´s been a while since I had fun or even rated a Marvel movie high. This is a movie that can feel almost nonsensical to make without much purpose in the overall presentation, since it feels like it wants to be a Marvel extravaganza but ends up being just another Deadpool movie in its own little world and continuity. I hope this movie isn´t in the Marvel canon since that would have some bad implications for the future of the already crumbling Marvel cinematic universe, but is what it is a harmless entertaining dictation.With the thread of his universe being destroyed, Deadpool is forced to find a replacement for his Wolverine, this leads to a fight between them, the multiverse police and the fate of the Fox legacy.First off, this movie is interesting in its approach to Disney/Marvel acquiring the Fox licences back. The fate of the Fox license are still in a weird echo chamber to me, since this movie aloes to the Fox movies and the overall death of Fox, but at the same time celebrates and shows what Fox did to these licences, good and bad. You have probably head of a lot of cameos in this movie, yes go in blind to have the most fun. But after a movie like this that feels like it´s in its own separate universe away from the Marvel canon, I actually don´t see the point as to even bring it up, other than to make jokes and really hit home, yes this is Disney now. The credits even has a salute to the former Fox era of Marvel movies and I must say, it brings this sour taste in your mouth with Disney now holding licences like X-men and many more, and it´s going to be interesting what the future will bring.Speaking of the humour I felt the joke ratio was good and this movie got a lot of laughs out of me. The meta humour works and the movie gets away worth way more than I thought it would, but at the same time that should have been predictable, since we all predicted we would get a muttered Deadpool under Disney. But I laughed a lot here and this is carried by Ryan Reynolds performance that definitely is a huge carrying factor of this movie and the Deadpool franchise as a whole. There is a lot of great and fun performances here and Hugh Jackman also delivers a string and emotional performance, when he is given the mic. I feel like Deadpool is the one holding it the most and that can make Wolverine feel a bit absent at times in a movie bearing his name.This is a movie for the fans of Deadpool, Fox and Marvel, not much more. This movie is really light on plot and relevance, but can´t you say that of most modern comedies? That is of course not an excuse, but to really set your expectations as to what you are watching will help you enjoy the movie more. This is not the next movie in the Marvel pantheon, hopefully, this is just another Deadpool comedy movie and in that regard it delivers.There is some fun ideas in terms of action and in general the action feels good here. The fights between characters are fun and having Deadpool and Wolverine duking it out, two nearly immortal beings really lowers the stakes but set up for fun things to do where blood can fly freely. This movie added a lot of blood and from the amazing opening that you no doubt got spoiled if you are on TikTok, the action is set to be fun and the final fighting extravaganza is so well done. The action is filmed sloppy most of the time though with too many cuts and some really poor CG is present most of the movie. The shot of our two heroes jumping out of a bus looks absolutely atrocious.This movie uses music a lot and there are some fun and memorable needle drops here. They are sometimes annoyingly interrupted for no reason and the move has a bit too much licensed music for my liking. Tarantino really ruined using songs in film, while he knows how to do it, he created an annoying trend that most directors don´t know how to do right. Again this movie is mixed with its music use, but mostly it´s entertain9ng and well done.Deadpool 3 is a mixed bag in terms of what it is and what to get out of it. Am I enjoying myself and laughing? Yes, is this an epic Marvel movie? Not really does it have heart, purpose or characters? Debateable, but I am stuck thinking, this was fun, entertaining and normally comedies have a hard time getting to me, so I can only applaud when a movie is successful of that.",Helpful,•,3,5,mickeythechamp,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur52112075/?ref_=tturv_usr_175_t,4-Aug-24,

5,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw10027673/?ref_=tturv_perm_179,Disappointing and overrated with a terrible villain,"I should have known this would be a disappointment. I was too excited by the prospect of Jackman returning and the relatively high rating. But I didn't like Deadpool 2 much and Deadpool & Wolverine continues with a similar tone and even worse weaknesses.This is clearly not a serious movie. I get that. But that comes with a trade-off. By being less serious, Deadpool 3 has more freedom to do whatever crazy, silly, ""offensive"", incongruous stuff the filmmakers want to. But that also sets the bar higher. If you can do anything, you better do some cool things. If you're gonna go crazy, you better go full crazy. But this movie really feels lazy, uninspired and as if it's pulling its punches.Reynolds and Jackman are likeable in the main roles, but they don't have much to do. They're both practically immortal and end up shooting and stabbing each-other hundreds of times. It gets old quickly. And it has no weight or implications. The actors were able to milk many of the lines, so I did laugh at times, but it leaves an empty feeling afterwards. Contrast that with Infinity War where the comedy has more weight because of the desperation of the situation. The comedy truly is relief, but in a comedy movie, jokes need to be bigger, better or more varied.A movie is only as good as its villain and Deadpool 3's villain is awful. Some bald lady doing a performance which would feel below average at a high school play. She has zero charisma or presence. Just this lame intense eye thing and waving her hands around. Her powers seem to be arbitrary and she doesn't consistently use them. Her motivation is also unclear and uninteresting. No idea why they got this actress.The cameos were mildly exciting at first but largely turn out to be gimmicky. Many characters are brought back only to do absolutely nothing at all. I'm reminded of Sheeva in Mortal Kombat: Annihilation. Sure, you get your cheap laugh, but then what? Several characters are killed unceremoniously with no real wit, shock or meaning. Compared to what could have been done, it's really lazy and disappointing. It feels like Family Guy flashbacks - cheap jokes and nothing more.Of all the worlds in the MCU, this movie seems to build on the world of the Loki TV show more than anything else. A show with no consistent rules and several mediocre actors. Again, of all the things you could do, given such freedom, this is super lame. It feels like they knew they needed time travel and/or multiverse shenanigans to make the plot work and so chose Loki for that reason. Again, it's just lazy - a choice made for convenience rather than passion or potential.There is a relatively serious subplot concerning Wolverine but it seems like things were cut out - we never seem to learn the key facts or context. I thought at least there might be some gravitas or insight with that part of the movie, but it led nowhere.Reynolds is pretty good at breaking the 4th wall, but that's not enough to save an otherwise weak movie. And just because you joke about X, doesn't mean you can get away with X, whatever X might be. For example, sloppy multiverse shenanigans. Oh, we're joking about it too, so that means it's okay. Not really.Channing Tatum was completely miscast in his role. His accent wasn't too bad, but he's way too bulky and just not a good actor overall and not for comedy. One cameo was pretty cool, including his grey streaks of hair, even though I haven't seen any of his movies. Others felt ironic, like look at this obscure character you'd probably forgotten about. Maybe it's a bit nostalgic, but there's a reason certain movies and characters were unpopular.Every step of the way, the movie goes for the obvious, easy, dumb joke, rather than anything risky or more deeply creative. For example, part of the movie clearly evokes Mad Max, which got me a bit excited. Are we gonna get some over-the-top Mad Max style action? What other movies will this pay homage to? But no. It does nothing with it. Here's a character with some history. But let's not delve into that or pay anything off, let's just kill them.Aside from anything else, the filmmaking itself is mediocre. The action is generic, the comedy is generic, several actors are below average, if that. There's too much slow motion which makes boring scenes even more so. Reynolds and Jackman deserve better.And the violence, while generally inoffensive, is nevertheless gratuitous and mean-spirited. At times, it seems the movie has nothing to offer BUT violence, and not very stylised violence at that. Just the same things again and again, done far more effectively in other movies, in terms of VFX, choreography, stakes, style, etc.It's also disappointing to see some characters from the first movie do nothing at all. What's the point? The first one was better and the sequels have gone the wrong way. Nolan's Batman trilogy is funnier while also vastly more original, masterful, challenging and dark. The best MCU movies have much better action, acting and humour.

Ever since Disney acquired Fox, I think it's safe to say nothing has been done with its hero properties, and Disney/Marvel has been hurting.So does Deadpool have what it takes to reinvigorate some much needed life back into the MCU? Well, let's be honest regardless of how well this film does in theaters. Disney/Marvel needs more than one movie to come back to life.With that being said, Deadpool & Wolverine is perhaps the summer hero blockbuster the MCU needs right now.Is this the best film in the MCU? I would say no, but it's definitely better than recent Marvel projects. Deadpool & Wolverine is simply put a fun time at the theaters it gives us more of the merc with the mouth and lots of blood and action. Then stack that with Hugh Jackman in his return to Wolverine, but also put on top of that cameos galore featuring some great Marvel characters of yesteryear and this very easily can be seen as an instant fan favorite.Unfortunately, that's all this film has to offer. It's like they said let's make a movie based on nothing more than fan service. Not to say, fan service is bad, but a movie should have more than just fanfare. The story is shockingly shallow, and ultimately, I found it boring. The villain or ""villains"" were also boring. Then the charm of all this fan service wore thin surprisingly quick. When around every corner is supposed to be fanfare for the sake of fanfare, then those moments lose impact and magic.This whole movie felt like I was touring a ""museum"" (and yes pun intended) of Marvel characters past and present. In the end, though, it was like having a super annoying fan sitting next to you saying ""hey you remember that character... hey, you remember this character?"" All I wanted to say was yes. I remember these characters. Can we do something else now.As much fun as it is to see these characters on screen again, I'd rather visit their respective films than have them being used for what amounts to commodities for ticket sales.While Deadpool & Wolverine isn't bad, it could have been so much better, but hopefully, this will be a turning point for Disney/Marvel, and the MCU would have breathed in some new life.

Logan's return was hotly debated beforehand and I'd say this one fits the bill. Wolverine remains the best, at least this Wolverine on film. Ryan Reynolds, as we all know, is now completely fused with the character, but his alter ego only works in a direct portrayal. Maybe it's the mask. Of course, there are also some things to criticise.

It had two villains: Cassandra Nova and Paradox from the TVA. Cassandra's powers were intimidating and she had a truly scary presence, although I wish the MCU would do more with her character rather than potentially letting us down.

Disney pullled no punches with their first Deadpool movie and the cameos are both brilliant and simply amazing. Now I won't spoil who shows up in this movie and you will just have to watch for yourself to see. The action is violent, gory, and in your face. The chemistry between Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman is perfect. I really can't wait to see what Disney does with the next Deadpool film. The film is about 2 hours long and I laughed pretty much the whole time through. Now I will say it certainly helps to have seen the previous Deadpool movies plus also watching previous Marvel films, otherwise you might be a little lost.

7,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9923590/?ref_=tturv_perm_192,As Fun As It Is Flawed,"Deadpool and Wolverine definitely presented a lot of interesting story possibilities as a superhero film but also a lot of ideas that left me sceptical at best. Put that on top of marvels recent inconsistency and the fact that the Deadpool movies thus far haven't really worked for me meant I was very much going in with a lot of nervous anticipation. It's an uneven ride for sure with a lot of execution that didn't always work for me but it's a very enjoyable experience with a lot of wholesome character moments that I wasn't sure it would give me.The humour in these Deadpool movies doesn't always work for me but I have to say I found this film to be pretty hilarious when all was said and done. It feels so self aware in all the right ways when it comes to integrating this character into the MCU. Ryan Reynolds continues to prove that he's perfect in this role and as someone who grew up on the Fox X-Men movies I got such a kick out of seeing Hugh Jackman as Wolverine in this movie. Despite the fact that I have a bit of a tricky relationship with Logan I thought it was the right note to end that character on and I was concerned about the idea of this movie bringing him back. Thankfully my fears were alleviated very early on and I thought the way in which they integrated him into this story was almost perfect. His arc here isn't as strong as I wanted it to be however and really neither is the story.I think that's in large part because of the cameos that everyone is so looking forwarding to seeing in this movie. Don't get me wrong there were plenty that brought out my inner comic fan but I will be honest and say that they did lose their impact on me after a while. It doesn't really feel like they took full advantage of the multiverse concept so very quickly it just felt like a series of flat reveals designed to get applause in a theatre. The villains here are also pretty weak which isn't new for the MCU but I did frustrate me a bit more than usual here. I think it's just because of the great actors playing them who give it their all but it never really felt like the script matched their efforts. With the Cassandra Nova character I actually thought there was an opportunity for a cameo with some real emotional weight but that moment never really came so the character as a whole just felt really underdeveloped.A lot has been made of the fact that this is the MCU's first R-Rated movie and I have to say it had a mixed effect on me. Shawn Levy is a really good director, I've liked both his other movies with Ryan Reynolds, and his style really fits in well with the Deadpool tone. It's as gory as you'd expect with really great action but not really one set piece that stood out to me. I just thought it was kind of childish in how it incorporated all of the profanity and the gore to the point where it just became eye rolling for me. It just felt like they were looking for any excuse to drop an f-bomb and it just felt ridiculous very quickly and like they were just going for shock value. I didn't think this with the first 2 Deadpool movies and with this being new territory for the MCU they've still got a ways to go to perfecting it.Deadpool and Wolverine is an undeniable fun ride with moments that were equal parts satisfying as they were frustrating. The cameos were better inserted than I expected but never as exciting as Levy thought they were. It's exciting to see Jackman as Wolverine one last time (I hope) and I did leave the most excited I've ever been to see where the Deadpool character is going next. For me, it wasn't the return to form for the MCU I was expecting but I'd be lying if I didn't say this provide a lot of moments that reminded me of this universe at its peak. That's something which leaves me with hope that they're slowly but surely heading in the right direction.",Helpful,•,1,1,cdjh-81125,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur65144138/?ref_=tturv_usr_192_t,27-Jul-24,

Raising it's eyebrow to the idea that every world has a hero that is fundamental to its survival. Hence the search for a new Logan.But no. It doesn't. Just like all the multiverse movies that came before, it skips around abstract worlds, introducing unbelievable characters and situations, and destroying any possible drama.But that's probably not why you watch a Deadpool movie. You watch it for the jokes, the smut and the fourth-wall breaks. Of which there are plenty. This installment also has a long list of cameo appearances, none of which disappoint, with a handful being true highlights of the film (I won't name names to avoid any spoilers).Hugh Jackman plays Wolverine straight, with lots of slice-n-dice fight sequences. But he is definitely the support act rather than the co-lead. This film is all about Ryan Reynolds - or at least, whoever wears the red and black costume.Back to the ""story"", Matthew McFadyen is OK as the first British baddie. Emma Corrin is really poor as the second British baddie and never manages to find the right tone.To sum up, the laughs are there, the action is good but repetitive, and the story isn't even worth trying to make sense of.

Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman have both become synonymous with their respective roles, bringing unique and compelling performances that have resonated deeply with audiences.Ryan Reynolds' Deadpool is known for his irreverent humor, breaking the fourth wall, and his anti-hero charm. Reynolds' portrayal is consistently sharp, witty, and perfectly captures the essence of the Merc with a Mouth. Hugh Jackman's Wolverine, on the other hand, has become iconic over the years, blending gruff intensity with a deep sense of vulnerability. Jackman's embodiment of Logan is both fierce and poignant, offering a depth to the character that has made him a beloved figure in the superhero genre.Their on-screen chemistry is electric, blending Deadpool's chaotic, over-the-top antics with Wolverine's stoic, no-nonsense demeanor. This dynamic promises to deliver a unique blend of action, humor, and emotional depth. The reunion is not just a treat for fans but a celebration of two characters who have significantly impacted the superhero landscape.The anticipation surrounding their interaction is immense, with fans eager to see how their contrasting personalities and fighting styles will mesh. The film is expected to be a perfect mix of humor, heart, and high-octane action, with both actors bringing their A-game to the table.Overall, the reunion of Deadpool and Wolverine is shaping up to be a cinematic event that highlights the strengths of both characters and the actors who portray them.

You're joining at a bit of a low point.""","I've been waiting and waiting for a good Marvel movie again after all the garbage released in recent years (except Spider-Man and Guardians Vol. 3). Deadpool & Wolverine is the best Marvel movie since Endgame in my opinion.The story is okay, nothing special, and it doesn't matter that much in this movie because everything else is perfect. It's the cleverly written comedy and the chemistry between Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman that really makes this film shine. So great to see Wolverine again! You also got to see other characters make a cameo/comeback that I was not at all prepared for. It was just great and goosebumped me up! The characters are also exactly as they should be and played perfectly by the actors. The bad guy is good, not the best bad guy, but good and contribute to the movie and comedy of it by making fools of our two leads.The jokes and satire are so hilariously funny in this one as well and they took the humor a step further and didn't hold back.

The first was absolutely brilliant and the second followed, so why in this one I feel such a big miss? Its not that the jokes became less funny or Reynolds is not giving all he's got for the ticket you bought, but something was missing and that includes his relationship with one - Hugh Jackman.I can bluntly say what it is that is sitting in the back of my head. The relationship with marvel and the repeatability of the same concept once again to the level it doesn't cracks me up. I will know that to expect and though the team up promises something extra, you still get the feeling that you've seen it all and there is nothing new to give.It's perfect for the trilogy to extinct itself while joining marvel's ranks. It's the effect they have on all that is good and once was the MCU. You need to study hard to align and to be a fanatic fan not to miss any small detail, cameo or any Easter egg that they are laying on your silly head.Seems that nothing will make Marvell's collapsing process to stop, not even their new Mashiach recruit or him teaming up with the classic version of the Wolverine. Nothing can stop the process and nothing can make this dying universe to rise above its difficulties and mediocre level - not even the golden laying goose of Fox - Deadpool.Hugh Jackman seems like he was forced on the movie, as part of him being a great friend to Reynolds and their YouTube video gags. Jackman is not alone, as several other characters that I won't specify in order not to be hanged due to spoilers' reasons, are also in the movie with a Cameo show and nothing past it.This movie is funny, but not compelling as its predecessors - it had good vibe, jokes and what not, but it continues not to surprise with the breaking of the fourth wall and feels like it won't be remembered a long time after it's done. No specific or coherent plot, what so ever and or any other luring elements except cameos and fun time on Fox's account.The chemistry almost doesn't exist, because of the dynamics and nature of and between the main characters seems to tilt only to the side of Deadpool - feels like wolverine is in his own long cameo performance and waits to get out of his spandex and back to his grave. On the other side - who else can get into this suit and blades other the Jackman?Though it is a lot of fun time and well performed action sequences, it is another good example that no need to dig out corps from their graves if you don't need to. Marvell seems to feel always they have to do those stuff so we're rolling with the flow, but this is most definitely not the best Deadpool show.

10,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9927197/?ref_=tturv_perm_209,LFG!!,"Deadpool & Wolverine is freaking UNREAL! I have never laughed harder in an MCU film before; this was an exhilarating, extremely fun time at the movies! It's the shot in the arm the MCU so desperately needed. Vulgar, violent, scathing, and at times, even touching, this R-rated romp holds nothing back delivering everything its fans want with maximum effort. It even manages to pay respect to the Fox era's legacy while ushering in a new one for Marvel Studios!The hype truly paid off beautifully - I left the theatre with the biggest smile on my face! Did I just see the best film of 2024? Definitely not. With that being said, this might actually be the most entertaining movie I've seen all year! Two things can be true simultaneously: a film can be a great theatrical experience full of cheering, whooping, and excitement and still be structurally and narratively deficient. They're not mutually exclusive, and both perceptions deserve acknowledgment. But honestly, I don't even care about the issues this film has. Yes, it has flaws, it's messy, and it has a meandering plot filled with indulgent cameos and a paper-thin villain. And yet, I loved it. It brought me so much joy, I enjoyed the hell out of it and don't want to stop rewatching it (I've already seen it twice)! So yeah... 5 stars. I had the best time watching this movie.This feels like a comic book come to life for better and worse. It feels damn great to see Hugh Jackman back as Wolverine and his hilarious banter with the pitch-perfect Ryan Reynolds is the heart of what makes this entertaining film work over its convoluted multiverse plot. Reynolds and Jackman truly are a perfect pairing - and getting to see Deadpool and Wolverine on screen together after so many years is just pure magic! Their dynamic onscreen is reminiscent of films like Planes, Trains & Automobiles, Midnight Run, and 48 Hours - I loved this film for not trying to be anything except a buddy road trip movie with a lot of laughs and heart.Those who show up for the dynamic between our heroes will get an insane amount of payoff; numerous moments between Deadpool and Wolverine that will leave you smiling long after the movie ends! Not to mention the insane surprises along the way. I'm actually quite shocked at how much they were able to keep secret. A lot of these moments are way too spoilery to talk about in detail - but I loved the way that the cameos (which are moreso strong yet small supporting roles across the story) all served a strong narrative purpose, contributing to the overall themes of the film as well as serving as a poignant farewell and celebration of the Fox era of films! Truly one of my favourite things about Deadpool & Wolverine is its veneration of the Fox universe. I walked in expecting ""Deadpool and friends move to the MCU, screw everything else lol"" but the whole movie is a love letter to a messier but very important time for these kinds of movies, celebrating the value in the fun, weird, uneven films, and occasionally flawed films and rejected ideas that paved the way before and outside of the MCU. Most importantly, this film respects what has come before and doesn't just disregard it.What else did I love? The action is bloody, brutal and so much fun, the opening credits might be my favourite in the entire MCU, it has sky-high energy and is constantly hilarious with some awesome meta-humour that pokes fun at the MCU, Disney, Kevin Feige, filmmaking, as well as the film industry, all complemented by a plethora of epic needle drops, camera work, and some top-notch editing. I thought Shawn Levy did a fantastic job in the director's chair and handled the tone beautifully, crafting and weaving together such memorable comedic moments, fun action scenes, and a true sense of emotional insight and focus on the characters. This movie has a surprising amount of heart and a strong emotional core - balancing the humour and emotion so well.Does this reinvent the wheel? No. Did it need to? Absolutely not. What it does is reinvigorate the franchise and inject the glorious madness of Deadpool in the best (and most self-aware) way. It is entirely aware of the type of insane story that it is telling, and that is occasionally messy, yet there are still plenty of heartfelt moments with Jackman especially. It has its fair share of narrative flaws, but it delivered everything I needed and left me energized once it ended. Deadpool & Wolverine really is a blast like no other! It delivers a phenomenal theatrical experience - it's so much fun to see with an audience! I laughed so hard I almost cried and can't wait to see this again right away! To me, it's perfect, no notes. It gets better and better each time I see it - I adore this movie and just have so much fun with it!

But luckily I was wrong, this has been one of the best movies I've seen this year. This summer is such a win for superhero content. We got the new season of The Boys, we got Deadpool & Wolverine, and we are getting the last season of Umbrella Academy! This movie was a love letter to Fox's many movies about X-men and other superheros I don't want to spoil. The fighting scenes were so good they had a great coreography, they were bloody violent and gory I forgot this was Marvel! I could have gone with less Marvel Jesus jokes because they repeated them so many times and they were not funny but oh well. I also disliked the amount of sex jokes, way too many, someone needs to go to horny jail. This was yet another multiverse marvel movie that introduced new multiverse rules never before established. I was sad to see some actors missing that had previously been in Deadpool and Deadpool 2, would have been nice to see them. Oh and the whole Wolverine deal was not clear, like I get what happened, but how did it happen? Couldn't they show us, maybe using comics instead of actors so they did not have to pay them if that was the problem? Oh well, I got a poster for going so I'm not complaining, and I also bought 2 little Deadpool figurine.

5,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9921450/?ref_=tturv_perm_213,A sequel that focuses on fan service rather than sharper and more clever humor,"Marvel's highly anticipated ""Deadpool and Wolverine"" is finally here, and as we all know, it comes at a bit of a crossroads for the MCU (and the genre as a whole.) While I've never loved the superhero genre overall, there's plenty of films in the genre that I've been entertained by, and certainly some good characters that make up at least some of the comic-book blockbusters that audiences love. That said, I will admit that I have been largely disillusioned by the genre as a whole after ""Endgame"" and when things started to progress towards focusing solely on multiverse and cameo-related stuff rather than trying to tell any semblance of a compelling or character-driven story. I enjoyed the first two Deadpool films (and saw them both in theaters when they came out) for the most part, and thought their irreverent, fourth-wall-breaking humor felt relatively fresh at the time by poking fun at superhero movie tropes in fresh ways--so, rest assured, I went in hoping to like this. While there are still some funny moments, the film overall feels very tedious and has everything that I don't really like about this genre and franchise in its current state (as in, focusing on multiverse and cameo-related hijinks with no real stakes/consequential plot/character development.) So for me, this was regrettably a big downgrade from the first two Deadpool films, both of which I would rate a 7 or 7.5/10.The film mostly takes place after ""Deadpool 2,"" and the basic underpinnings of the (very thin) plot is that Deadpool is captured by the Time Variance Authority, and has to save his own ""timeline"" from deteriorating, which, of course, necessitates working with Wolverine. Even though I wasn't a huge fan of the film, I will most certainly admit that chemistry between Reynolds and Jackman can be quite fun--charming even too--in certain scenes. While many of the jokes don't work, there are at least a few that do. But unfortunately, the film falls victim to the same flaws of many of these other recent Marvel films in that there is not much of a plot, or anything remotely resembling compelling dramatic stakes. Given the ""multiverse"" nature of the story (and the fact that both of its main characters have regenerative healing powers,) nothing seems at risk or able to effectively generate dramatic tension. Instead, the film revels in fan-service, which of course is not expected. Some people will very much enjoy that, but for those of us who don't have everything memorized about the 2000s X-Men movies, your mileage may vary. The film's action is for the most part bland and forgettable in terms of how it's shot (and often repetitive in terms of how it's depicted and executed,) which may partially be because its director, Shawn Levy, doesn't have much of a track record directing action films.While I didn't like this film as much as the previous two Deadpool movies, I recognize that many viewers will enjoy this film for the exact same reasons (over-reliance on cameos, fan service, multiverse stuff) that I wasn't as keen on it. And guess what: that's completely fine. Film is subjective. I realize that legions of comic book fans will love their experience seeing this film in theaters, and it's good that they will enjoy it. I also realize that Marvel--and possibly much of the entire superhero genre as a whole--is increasingly not to my taste, or at least much less so than many of these films were 5 or 10 years ago. That's okay too. My score, in objective terms, is only a 5/10, and I wouldn't recommend it to people who aren't big Marvel fans, but I think anyone reading this review can determine whether they would want to see this film or not--if they haven't made that decision already.",Helpful,•,12,16,bastille-852-731547,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur48308095/?ref_=tturv_usr_213_t,25-Jul-24,

The newest Installment is exactly the same, but funner in more ways then one. The cinema was great especially for a midnight screening, plenty of laughs in the Cinema. So it's time to review, the ultimate, the Marvel Jesus, oh wait no it's just ""Deadpool + Wolverine"".Very fun start, it felt cinematic and had Brisc pacing and at break neck pace, quite literally. The first action sequence for that reason is very well done, it had plenty of laughs. The ""206 Bones"" in the body and then they made a joke about ""Gossip Girl being 207"" that was a creative joke and quite a clever one too. Deadpool is probably at his best, he's more brutal which is a good and bad thing, and he's also more funnier. And Ryan Reynolds puts in an outstanding performance. Very heart-felt and touching at times, but most importantly entertaining and funny.Wolverine was a great character to bring back, lots of fan service moments, and they worked well because it showed his emotional side and why he had given up everything, and Not only that but it was a top-notch Performance by Hugh Jackman. Possibly the stand Out, but both Ryan and Hugh Put in an excellent performance. I thought there chemistry did lack at times, but overall they were fun together, and I felt it was the right move from Marvel to pare these two up as they do have some great moments together and between them.Cassandra Nova was the Villain, we got some cameos from Marvel characters, Blade being the biggest serprise out of them all, I won't say any more on that because I don't want to spoil it too much. Cassandra was very powerful and could brake anything quite easily, she like goes into your soul and it shares some good and bad moments in your life, particularly moving when she did it to Logan.The chemistry was perfect between Hugh and Ryan, But I did feel as though his character was too jokey at times, and also the film was fairly gory, and too gory. Aside from that this film was very enjoyable and Entertaining. I'd certainly give it a re-Watch. And I like the team-work between Deadpool and Logan, they both worked together which was interesting to see. So the big question is...,Would I recommend this Film?,Yes absolutely, I think it balances humour, Entertainment, clever witty dialogue with some fun scenes very very well.

The storyline is extremely sarcastic and is a satirical parody of the multiverse, which was parodied by Marvel managers with their bureaucratic myopia.The film also features multiple cameos and cameo appearances by other characters from the Marvel universe, many of whom have long been forgotten or pushed into the background. I was pleased with the appearance of ""Blade"", and yes, I don't see anyone except Wesley Snipes in this role!These ""returns"" delight and make you smile at the paradoxes of the multiverse, which is why the antihero calls himself a ""Paradox"".Constant intersections of time lines and ridicule of the complexity of the plot can confuse new viewers, but for devoted fans it will become a kind of intellectual game and an occasion for revisions and discussions, although I would not take the movie seriously at all, because the film has only one purpose - to entertain, and it succeeds, but not for me, well, that's my ""different worldview""However, despite all its advantages and success with a large audience, the film cannot hide from the shadow of its own success. He plays on nostalgia and the cult status of his characters, but his deep dependence on recognizable cliches and fanservice opens the door to possible criticism, but this pop icon is absolutely not afraid: the film laughs at itself in every scene.Ultimately, ""Deadpool and Wolverine"" stay true to themselves, creating a fun and vibrant cinematic experience. This is a film for viewers who can laugh at their favorite characters, not forgetting that behind every comical moment there is a loving and appreciative audience. And although I perceive this picture with irony, like the characters Deadpool and Wolverine themselves, but I admit that such a decrease in the degree of seriousness only enhances its uniqueness.

I can't imagine the amount of effort to put together a coherent script that contains a hot stew of satirical comedy, The-Boys-level violence, fourth-wall superimposing, and out-of-everywhere cameos and to convince Disney to fund it. Despite playing under Marvel's worldview of TVA and multiverse, Deadpool & Wolverine actually tells a simple story of two losers saving the world and redeeming one another --- a could-not-get-any-simpler formula but made with such respect and compassion of the lore which we have not seen from Marvel productions in a long time. It is a rewarding experience to all the fans who accompanied the cinematic superhero history thus far, whether the universe under Fox, Marvel, or more. However, this movie is extremely fan-based, as well as many other superhero films that are successful in part because they allude to prior works, which is concerning because the story itself is often placed secondary. Anyhow, this film deserves to be enjoyed in a crowded theater or with a bunch of friends --- just like the old Marvel.",Helpful,•,1,2,dorMancyx,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur125833174/?ref_=tturv_usr_227_t,8-Aug-24,

All I wanted","If you have made it so far past the premiere without getting spoiled, congratulations! I wouldn't have minded waiting for VOD, but spoilers just keep popping up on social media, articles and reels without looking for them. It isn't that the plot is being spoiled, but rather the main appeal of the movie. Going to see the third instalment of the Deadpool franchise, you probably know already what you're in for. Crude humor, violence, jokes and cameos. Said cameos would have entertained me more, would I have not known that they were coming.The Deadpool movies cannot in my opinion work in a vacuum. Just watching these 3 movies without awareness about the stuff they are referencing is almost pointless. To get the most out of the third one, you should be at least aware of comic book movies since the late 90s (not gonna name them though).Me being a 90s kid, watching comic book movies as they came out, I feel like I was the target audience, and all the gags, fan service and cameos really made me laugh. I rate the Deadpool movies all pretty much the same, this isn't any better or worse than the first two. You know the drill, you'll get what you came for.As a Wolverine movie, it is surely better than Origins (most things are) but not even approaching Logan (few movies do). What I'd change or improve on the movie, is that the story is a bit underdeveloped. Particularly the backstory why Logan is so morose is only told, not shown. But I guess I'd require further cameos that would bloat the budget...On a Sidenote: Dafne Keen has matured nicely and Emma Corrin has a voice like honey. Does she do audiobooks?

7,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9934837/?ref_=tturv_perm_230,Mostly Worth The Hype,"Deadpool and Wolverine is the long-awaited third Deadpool movie, and the dream crossover many fans have been waiting for. This has been the most hyped-up superhero film in quite some time, as superhero fatigue has settled in with the past few years. Does the film live to the hype. Fir the most part yes. If you're just looking to see Deadpool and Wolverine team up and wreak havoc together you won't be disappointed.I'm a casual Deadpool fan myself. I liked the character, but I do think he's overrated. Though, I am a major fan of Wolverine, and have always loved Hugh Jackman in the role. I personally thought the first Deadpool movie was okay but wasn't a big fan of the second. And the X-Men films are all over the map in terms of quality. Also, I've lost much of my investment in the MCU, and superhero movies in general, these past few years. So, I wasn't hugely excited for this film.Objectively, I'd say it's on the same tier as the first Deadpool movie for me. However, I enjoyed this film more, mainly for the inclusion of Wolverine. Deadpool and Wolverine have great chemistry together, and their banter is what makes the film. When the movie focuses on either of them individually, the film is just okay, but together they're a lot of fun.Seeing Hugh Jackman final dawn the comic accurate Wolverine costume was admittedly awesome. Seeing Jackman finally put on the iconic mask made me almost lose it in the theater. There are also some cameos and appearances by certain characters that I did not expect to see and each brought a smile to my face. I'm glad I only saw the teaser, and none of the trailers, going into this. For many these fanservice scenes might seem gimmicky. However, for someone who grew up watching superhero movies in the 2000s, before the MCU, this film (and No Way Home) felt like a love letter to me as a longtime fan.The film looks great, and the music is amazing. The soundtrack of this film easily rivals any of the Guardians of the Galaxy movies. Going in I was afraid, since Fox is now under Disney, that the violence and profanity would be significantly toned down. Thankfully, you don't have to worry about that. This is definitely a hard R, much like the previous Deadpool movies. The action is on-point. There are three action set pieces that I found just awesome to watch.I didn't love this movie though. For the same reasons I haven't loved any of the Deadpool flicks. The jokes can be hit or miss, especially when it comes to the meta humor. This is my personal preference, but I'm not the biggest fan of meta humor. A bit sprinkled in is fine, but too much can easily destroy immersion for me. The other Deadpool movies walked a fine line with that. This, like Deadpool 2, took it a bit too far. The entire plot of this movie revolves around a meta joke, kinda. As a result, I wasn't really invested in the story or what was at stake. Again, what saves this movie is the interaction between Reynolds and Jackman. The plot is the weakest aspect of it.The film does feel too long as well. After the opening scene the film does drag its feet a bit in the beginning. Also, the third act goes on for too long.",Helpful,•,2,1,mitchell5954,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur42936359/?ref_=tturv_usr_230_t,3-Aug-24,

And let me tell you, it delivered in many ways! From the jaw-dropping opening scene to the top-tier cinematic entrance shots, the slow-motion camera work, and the hilarious bickering between Deadpool and Wolverine - it was pure gold. The fire-lit backgrounds, the suits, and the epic action scenes had me audibly reacting in the theater. Deadpool's slicing, shooting, and fighting were like something straight out of a video game. Fun, funny, and full of thrills - Deadpool nailed it on all three fronts.And the cameos! Oh, the cameos! There were plenty, and each one had a twist that left me grinning. Each character truly embodied their roles, and it was awesome to see Deadpool, Wolverine, and various Sony characters making their way into the MCU. Sure, it's not quite on par with the Spider-Man movie (insert Spider-Man pointing meme here), but it's close.Now, brace yourselves for my critique. Despite hitting many of the right notes, Deadpool 3 felt like it was missing a true purpose, a real threat, and a compelling villain. It seemed like Deadpool was being set up as the MCU's savior, with heavy influences from Dune and Mad Max. This lack of a solid antagonist left much to be desired - so much so that I canceled my second viewing. That's a big deal for me, considering I saw the first and second installments of Deadpool multiple times in theaters.In the end, I'm giving Deadpool and Wolverine a solid 7.5 out of 10 - or about an 4 out of 5 stars.

To some, this may scream fanservice, but let's face it: in this franchise, that's the name of the game. The jokes are rapid fire and virtually non-stop, poking fun at everything from the state of Disney and Marvel to how much we've been waiting for this crossover to the tropes of big budget films like this, along with the requisite load of fourth wall breaks, a personal favorite type of humor. Suffice it to say, all this leads to a ton of laughs. But, the film surprisingly also has a decent story. There are actual stakes that affect people other than our heroes, and some shockingly decent emotional moments. And, the pacing is perfect, fast when it needs and slow when it needs.The return of Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman to their most famous roles is more than welcome. They prove they still have it and have all the chemistry. You can just tell they had a ton of fun with this film and the chance to finally work together on a superhero film that isn't garbage. Just as thankfully, after the previous two films didn't even give us one good villain, this one gives us two in Matthew McFayden and Emma Corrin. And, the cameos are pervasive and everywhere. I won't say who appears to avoid spoilers, but they are all fantastic and even get some laughs, like when an actor appears who we think is one character but turns out to be someone else.The action scenes are the best in the series, fast paced, brutal, and giving us some huge laughs. The best are, in my opinion, the fight during the opening credits (my disappointment over how they aren't nonsensical credits like the first two was undone by the clever editing and just how awesome the action is) and the fight between the two leads in the car. The sets are stellar, including the returning TVA headquarters and the amusing lair of Corrin's character. And the soundtrack is fantastic, including some hilarious song choices during the two aforementioned action scenes.Overall, Deadpool and Wolverine may very well be the best of the Deadpool films.

I'd say a big reason for this is that there felt like there were even fewer real stakes for the superhero characters than normal. Both could regenerate. And everything else was so hammed up as part of comedy, that there didn't seem to be a lot of care for me in any of the character. Not only did they not seem to be real or in serious danger, but they didn't seem to analogous to something or someone that mattered to me either.The easter eggs were relentless in a bad way. They did the multiverse thing again. And it really seems to make it so anyone who dies feels like they were just a video game character losing one life rather than losing the entire game. The only one that I thought did the multiverse idea particularly well was Sony with the Spider-man and the Everything Everywhere all at once movie. I think this is because the stories were a bit more ambitious, original and cartoonish in style, and they made each interaction of each universe unique enough to each matter to the viewer and feel indispensable from one universe to another.This movie will not age like fine wine even if you enjoy it now. You probably won't enjoy it much in 10+ years. The 4th wall breaks are part of the style and identity of Deadpool. But perhaps they should have been relegated to one movie or at least had a few more of Deadpool's established original friends be part of his journey in this movie. That way there could be some more stakes for them rather than for others.",Helpful,•,3,11,brianjohnson-20043,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur84655994/?ref_=tturv_usr_250_t,2-Aug-24,

But this third one is nothing more than another wet dream of Reynolds, and not one of the properly conceived ones.It doesn't surprise me that there were so many writers involved, as the quantity only served to dilute the quality.Obviously, as a writer, I'm mainly referring to the story's plot structure, character development, their depth, and everything that makes a good story enjoyable and memorable. Yet, all of that was lost in a sea of cameos devoid of emotional depth for the main story, and even a nonsensical barrage of verbiage from all the characters, each with less comedic weight than the last, until it became tiresome.In other words, they relied on nostalgia as the primary driver of this movie and even tried to ride the coattails of Logan's success to exploit it; however, the lack of connection and emotion caused them to desecrate one of the best movies, and one of the best endings, in this category, all to satisfy the spontaneous ideas of a character who should take some time to think things through better.It's not that I have a problem with bringing Wolverine back, but not like this. Much less under the stupid premise that Vanessa and Wade broke up due to Deadpool's frustration over not being able to do something meaningful with his life, even though there wasn't the slightest hint of those thoughts in the previous movie. In fact, it doesn't even fit with Deadpool's ideology.Honestly, I couldn't believe that after all that odyssey, their relationship would break so easily, and even less so, that it would be mended just as easily-and without the slightest involvement of all those -supposed- friends of Deadpool.Moreover, I'm not even going to get started on the dramatic holes in the timelines, let alone the cliché appearance of a villain pulled from nowhere, the unification of worlds that don't even make sense together, or the barrage of theatrical scenes that completely disrupt the story's flow.It's clear that the writers were aware of the lack of narrative depth involved in bringing up the multiverse and time travel (themes that played a detrimental role in the MCU) as a method to revive characters and continue profiting off them. However, they didn't care and did it anyway.In any case, it's just my opinion, and as far as I'm concerned, I'm going to watch Logan once more to get rid of such a frustrating narrative structure, and then wait until Ryan Reynolds invents another character to make fun of this terrible event. But if the fans continue to prioritize nostalgia so much, then I suppose this will be our cinematic future, just like what happened with Star Wars.That said, I greatly enjoyed the choreography between Wolverine and Deadpool, the nostalgic appearance of some characters (even though they made no sense), and even seeing some actors I hadn't seen in a long time. In that sense, it felt like this movie was more of a personal project by the fans to pay tribute to those heroes, and therefore, a nice reminder of those times, which would explain the additional scenes at the end of the movie, and even the music from my childhood. However, as a writer, it was inevitable for me to hate the premise, the plot, and the overall character development, since the new ends up desecrating the old, just as Deadpool exemplified with Wolverine's lifeless body; which seems to be Disney's new strategy with all the remakes they have cooking.""We were so preoccupied with whether we could, that we didn't stop to think if we should.""In the end, when we understand that in the digital world our voices can last for centuries, it forces us to realize that we must refine the footprints we will leave behind.

Beyond the fact that one can talk about fandom, the interesting thing that Marvel's new project proposes is to honor its past and look together to the future with a duo that breaks it on screen with charisma, blood and emotions.No one can argue with Reynolds' charisma, but it's good to know that Jackman is joining us to give us the tone necessary for an on-screen adventure full of gags, incredible sequences and the adult quality that we all wanted and that we now also know we needed.This is where the intelligence of a director like Levy comes in, who knows how to handle humor, action and blood and sets out to give us all those Marvel-style madness in a correct, precise and fearless way. So much politically incorrect humor, references, jokes and transgressive moments that are squared even over its two predecessors. Decisions that serve to make a correct mix between laughing at the entire world of superheroes, but also giving it the moment to vindicate its own story.So we can ask ourselves, was it worth the risk? Of course, it was worth the risk. It's pure entertainment that leaves no one out of the party, it's a gigantic event that Marvel wins with, not by providing the best MCU movie, but by giving us the movie that we all needed right now, which is to believe again that everything can be possible at Marvel.To think that this is a movie that only uses fandom resources to sustain itself is really wrong. It is a well-made movie that has absolute intelligence embedded in knowing how to handle emotions in equal parts and in respecting itself as a movie that has people behind it who know about cinema and entertainment.It is a well-directed, well-acted film, with a brutal soundtrack, with well-executed sequences and with a villain who is very well occupied, it is not a simple event film to satisfy needs, it is a film that fulfills its role as being in good hands that make it noticeable and without reproaches.For me, it is a result that does not disappoint, it remains firm with the initial proposal of the saga, and knows how to take advantage of certain decisions that Marvel planned lately and that end up being the perfect addition to become one of the most fun and functional crossovers of superhero franchises.A film to watch and enjoy and leave the theater satisfied, simply because Marvel was what it needed to give us, and we were totally grateful to receive it.",Helpful,•,1,3,saolivaresm,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur132357199/?ref_=tturv_usr_253_t,3-Sep-24,

This film leans into its absurdity with the kind of sharp wit and humor that only Deadpool can deliver, making it a refreshing take on a trope that many believe has run its course.From the start, Deadpool and Wolverine takes its time building momentum. The pacing may feel slow at first, but trust me, it's worth the wait. The jokes come fast and furious, with almost every gag hitting the mark. Some jokes are more memorable than others, but the overall comedic tone is consistent throughout. The film's fourth-wall breaks are the best we've seen in the trilogy, with Deadpool gleefully mocking both the multiverse and its tired conventions.There is a bit of a pacing hiccup in the middle of the film, as the exposition drags on a little longer than it should. However, this lull is more than compensated for by the film's unapologetic fan service. The movie knows what its audience wants and delivers in spades, offering a buffet of references, cameos, and nods to both the comics and previous films.While Deadpool and Wolverine steal the spotlight, I wish the side characters had more depth and chemistry with one another. There are moments where the supporting cast feels like mere props, lacking the dynamic interaction that could have elevated the narrative. This isn't a dealbreaker, but it leaves you wanting more from the talented ensemble that supports our two leads.The ending is nothing short of unforgettable. The entire climax is a spectacle of chaos and hilarity, and the choice of song and its mixing is executed to perfection. It's a fitting conclusion to a film that revels in its absurdity and self-awareness, cementing its status as a parody of a dying genre.Deadpool and Wolverine is a stellar superhero comedy, expertly satirizing the overdone multiverse concept while delivering a fun, engaging, and laugh-out-loud experience. It's a must-see for fans of the franchise and anyone who appreciates a good laugh at the expense of superhero tropes.",Helpful,•,2,2,RebelPanda,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur58930232/?ref_=tturv_usr_255_t,6-Aug-24,
8,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9923328/?ref_=tturv_perm_256,"Fun, thrilling but not without issues","Bottom of the line is deadpool and wolverine is extremely funny, entertaining with phenomal action and some great fan service and that's all I needed from this movie. The performances from renyolds and jackman were phenomal and Emma Corrin made a really striking impression as the villain. Tha action throughout the movie is amazing with some great set pieces and music intertwined leading to a final thirty minutes packed with joy, fun jokes and some really powerful emotional moments. Casandra nova makes for a thrilling villain who's just as evil as she is crazy and she makes for a real threat Emma Corrin takes this and fully runs with it. The movie never goes full multiverse crazy and pokes fun at other films that have done before it and it works to its strengths whilst there is a lot of fan service none of it feels unearned (and believe me there is a lot) that being said it does feel like at points the movie uses it as a crutch. The films pacing is great moving at a break neck pace from start to finish leading to no moments of Boredom it felt like a theme park experience more than a movie so take that as you will. The writing at points is very clever the jokes rarely fell flat and the way it utilized it's characters was really good. I really had so much fun with this movie and I was grinning ear to ear at several points and my whole screening was laughing at the jokes.I do however have a few gripes, having a character that can break the third wall is really fun and the writers often use it to poke fun at lazy writing throughout the movie but that doesn't negate the fact it's lazy writing. The film relies heavily on easy short cuts and heavy exposition to carry the thin plot. Yes by all means poke fun at exposition dumps but if you have the smarts to joke about it maybe avoid doing it yourself for example make it seem like a characters gonna go on an exposition dump make a joke about it then not carry through. Exposition is natural for movies and is extremelyuseful and effective when used right and at points here it's used amazingly but most of
The time it feels lazy. In addition to this the film at points feels a little half baked I feel like they rushed this film because they needed something to save the mcu and whilst it leads to some of the most fun I've had in the cinema for a long time I still feel there is a lot of missing potential the plot is very thin it's very reliant on convenient events happen to progress the story. For example During the movie the characters need a form of transport to get to a location and they straight away get it , dont make it an issue if you can't resolve it properly. The cameos whilst really cool do feel extremely fan servicey when they are first introduced there are four ""cameos"" here that are fully blown support roles and their introduction literally has pauses in dialogue so the audience can supposedly cheer? I feel like that scene in particularly is gonna hold up awfully. Levy is a very strong director and we know this from his work on stranger things but that doesn't fully translate here yeah there as some fantastic shots and cool camera movements but it feels very generic for the majority of the movie. The cgi is great at points but lacklustre at others and some of the shot genuinely look really cheap for what is a very expensive movie.In conclusion, deadpool and wolverine is fun, enjoyable and extremely funny with phenomenal action, score, cgi, performances and at points some very clever writing with a slick run time of two hours it's just enough to overcome some major issues that previous mcu movies before it also suffered from. Whilst it's a step in the right direction marvel need to take more care of their projects in pre production rather than seeing what they can salvage in the editing room.",Helpful,•,3,1,harry-34518,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur104275634/?ref_=tturv_usr_256_t,27-Jul-24,

9,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9920750/?ref_=tturv_perm_259,"A fun ""greatest hits"" Fox Marvel film within the MCU that is relentless.","Wow, where to start. For this review I will not spoil because the cameos/characters were super well kept even from a fan like me who seeks out rumors and scoops. Compared to ENDGAME, SPIDER-MAN: NO WAY HOME and others, speculation and rumors were a bit more obvious. For the most part Marvel Studios did a very good job hiding a good chunk.Let me start off by saying, most of us don't count the X-MEN ORIGNS: WOLVERINE film, and because of that I always kinda had a feeling that one day Ryan would convince Hugh, and that Hugh would eventually have a change of heart and return for this, because a proper Deadpool & Wolverine film without these two would have been an absolute missed opportunity. On a side note, it's precisely the reason I never bought a Hot Toy of Deadpool and Wolverine on the chance that this would happen. If you know what Hot Toys 1/6 scale figures are, kudos to you.So here we are and I can tell you right now that it's the movie that many thought DOCTOR STRANGE IN THE MULTIVERSE OF MADNESS was expected to be. Some cameos that weren't revealed in the marketing, but were speculated was kind of obvious due to Ryan being particularly close with some of his actor friends, but there are cameos and characters that have actual meaningful roles. You would never have guessed that these particular characters Deadpool and Wolverine interact with would be in a movie like this and be played by that said actor. If you're a giant comic-book/super hero genre fan, you will be surprised.DEADPOOL & WOLVERINE is equally the story of two characters, and also a story of two movies. One of which that celebrates the best of Fox's Marvel and uses the Fox Legacy characters extremely well, in a way that goes beyond empty cameos. The other is a mundane story that at times struggles to bring it all together, but good enough to get by the film as it is carried by the performances from Ryan and Hugh.At this point Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman can do this in their sleep. Born to play these roles and eventually they will one day hang it up for good (second retirement for Hugh as he's pulling an MJ), so we just need to appreciate what we have now. We're also now at an age where the talented visual development artists and costume designers can embrace the colorful and out there nature of superhero suits, so to finally see Hugh in the yellow and blue just hits the feels.Emma Corrin plays the film's antagonist Cassandra Nova and they are very good. They chew up the scenery, but like traditional MCU fashion it is a villain that is underdeveloped. Not the worst like many others, but they got the short end of the stick. Matthew Macfadyen plays Mr. Paradox, a TVA agent that has ambitions of his own. I haven't watched SUCCESSION, but I'm told it's similar to his character in the show. Leslie Uggams and Rob Delany also get a shoutout as Blind Al and Peter.As one should expect, tons of profanity and action that are all great fun and super violent. Deadpool has a lot of fun at the expense of the current state with the MCU. With the exception of SPIDER-MAN: NO WAY HOME, the MCU has been bloated and unfocused post ENDGAME and Deadpool's fourth wall breaking holds nothing back about it, some Kevin Feige and meta jokes hit too. If you ever read my reviews I feel there is a time and place for humor, and certainly for a character like Deadpool a lot of the comedy works.Director Shawn Levy deserves some praise for this juggling act, as do the writers Rhett Reese, Paul Wernick, and Zeb Wells. Also kudos to something you won't see on screen, but I felt that the film has that balance between being accessible to the general movie going audience, while also satisfying the well versed die-hard fans of the source material and films.DEADPOOL & WOLVERINE is an extremely fun ride. I think it's easily the best of the three DEADPOOL films. That doesn't mean that the MCU is entirely cured from its current state, but this definitely puts it back slightly on track. Despite some of the same problems most of the MCU movies face, the backbone of the this film is carried through Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman, and how the film uses the other characters in meaningful fashion. I'll be curious to see how it will be received down the line when the novelty wears off, but for now it did duplicate the level of hype and feelings similar of SPIDER-MAN: NO WAY HOME and I would place this in the higher tier of the bunch within the MCU and Fox.9/10.",Helpful,•,13,11,drawlife,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur14294603/?ref_=tturv_usr_259_t,25-Jul-24,

The exploration of themes such as redemption, friendship, and the cost of immortality adds layers to the narrative, making it more than just a typical superhero movie.

Wolverine fits seamlessly into the dynamic, with his gruff charm balancing Deadpool's relentless humor. However, by the time the film reaches the second and third acts, the excessive swearing starts to wear thin. While the humor remains strong, some jokes land better than others, leading to a few hit-or-miss moments.The cinematography is excellent, with stunning color grading and a mix of close-ups and medium shots that are visually appealing. The editing also deserves praise, as it effectively enhances the humor and overall flow of the film. The costume and production design are both top-notch. The locations are beautifully chosen.The VFX, while colorful and eye-pleasing, often felt artificial, which detracted from the overall experience. The abundance of pop culture references, while entertaining, sometimes pulls focus away from the main story, making the film feel overstuffed and slightly chaotic.The plot that jumps around too much, making it difficult to stay fully engaged. Moreover, the story feels overstretched, especially in the second and third acts, where the narrative starts to lose its way. The villains, unfortunately, don't add much to the film - they're cartoonish and lack depth, which undermines the stakes of the story.Overall, it's the kind of film that's so bad it's good, offering ""dumb fun"" that keeps you laughing, even if you're not sure why.

7,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9932250/?ref_=tturv_perm_270,This is a hard one to review due to its complex nature.,"So in many way I think this may be the best Deadpool movie. However it has some issues that end up hurting it.Let's start out with the good.Having Wolverine is just very fans dream. The interaction between DP and Wolverine are perfect and what you would expect. Especially when they fight as no one ever really wins since they are more or less unable to die. The amount of cameos is mind blowing and had us nerds gleefully shouting. As did many of the very meta jokes! And of course having the TVA was just perfect given DPs multiverse, 4th wall breaking nature.The bad? All of the above sort of.Let's be clear, unless you seen the old X-Men/hero movies before the MCU and unless you read alot of comics. MUCH of the comics and cameos just aren't going to do anything for you. This also means so many jokes are going to go over people's heads. And this is an issue because if your movie depends on all this knowledge, cameos...etc, then you may have to consider how good the movie really is. Fan service is great, but it doesn't always mean a movie is going to be great.Storywise it's actually kind of weak. The villain(s) were ok, admittedly ""she"" was terrifying, but also felt like she wasn't in the movie much. And the other villain, he was kinda funny but again, not really scary per say. And overall their stories weren't exactly deep. And in many ways the story became kind of confusing. How did certain people get in the movie? Which earth where they from? When did they become part of the Marvel movies? Even Deadpools timeline earth is sort of confusing. Granted I've always said with a multiverse, if your not careful, it can makes thing more complicated then they need to be and create issues.One good example is the DP movies we see an older X-men and then in another movie was see the younger (First Class) X-Men. How can this be given the DP movies take place after each other and the timeline for the younger/older X-Men is a period of decades. Granted some of it is inside jokes, but it can be confusing if you think about it.And this movie REALLY upped everything. Including the one liners. And while many were hilarious, it often felt endless and almost overly forced to push a joke every 5 seconds. It's DPs nature, but it also almost goes so much that its exhausting.So in the end if you KNOW the past of the Marvel/Fox movies and some comic stuff, you will love this movie and get most of the jokes. If not, you may find alot of the ""amazing"" or ""funny"" moments lacking.",Helpful,•,0,1,rchosen-193-5535,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur57306456/?ref_=tturv_usr_270_t,1-Aug-24,

Watching Deadpool and Wolverine for the first time today, I was surprised by how much of the plot they ended up showing us in those trailers. It didn't necessarily make me enjoy the film any less, I was just surprised and would have liked to have been a little less knowledgeable about what was to come. I will echo a few other reviews that I've read by saying this is the least of the three Deadpool films. It is still terrific, it just doesn't have the same heart as the others. I'm not really sure they were even interested in making it a Deadpool film to be honest. It was more an opportunity for Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman to make a fun movie together, and the audience is treated to going along for the ride. I enjoyed the film immensely, there was just something about it that felt more forced this time. That didn't matter in the end as I still had a blast and will likely go to see it again at least one more time. Like the majority of the recent ""Multiverse"" films, there are plenty of outstanding cameos in the movie and one double fake that was genius. That being said, the fact that the entertainment industry is to the point where they are mocking those storylines, makes me think that the concept is on its way out. Overall, I had a great time with this, and it was worth watching Reynolds' passion project, even if it wasn't the best Deadpool movie ever.",Helpful,•,4,2,sherwoodbandit-1977,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur109185643/?ref_=tturv_usr_271_t,27-Jul-24,
7,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9930693/?ref_=tturv_perm_272,A solid (mostly) entertaining movie.,"The plot boffins at Marvel (Disney) earn their keep by crowbarring a smorgasbord of whimsical exposition into a somehow acceptable premise. The TVA (time-bureaucrats) have survived Loki and are the plot McGuffin that allows Logan to be resurrected and to be now forced into the MCU. Honestly, it's not that important, let's just appreciate the witty script and the non-stop childish humor in this movie.Ryan Reynolds shines again as Deadpool, but Hugh Jackman seems a little lacklustre at times - but the script honestly favours Reynolds, and Wolverine is second-billing as the title suggests, but we don't get the powerful performance we saw in Logan, which was a little disappointing.The film has structural issues, particularly towards the end and some of the fighting montages make you want to just fast-forward a few seconds because the characters are essentially dancing with fake blood and CGI - more ballet than exciting action movie - but there's plenty of clever writing to offset any of the fake-tension that crops up. The dialogue is razor sharp (did i mention the dialogue is great?), and the music hits the spot. The cameos are fun, even if you actually did forget about Electra (who could forget?).All in all, a nice reminder that the MCU still exists, even if its ""phases"" are lying dead and bloodied on the floor. I don't think the franchise can recover from its disastrous past few years, but it was a fun and rare outing to the cinema.

However apart from half a dozen laugh out loud jokes, I found most of the film to be another example of style/CGI over substance. One big fight scene between Deadpool and Wolverine was fine, but then having another one just made it feel like they were fleshing out the movie due to a lack of plot. Throwing in loads of cameos from past Marvel movies was a nice touch but overall I found the movie to be a bit dull and tiresome. Apparently due to it's success at the box office there is pressure for Reynolds to make another Deadpool, but to be honest I hope he doesn't bother.

Ryan Reynolds, Hugh Jackman and Shawn Levy pour out their hearts for this movie to be what is it.It's beyond the MCU timeline, it's beyond even FOX's ""X-Men"" movies. It's about all the kids who grew up with these movies and these characters. The kids, who are now adults (like me), but still love every bit of it.You know it's going to be fun with these two, but man... I laughed so hard, even my stomach was feeling it.

Seems you'll have to make your own guesses on those allusions.But check = see how 'Nice' Pool's demise and also 'hear' Chris Evans' post credits diatribe against the (baddy) woman;remind you of anything similar in real world?As of whom, fab femme baddy (Emma Corin as a Cassandra) surely couldn't be in describing her frightening mind-f .. = fingering rendition ..?

The simple fact is, that it just creates lazy sloppy plot writing. Anything is possible, everything is redoable and no one need ever die. The only things that die are jeopardy and proper story telling.And that's why this has no heart to it, just a mash up of loosely concocted events, timelines, and characters. Held together by two great marvel characters, superbly acted and choregraphed to level 11. There are some points of soul searching and contemplation, after all, these are probably the two most tragic of all the marvel characters.

But Deadpool refuses and tries to find a replacement ""anchor being"" (Wolverine) to save his world. This movie covers the redemption of both Deadpool from his midlife crisis and Wolverine from his regret of letting down his fellow mutants, the void, their variants, threats and conflicts they face, cameos, etc.I was excited about this movie from its announcements, trailers, promo, and every news I heard. I have been a fan of both Deadpool and Wolverine from the movie franchise. Unfortunately, I couldn't watch it in theatres and regretted it. Even after all the spoilers on the internet, I determined that I should watch this film and I watched it now. What to say? I am deeply disappointed with this film. The storyline was promising and intriguing, with my favourite characters, Deadpool and Wolverine, joining hands; even the response from its release all hyped me up. But didn't deliver up to my expectations.I couldn't connect with either Deadpool's midlife crisis or Wolverine's pain like it didn't work well for me emotionally. I enjoyed every punchline of Deadpool from previous movies but in this one, It felt flat. The very first time I was annoyed, was whenever Deadpool opened his mouth in this one. I understand it's different Wolverine, but I couldn't see the swag or the charms he had in the X-Men Franchise. He feels alien to me, and He is my first and favourite superhero I admired from the superhero genre.All the cameos felt flat as they appeared except one or two. The villains, either Paradox or Cassandra Nova were not well written. Paradox was not intimidating or felt like a threat as Cassandra, but Cassandra was weak in the character arc and only needed to set a climax high point. The action sequences and the songs were admirable at certain points, but it didn't matter when they failed to create excitement or to root for them to see them fight themselves or the enemies.The problem is that they tried to fit as many characters as possible and write a story around it instead of trying to give a good, entertaining multiverse movie with good twists and turns and certain high points. I was watching and waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting..., with a thought that it would get better by the next scene, but all I got was a disappointment from start to end.What I will say about acting when I am disappointed with the whole story, characters, and arcs. The cinematography and composition were decent, but it was a brighter tone than the two Deadpool movies and the X-Men Franchise. The VFX was good as usual. The music and songs were good, but some scenes would have been better with music and required sound designs rather than a silent background. One of my favourite things in the previous Deadpool movies is the intro credits filled with satirical descriptions of the movie's crew, and it was not in this movie; that's a reason why I was disappointed at the start.In conclusion, again I am heavily disappointed by this movie. I disagree with Deadpool as he claimed himself to be the Marvel Jesus. You are just an annoying prick to me after watching this movie.

Liked the NSYNC choreo. Loved the scene with Deadpool and Logan in the car. Some of the fight scenes were cool. I liked the Mad Max replica universe. Kinda.I understood most of the references, I can't say I was terribly amused. Deadpool gets tiring tbf.Some cameos were cool and unexpected (hence my question about the budget). But I am not familiar with most of them and if I ever were I clearly forgot.Didn't know Deadpool could regenerate. Sure explains the cheek on him. Still gets tiring. I don't get the appeal. Sometimes it works, but barely.Watched it cause of all the chatter and cause I like Hugh Jackman.Not bad, not good, I guess the fans would love it?!? I only watched the initial X-Men movies, Logan, maybe the first Deadpool, I can't be certain. So this looks like a cross between DC and Marvel and Disney going by the meta speeches and don't quote me on this cause I never knew what the deal was with the DC or Marvel universe and where does Disney come in, nor do I care. I've watched a couple of Batmans, Spidermans and maybe an Ironman and I mainly did it for the actors, but I was never crazy about the characters or the ""lore"". Some of these movies I liked, when I was much younger. The others were ok, I watched them more recently and they certainly are not my thing.I liked the scenes in between the credits. I did like the first X-Men movie. I wonder if I still would now, had I not seen it.

10,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw10107847/?ref_=tturv_perm_320,The best Gambit movie I've ever watched,"I don't read comics as a hobby. I'm not American. I have no idea what's the fuss about Marvel, DC and superhero movies, I'm not even sure what's Avengars but I'm not completely ignorant and rejective about all these. I like Spiderman and Gambit. I like Spiderman because I had a chance to read some of its issues back in the day and it was fun and funny, and Sam Raimi's Spiderman trilogy were surprisingly good which I know this guy from the Evil Dead series. As for Gambit, I just like him for how cool and fun he is in a Sega Genesis video game called X-Men 2: Clone Wars. If I had to pick only one superhero as my favourite among all these American superheroes it would be Gambit, however for some reasons I have no idea why Gambit never played a role in superhero movies despite they spammed lots of X-Men movies and they spam movies for other characters I never heard of. They always focus on this Batman looking old man who can turn his neck compared to Batman called Wolverine which he is rather dull and therefore boring. I never picked Wolverine when I played X-Men 2: Clone Wars because other characters are more interesting.Then why I did watch this movie? I seriously had no idea there was Gambit in it, I just watch Deadpool movies for its fun because the guy is huge fun meme so seeing Gambit taking a huge role in its own context in this movie was a great surprise but most importantly this is the only movie that Gambit is in it for real so excuse me for I ignored this is supposed to be a Deadpool movie but liked it as it's a Gambit movie therefore my score is 10/10.As a Deadpool movie, it was even way worse than the previous movie so my score is 1/10. They sucked all potential of Deadpool in his first movie so dry there is not enough juice left to develop an entertaining Deadpool movie since the 1st movie, all they do now is milking the audience and they seem very willing like a cow. They knew this movie would be bad because they just had the idea of ""Deadpool and Wolverine"" but they didn't know what else to do about it so to attract attention in any way possible they even put Gambit in it so people like me wouldn't write a complete bad review on it and they would call their other Gambit fan friends and recommend them to watch this movie so they can make more money. Without Gambit there is no significant good aspect in this movie for me as Deadpool was still Deadpool but it wasn't satisfactory enough to not regret buying a ticket for this movie and wasting your time watching it even for Gambit scenes that I could watch on Youtube for free but I know many people who would buy a ticket to watch him on the big screen. They used Wolverine more as a form of entertainment and I dislike this guy and therefore it made me dislike most of this movie which is why it's risky to manage a target audience by implementing characters that divide the target audience. I would rather watch the previous Deadpool movie again if I knew how bad this movie is especially because Deadpool fun is almost non-existence in this movie. The whole Deadpool fun in this movie is in the opening scene and after that scene you can safely stop watching the movie because it's actually Wolvirine's movie that Deadpool is background decor that talks a lot.Lastly I wanna mention, the movie compares Wolverine and Deadpool in any way possible and they made Wolverine win in every aspect as there is a huge Wolverine fan girl love showered in this movie which will bother his haters a lot in this movie. They really did anything to make Deadpool look bad just to make Wolverine look good for sense of humour. I just cannot believe even Wolverine won the who is smarter contest over Deadpool. If you are so fan girl you should have made the name of the movie just ""Wolverine"".",Helpful,•,0,0,naroiden,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur65598730/?ref_=tturv_usr_320_t,3-Nov-24,

8,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9918543/?ref_=tturv_perm_322,"Deadpool would say, 'An Orgasmic Experience'","Remember back in 2022 when Dr Strange: Multiverse of Madness came out? That was when everyone was so pumped up after No Way Home that they were expecting another bang from the MCU? Especially when 'Multiverse' was attached to it, everyone thought they would be tons of cameos, many WOW moments and the scope would be bigger before everyone was kinda disappointed because it was not what we expected it to be though... the film is still good. Just the hype that actually killed the film.Now, after watching Deadpool & Wolverine, it felt like Disney and MCU had learned from that because oh boy, everything you wanted in Dr Strange back in 2022, you will get it here in this third installment. This is a love letter to all the fans. It's a movie that's going to SAVE future MCU movies. From the moment the film began, we knew that everyone in it had so much fun making this. It's quirky, it's jaunty and it's all about giving back to the society.Did I hear cameos? Yeppy, the number of cameos here is the one you would be satisfied with. It's a lot for a 2-hour film. And what's great is that the cameos aren't just limited to the characters, but also to objects, physical references, locations and etc. A lot of the brainstorming and creative processes go to making sure they bring the best out of these cameos. And believe us when we say that they honour the cameos so much more they what they did for Multiverse of Madness. They took note and made sure they delivered the cameos the right way that it should be.Previous Deadpool showed a lot of gore. Now, add Wolverine into it and this is the goriest we've seen MCU pulled in their movie since Iron Man 1. It's satisfying. What we've been hoping from Disney not to tone down anything, they even made this one even better. Blood is this movie's middle name and we're in for a treat.Is the plot interesting enough? Well, it's a bit more complicated to answer this one. Definitely, this is a fun wild ride from beginning until the end, it's like walking down the memory lane. But we cannot overlook that this film does rely on those cameos and fan services to make an impact in its storytelling. Throw all the fan services out there, will it still be good? Might be but it will be another post-covid MCU film. But hey, one thing's for sure, it opens to A LOT of doors for future MCU films. The right doors. But hey, Deadpool & Wolverine has plenty to look out for. The stakes are higher, the villain is formidable and the titular characters' arcs are just golden.Deadpool being Deadpool, it's such a treat watching him having fun. It really feels like Deadpool is directing this movie. And writing it. And putting all the jokes in it. All the jokes are mostly on point. Some are verbally explicit, some really got us laughing out loud, some are even fresh from the oven, it's unheard of. The movie really knows what the fans want.But one thing to note of, you need to have a good pop culture knowledge for you to understand a lot of the jokes or references here. This may be a downside for some especially the general audience. It is a bit hard if you don't follow the current trends or news that's happening. You may be left a tad bit confused.While the fun is there, sometimes they might be having too much fun? To the extent that some scenes felt way too parodied. It took us out from the experience a bit. The CGI felt off at times, with the scenes and contexts became too ridiculous. It's like they had total freedom to do what they wanted without really thinking through where the story should go next. I mean, having total freedom is a rare but great thing in Hollywood but if it's too much, then it's too much.Adding to that, it did feel like it was a 'free roam' film. It's not properly thought out through. It's empty at times, relying on cameos and jokes to sustain audience's interest. It's sort of like a museum filled with artifacts and vintages and rarely seen treasures but there wasn't really a strong cohesive narrative to end it with a bang. It meanders without a clear direction for the bigger scope of the MCU. Not to say that the plot isn't interesting, it still is but just not on par with everything else we're getting in this film.You might think this is a nitpick but we felt there's one particular music that is in the track list that had so much potential but was enormously wasted. They could have done so much more with the song! Like, SO MUCH MORE. Why put it out there if you're gonna properly use it? Might as well just cut the song entirely. Such a wasted opportunity. Sigh.Verdict: Deadpool & Wolverine is like a fanboy's wildest dream come true! It's the ultimate love letter, packing in all the juicy stuff we wished for from Dr. Strange: Multiverse of Madness-think epic cameos, fan service galore, and gore that makes Iron Man look like a teetotaler. It's a zany, nostalgic joyride that flings open doors for future MCU madness. If you're itching to relive the epic feels of Infinity War, Endgame, and No Way Home, buckle up, buttercup-you're in for a rollercoaster of epicness.

Does it live up to the nearly infinite amount of hype? Well just keep reading to find out. DEADPOOL & WOLVERINE is a movie with SO many surprises and spoilers in it, it would be very tough to go into this blind. Don't worry, I won't spoil a single damn thing for all you fine people reading this. As a die-hard Marvel fan, this review will probably seem biased, but that's just a part of who I am. Even though I haven't read a single Marvel comic book, I have ingested everything they have released since 2008's IRON MAN, even some from before that. This is a buddy movie between two actual buddies, Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool and Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. Both were born to play these roles. This is Hugh's 10th time as Wolverine, and he hasn't lost a single ab- I mean step. Ryan is literally the ""Merc with the Mouth"", he's just getting paid to be himself at this point. I'm not going to say anything about the plot, other than the fact that it's the weakest link of this movie. Saying that, I loved literally everything else. It has extremely profane language, has extremely satisfying violent action scenes, and is fantastically funny. There are an absolute litany of cameos that I can't even mention here, all so good. Emma Corrin plays a great villain, whose name I can't even say. This is what Marvel fans have been asking for for a very long time now. It's fan-service up the ass, pardon my Deadpool-ness. There are a lot of ""in jokes"" about companies like Disney and Fox, and for comic book nerds. To understand all the jokes, I recommend watching DEADPOOL 2, LOGAN, and season one of LOKI. I gotta stop myself here before Kevin Feige starts hunting me down. Will DEADPOOL & WOLVERINE save the MCU? Only time will tell. Is DEADPOOL & WOLVERINE a must-see for any fan who has waned a bit because of the 5-year quality dip from Marvel? Let's f***ing go!

6,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9945881/?ref_=tturv_perm_327,I guess if Deadpool became a musician now his songs would have multi verses?,"In recent years it's become a trend to hate on marvel and the films they've put out of late and I have to admit to jumping on that bandwagon. I've had a think about what it really is about marvel that I've come to dislike and I've come to the conclusion it's how insanely popular their movies became. So popular in fact that it got to a point that Marvel properties were the only films bringing in the big bucks at the box office. So much so that cinemas seemed inundated with superhero films and little else.More recently however they've experienced a fall from grace as often things do after a prolonged period of such success. There's been a marked drop in the quality of the films and series they've been putting out with their focus seemingly on quantity rather than quality.With all that being said there's something about Ryan Reynolds in that tight red suit that's captured the hearts of film goers.This third Deadpool film has been on a lot of people's most anticipated films of the year list despite the overall excitement for new marvel releases having been low of late.Now I really enjoyed the previous two Deadpool films but I have to say that for me this was the weakest of the three.Despite all the marketing and even the title of this film focusing on the addition of Wolverine, make no mistake this is very much a Deadpool film.Logan in my opinion was a perfect end to Jackman's tenure as the clawed crusader and if I'm honest outside of marketing it felt somewhat unnecessary for him to reprise the role.He's in most of the film but the reason for him being there in terms of plot progression seemed lacking and other than lost marketing and fan service this film wouldn't have been much different without him.I don't think it brings down Jackman's X-Men and Wolverine films in any way but it just feels unnecessary, even if it's a paring that will in no doubt be loved amongst the marvel faithful.Perhaps the biggest issue I had with this film was Deadpool entering into the MCU and how that plays out. To avoid spoilers I'll just say that the TVA are involved and when you start messing about with timelines it often makes things confusing and not in an enjoyable way like in Inception.Being that Fox is now owned by Disney this may not have been a choice that the creatives behind the film had any control over. It no doubt meant that the budget was bigger but the stakes felt far smaller and it felt like the narrative was an afterthought to Deadpool and Wolverines relationship.After seeing the film I feel that Deadpool would have been better off staying out of the MCU.On a more positive note Ryan Reynolds is on fine form as the quick witted merc with a mouth and I can't help but appreciate how much effort he put into leaki... I mean getting these films made.He's created a character that's become so beloved it was enough to bring Hugh Jackman back as Wolverine which in itself speaks volumes. He's like a joke machine gun constantly blasting the audience with both surface level humour and deep cut references that only a handful of people will get. I don't know if it's just because it's the third film and maybe the shine is starting to wear off but I found the humour a little overbearing at times to the point where it made the more serious scenes harder to appreciate.The action is as slick and gory as ever and there's a number of cameos that Marvel super fans will surely lap up.Overall this film is pretty much exactly what I imagined a Disney owned Deadpool film might look like.A big budget blockbuster that feels somewhat estranged from its routes.",Helpful,•,3,7,TomTalksFilms,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur125201937/?ref_=tturv_usr_327_t,9-Aug-24,

His birthday is crashed by the Time Variance Authority who offer to bring him into a world where he will be recognized, but in that process, his world that has everyone he cares about gets destroyed. After refusing the offer, Wade is sent to the Void and forced to work with the ""worst"" Wolverine to save his own world.That is just the surface of what happens in this crazy movie.I had a great time with Deadpool and Wolverine. It is far from perfect, but I was never bored with this movie. Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman are a match made in heaven with their chemistry. They play off each other perfectly with Deadpool's crazy comedic antics and Wolverine's serious, deadpan expressions. It is cool to see them finally star in a movie together as the titular characters. Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool is exactly how I expected him to be. Reynolds is hilarious and badass in this role, but he also has some great emotional moments, especially concerning his friends in his universe. Some of his humor could be a little cringy at times, especially in the beginning, but Reynolds does a great job here. Hugh Jackman however steals the show. Jackman has a lot of great facial expressions and subtle moments of emotion that can say so much about this version of Wolverine, but his dialogue delivery is on point. His rant towards Deadpool is absolute gold with how vicious and somewhat accurate it is with how his selfish actions and big mouth led them to a low moment. Wolverine is the heart of the movie overall and Jackman absolutely kills it bringing the best emotional beats in the film. Reynolds and Jackman are awesome in this movie and I could see them do another movie together, maybe without their superhero suits.Cassandra Nova is an excellent villain. She is a force of nature who is the perfect villain for two heroes who seem nearly invulnerable to fight. Her psychic powers make her legitimately threatening and frightening. Also, her personality is evil for the sake of petty for the most part and I admire her evilness. Her first scene represents her dangerous and vile nature beautifully and it is one of the best introductions to a villain I have seen in a comic book movie in a while. Emma Corrin nailed this villain. They have a blast hamming it up and snarking while also proving to be a frightening screen presence. Corrin makes this character fun and intense to watch while making us root against Nova. Cassandra Nova is by far the best villain in the Deadpool movies and one of the best in the MCU.The supporting cast is not who I expected to be and this is where it gets a little spoilery. Deadpool's friends are sidelined in this film aside from Peter who is absolutely delightful in the few scenes he is in. Vanessa is unfortunately wasted again and it is a shame because I always thought her relationship with Wade was one of the best parts about the first film. The rest of his friends are mostly at Deadpool's birthday party.Instead of Deadpool's friends, most of the supporting characters are past superheroes from Marvel movies from Fox or other studios. The actors from those roles reprise them here. Everyone is game and there is a standout here for me. I love that they got so many stars to come back despite it being years since they played these roles and they are mostly treated with dignity and they come off as cool and heroic. The cast is fantastic and they make this movie so fun to watch.The story is very fun and often engaging. As a multiverse movie, it has a lot of references to past comic book movie heroes, a lot of which were from the 20th Century Fox Marvel movies. They are handled pretty well despite a few cameos of them being little more than jokes because they are utilized like characters in a trapped world. The original actors for these characters return and they make the most of their appearances injecting life into them. A couple of the cameos really surprised me. While the movie does feel bigger than a simple sequel to Deadpool 2, this is still his story about his quest to save his friends and his love-hate friendship with Wolverine.Behind all of the nostalgia and references lies a story about working towards a better future and not dwelling on the past. Also, despite Deadpool wanting to have more of a purpose, he is not willing to make a deal that will destroy his family making this also a film about family coming first. The story is far from perfect, but it is executed far better than I thought it would be for a movie that takes place in a multiverse.The tone of the movie mixes the comedic craziness of Deadpool and the serious and dark past of the ""worst"" Wolverine. On paper, this sounds like a recipe that could clash with each other, but Shawn Levy does a good job balancing comedy, action and drama here. The dramatic parts are never compromised by the comedy in this movie which makes them more effective. The humor is hilarious for the most part. There are several lines of dialogue and moments of physical comedy that cracked me up, especially some of the references and how they are used. A couple of cringy lines poking fun of Disney aside (they go on just a bit too long), this is probably the most that I laughed at a film since Abigail. The pacing is overall pretty fast even though the first 20 minutes are a bit on the slow side. Once Deadpool searches for Wolverine, the movie goes by at a brisk pace, but it never feels rushed.Visually, it is a bit of a mixed bag. The costumes are amazing. The Deadpool costume is as lively and expressive as ever, but Wolverine's costume looks very cool too. It could have come off as too cartoony, but it does not. The action scenes are very entertaining to watch and beautifully shot and edited, especially one fight right before the climax and the battle with Deadpool and Wolverine's new squad. The action gets very bloody and graphic even compared to the first two Deadpool movies, but that is what makes it more entertaining for me because this movie holds nothing back. There is one scene that had me shook a little bit because it came out of nowhere. The special effects look pretty good for the most part aside from a few moments of iffy CGI, and the fight choreography is on point, especially the duels between Deadpool against Wolverine.The sets could have been a little more colorful and lively. I get that the movie was going for a desperate and post-apocalyptic vibe with the Void, but it looks nowhere near as impressive as the likes of Dune: Part Two and Furiosa. There are some cool sets like the snowy area in the opening scene and Cassandra's hideout, but I expected the locations to look more impressive for a Marvel movie. The cinematography features some great looking shots that are a bit hindered by the monochromatic colors of the environment, but colorful characters pop. The most impressive looking shot is a long-take fight scene in the third act that feels like a comic book come to life. The soundtrack is awesome. As far as a movie with multiple songs goes, this movie probably has the best soundtrack of the year. I cannot say what I liked more: Deadpool and Wolverine fighting to AC/DC's ""Hell's Bells"" or them fighting to ""You're the One that I Want"" from Grease! Seriously, whoever put those song choices in those fights deserves a raise.Aside from the flaws and a couple visuals that could have looked better, I had a great time with this movie. Deadpool and Wolverine is a blast to watch. The opening scene alone had me pumped up for the rest of the film. Ryan Reynolds brought this character to life in this entire trilogy and I am grateful he showed how funny and badass of a character Deadpool is. These three movies brought a lot of joy in the theater for both me and my mom. I can tell that everyone involved in this movie had just as much fun making it and it shows in every second.",Helpful,•,3,1,jaredkjacoby,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur111679790/?ref_=tturv_usr_329_t,5-Aug-24,
8,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9972445/?ref_=tturv_perm_330,Bloody humorous,"In 2016, we were shown a superhero from the Marvel universe like we've never seen before. Ryan Reynolds took on the role of Wade Wilson, who becomes the immortal superhero Deadpool after a terrible accident. But Deadpool is not just a superhero, he is rude and particularly violent. In the distance, the whole thing was a bit reminiscent of Kick-Ass that had a kind of equal concept. The first Deadpool- film was so successful that there was a sequel in 2018. Deadpool 2 built on the same concept and was also a great success. Then came Avengers: End Game in 2019 and actually it went downhill with the Marvel movies. Although Deadpool didn't directly have to do with that part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it did have immediate effect, because although everyone was waiting for a third Deadpool- movie, it took us six years to welcome a sequel. It also meant the return for Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, who already hung his metal claws in the willows in 2017. You will immediately wonder how this will be solved since Wolverine is really dead.Of course, Wolverine returns because Deadpool brings him back from another world of a different timeline. Bad luck for Deadpool that he just brings back the most terrible Wolverine you can think of. Because of this timeline trick, it is a breeze for Marvel to be able to bring every superhero back of course and whether you should really want that remains a bit of the question. The film is entertaining and full of humor, but at the same time we can feel Disney's nasty woke hand. Fortunately, there is still some stab to do, but Disney has proven with The Acolyte, for example, that she is even the largest franchise capable of turning the neck. Fortunately, that doesn't happen in this Deadpool- movie yet, but Deadpool & Wolverine is completely deviated from its predecessors. The return of some almost forgotten superheroes who come to help Deadpool and Wolverine is very nice to see. Deadpool really wants to join the Avengers, but is not assumed there, it will eventually mean that Deadpool will end up in the counterpart of the Avengers and hopefully that will be a greater success than what Marvel has been working on lately.Of course, the film bursts with ridicule, but in a positive way. Especially the scene in which more than a hundred Deadpools from different timelines come together is a highly entertaining, but extremely bloody course. This was also quite clear in the opening of the film and that a film like this grave, necrophily and all that kind of thing does not shy away from it, may be clear. It is advisable for deeply believing people or people with a weak stomach to skip the film, because Deadpool is not for the dear souls. It remains to be seen what a possible next part will bring, because who saw such a crossover film between Deadpool and Wolverine actually coming, at least I didn't. Hopefully Marvel will climb out of the deep valley of some ridiculously bad movies they made, but I also had that hope after the fantastic third part of Guardians of the Galaxy and then we got Madam Web. Anyway we are going to experience it.Deadpool & Wolverine has become a bloody, coarse, humorous roller coaster ride. The opening of the film alone is not for dear souls or heavily believing people. Hopefully this is a turnaround in the Marvel universe that falters on all sides. After Avengers: End Game, with a few exceptions, no decent movie came and Disney also wanted to kill you by adding a lot of series to the MCU. But if Disney is good at one thing, it's killing successful franchises, just look at the Star Wars franchise. Hopefully this doesn't apply to the MCU and it's the anti-hero Deadpool who has to pull things out of the mud again. Either way, this may not be the best Deadpool movie, but it has everything on board that makes it worth a ride to the cinema. So if you haven't seen the movie yet and you feel like an evening of brainless stupid entertainment, Deadpool & Wolverine is the right choice.",Helpful,•,3,6,michvanbeek,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur22969565/?ref_=tturv_usr_330_t,24-Aug-24,

Hence, you are never really concerned for their safety. Nobody died during the production to my knowledge so there was no need to be concerned.Plot: The same thing as above. This isn't the usual story movie, this is a commentary about the current state of things in Disney and Hollywood. You could watch a Doomcock video just as well.

It was fun for a while with sliders but, like time travel, it's become a cheap trick. The MCU now uses both time travel and multiverse elements is a very messy way.So I haven't been that interested in DP2 due to the time travel aspect. And DP&W, along with Marvel in general, with the combination of time travel and multiverses has become nonsensical. There wasn't much else of interest in DP&W either. I am OK with gore when it fits in the plot. But there is so much in this movie which was clearly there just for spectacle. And most of the dialog and jokes were not interesting nor funny.In the end, this movie was actually depressing. I could have done or watched something which was actually interesting or fun.

3,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9927950/?ref_=tturv_perm_335,Parody of a parody of an in-joke of a fan service of a....,"As someone not unfamiliar with the ""modern era"" of superhero films and now with a good 10 years of superhero fatigue, I found Deadpool 1 and 2 very refreshing - a superhero film that turns the genre on its ear and doesn't take itself too seriously, but has some genuine heart underneath. Additionally, you didn't need to have seen 5+ other films to ""get"" Deadpool as long as you were familiar with the broad characterizations and themes it was poking fun at.I hope you weren't expecting another Deadpool movie. This is a Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) movie that just happens to feature Deadpool. And if you're wondering why that particular distinction is important, well, based on that alone I can honestly say you're probably gonna have a bad time. (And if you just learned what ""MCU"" stands for cause I spelled it out above, abandon all hope. This film is not for you in the least bit.) Other than Ryan Reynolds, the rest of the usual supporting cast of Deadpool 1 and 2 are shown only briefly at the start and then quickly discarded for an endless parade of cameos by other heroes and villains from other Marvel movies. Each appears on-screen to be joke fodder for Reynolds, only to disappear moments later inconsequentially. This is the exact opposite of what Deadpool 1 and 2 achieved - which was an interesting main character, supporting cast and a strong amount of standalone charm.To have any chance of being in on the joke in DEADPOOL AND WOLVERINE, you need to be a veteran of the MCU. You also need to be a veteran of super hero movies going back possibly as far as the '90s since there are jokes about OLD failed franchise attempts like Elektra, and others which fizzled out, like Blade. You need to be a veteran of the Wolverine character and his various appearances throughout the years. You need to have followed a lot of the behind-the-scenes corporate acquisitions and drama of the franchises.This is truly a movie that demands you know the ""meta"" in way-too-deep detail. I've probably watched half of the above-mentioned MCU and superhero films, and grew up with the comic books (the Infinity gauntlet storyline came out when I was in high school), but I was still mostly lost and missing many of the inside-baseball jokes and twists. The ones I did fully grasp just weren't very funny or worth the payoff. Throw in the requisite ""clever"" riffs on Millennial and Gen-Z wokeness, where the film essentially disclaims or apologizes for a crude joke in advance before going on to make it anyway, and this film fell utterly flat for me. ""I know we're not supposed to use the c-word anymore, but you're kind of a c-word."" Imagine that said in Ryan Reynold's deliberately smarmy voice and you get the idea. Anyway, funny ha ha, right?The plot is some kind of alternate timeline/alternate universe nonsense to explain bringing back dead characters. Or something like that. The film isn't even clear on whether it's embracing or parodying this overused retcon mechanism but it resulted in an immediate audience tune out, yours truly included, and I stopped trying to figure it out as I mentally recounted how much money I just wasted. It was simultaneously too thin and thrown together, but also head-scratchingly too convoluted - because of course it has to jump through MCU hoops and rules to ""make sense"". And I am NOT kidding. If you so dare, search for ""TVA Marvel"" and prepare to go down a mega-nerd rabbit hole. I read comics as an 80s kid when the TVA was created and even I thought it was a bunch of hokey BS at age 11. But if something called ""the sacred timeline"" makes your nerd-o-meter beep madly and whip into a frenzy, you're going to love it, trust me. Anyway, it doesn't really matter because the ramshackle plot just serves to hang the zillions of cameos.Some are saying this film is filled with easter eggs but I would disagree. Easter eggs are extra little things that fans will notice but aren't necessary to enjoy the main story. Here, they're the whole point, so if you're missing them there's absolutely nothing for you. On the flipside, MCU nerds will bask in the smugness. To the tune of, ""It's a great film if you're familiar enough with the genre to appreciate it, but otherwise you can be forgiven for incorrectly thinking it's a bad film."" Folks, I'm at least 75% in this film's target audience crosshairs and let me spare you the confusion: it's a BAD film.Do you like 4th wall breaks? Oh boy, is your 15-year-old comic-con sense of humor in for a treat, because Ryan Reynolds abuses the heck out of these. You could make a sort of drinking game out of how many times Reynolds breaks the 4th wall because if one or two 4th wall breaks is hilarious, certainly 10 or 20 is comedy gold, right?In the void of zero character development, fortune cookie plot and rapid-fire wisecrack dialog that says mostly nothing, the action scenes lost all gravitas and became the usual computer-generated eye candy that gets wearisome after the first couple battles. In other words, one of the main culprits for why this entire genre has been deflating for the last several years like a 2-day-old Dollar Tree balloon. The two main characters punch, kick and stab each other endlessly, but also pointlessly, since they're pretty much invulnerable. Thus, their fights are meaningless and there's zero at stake. They could have made these fights funny or inventive or jaw-droppingly cool to make up for it. But they didn't.That's obviously subjective, but the fights are so slick, with no sense of impact, force, gravity, urgency or consequence, they're the action fight analog to American Cheese. It's a high production video game, nothing more. To obscure that we're seeing yet another who-cares superhero fight, they're set to various nostalgic pop tunes like Nsyncs Bye Bye Bye. Okay, that's a cheap gimmick but it can work. Yet unfortunately they were lazy about it. He doesn't kick three guys in a Bruce Lee ballet to the ""Bye Bye Bye"" lyrics. There's just occasional breaks in the action to watch Reynolds boy-band dance, and then it's back to the rote action. So unless you have the prerequisite awkward middle-school dance memories of circa 2000 Nsync, prepare to be underwhelmed.Also, there's a disturbing number of swords/claws stabbed into private parts, as if doing so is automatic comedy gold or edgy or envelope-pushing or who knows. It's just cheap and dumb. Such gimmicks are this film's adolescent way of reveling in its R-ratedness. If you're a veteran of PG-13 MCU films, this stabby pee pee joke humor might at least seem novel, or be evidence that the Disney MCU is ready to ""grow up"", but if you're coming from the direction of the previous DEADPOOL (already R-Rated) films or TV-M series like THE BOYS, you'll yawn and cringe at all the try-hard teenage boy badassery.This film can't decide if it's a parody, fan service or just an outright slapstick superhero movie and it succeeds at none of them. I have no idea who this movie was made for. Absolutely do not bring your friends unless they have a PhD in the last 20 years of superhero films or you'll spend an hour afterward trying to explain it all to them and sound really lame in the process. Like: ""Wolverine is wearing his costume from the comic books! Can you believe it?!""The rest of the world: ""And?""Some are saying this is the freshest take in the superhero genre in years and breathes new life into it. Not a chance. This film preaches solely to the MCU choir (a choir that is badly out of tune). It's an admittance that these films have painted themselves into a corner of lore inaccessibility and their aging millennial and gen-z audiences are bored with their ""appeal to the widest crowd"" PG-13ness. They are sound and fury and CG and endless one-upping and stakes-raising over young teenage baubles most of us have outgrown. And now, where do they go next?

Let's take it slow because I'm really elated about this film, I start by saying that at first I had a lot of doubts about it since Disney is known to make the most uncomfortable characters much less uncomfortable and at the news that a character like Deadpool was going to pass in the Disney house I was disgusted. I have to do a ""mea culpa"", I apologize because I was prejudiced and I have to say that Disney this time amazed me with a film much more violent and vulgar (absurdly) than the first two Deadpool movies from Fox, I apologize Disney and thank you for finally giving us the duo that all true fans dreamed of, Deadpool and Wolverine and they offer us a super cool and super characterized Wolverine, these two characters on the big screen look really good together. Finally after more than 20 years we also get to see a Wolverine in the original yellow suit, leaving out all the various cameos of the various Wolverines that are one more fantastic than the other really, a lot of comic books put on and seeing the iconic scenes on the big screen makes quite an impression. The plot is not that complex in fact it's very very simple but that's fine with me because I exactly expected to see a lot of beating and a lot of blood, I wanted to have fun and I had fun. This is a movie that entertains and it does it great, with out-of-the-blue cameos and scenes that are so much absurd that they keep the viewer attached to the screen the whole time.

I found DP3 less successful, mainly due to the weaker story. In the first two films, I felt they had a nice balance of humor, action, and story. Both of those movies had serious themes that drove Deadpool through the film. But this third one? The stakes just didn't seem that high. I wasn't the least bit invested in seeing DP and Wolverine succeed. That tension and hope were missing from this third film.I think I wasn't as engaged due to the endless breaking of the fourth wall. This was done in the first two movies, but not to the extent it happens here. It seems like every 5 minutes, someone turns and looks into the camera to make a joke. Many of the jokes are about Fox, Marvel, and Disney. A few are fine, but there are so many that you get yanked out of the story.The trash-talking was also dialed up to an eleven. It's almost like the writers felt they had to do a lot more wall-breaking and tasteless swearing to go beyond the past two films.There are a lot of positives, however. The character cameos are fantastic. I constantly found myself saying ""wow"" everytime someone new came on screen. Kudos to Reynolds and everyone for getting so many great characters from the past to be included in this movie.I also found the fight scenes and VFX to be excellent.

It was everything I hoped for and then some. Without spoiling much I'll just say it is everything fans wanted for the past 25 years in a nutshell down to the last drop. The jokes hit hard, the chemistry between Jackman and Reynolds was stellar and the surprise cameos and action sequences in between and during the plot were highly memorable. I walked out of the theater quoting so many damn lines that were stated and that to me is a staple of a great movie. If I can retain several parts or more of the film well after I watch the credits roll, then you're a true keeper. I guess if I had to dig deep and find anything really lacking in the movie it would be that they really didn't have a big bad villain, albeit traded a big baddy for a more nuanced and vaguely familiar one. Overall, if there was a good, solid theme for this 3rd installment of the Deadpool series I'd say it would be in that it was a nice send off and farewell to the past 25 years of 20th Century Fox Marvel movies and one hell of a Fox homage that I was happy to take part of and show up for with bells on.",,,,,psgorio,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur107731186/?ref_=tturv_usr_352_t,25-Sep-24,
9,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9978840/?ref_=tturv_perm_353,Everything it needed to be and more,"Deadpool and Wolverine has been long in the making over the years in Hollywood and after six long years of waiting since Deadpool 2, I can proudly say that I absolutely loved this film and what it represents to a lot of people. Especially comic book fans like me. After bringing almost everyone back to life using Cables time traveling device in the credits of Deadpool 2, Wade Wilson has stepped down from his vigilante/superhero alias known as Deadpool and becomes a used car salesman after a nasty breakup with Vanessa. When the TVA from Loki comes knocking on his doorstep one day after finding out about his abuse of time travel, Deadpool is brought to the TVA and offered a chance to finally join the MCU like he's always wanted. When the TVA informs him that his universe is dying due to the death of Logan/Wolverine from Logan (2017) and that a statistic TVA Agent known as Mr. Paradox wants to speed up the process of his dying universe in order to protect the Sacred Timeline, it's up to Deadpool to go on a mission throughout the multiverse to recruit a variant of Wolverine to help him save his universe from extinction. So for starters, Ryan Reynolds as Wade Wilson/Deadpool has never been better this time around, while still having some of the same charm from the previous films. Hugh Jackman returning as a new variant of Wolverine was the biggest highlight and standout of the entire film and I will always be grateful that he returned at least one more time to do everything that he has ever wanted to accomplish as the character Wolverine. Especially when it came to his comic accurate costumes from the different variants of Wolverine we see throughout the film. Emma Corrin as Cassandra Nova I thought personally was one of the best villains we have had in the MCU in a long while, even though we didn't get much of a backstory for her character, she still had a menacing presence and also managed to have some of the funniest lines in the whole film, which is hard most of the time to do as a villain. When it comes to the cameos in this movie, I will say without a doubt, this movie did not disappoint at all and did justice for certain characters that will be remembered for years to come. As far as any cons goes, other than a few shots of CGI that I figured was done on purpose for the sake of the film and a few choices of dialogue, there is not much at all to complain about with this film. Overall, Deadpool and Wolverine is the most fan serviced movie I've ever seen in my life, that gave us all everything we could of asked for, while also giving us everything we didn't know we needed as well and will go down as one of the greatest comic book movies of all time.

The deep emotional elements of the last movie are barely seen or they lack the depth to understand them.

This is hard to believe turn of events that can only find some grounds in the Guardians of the Galaxy's end movie.The Logan character is not left to rest, something parodied in the movie, the poor CGI didn't make a good impression of him.

It's a cocktail that blasts as many laughs as it does skulls! It feels like Hugh Jackman and Ryan Reynolds bring everything they do best - yelling and laughing, in that order - to deliver two hours of pure mayhem.The plot? Deadpool sniffs out a major enemy (and a big contract too) and decides to drag Wolverine out of retirement to help. Why? Who knows, but who cares. Shawn Levy does everything to make this unlikely duo work, and honestly, it holds up. It's just an excuse for spot-on jokes and epic brawls that hit all the right notes.They don't hold back here: it's pure, unfiltered fan service, and it's a delight. Between cameos (oh yes, you'll get plenty) and nostalgic throwbacks, it's basically a tribute to everything that makes mutants so iconic. Logan in yellow? You got it. If you grew up with the X-Men and laughed with Deadpool, you'll probably feel like you're seeing your fan dreams come true.Shawn Levy delivers a solid, effective movie, though it indulges in some clichés. Do we mind? Not really, because the actors make up for it, and that's what counts. The film occasionally dips into darker, dramatic territory - Wolverine's touch - but it always snaps back to quips and explosions (Deadpool's specialty this time).The real downside? The villain. You'll forget them as soon as you see them, and they won't be the part that sticks with you. But Deadpool and Wolverine? They're here to own the screen like only seasoned brawlers can.So no, you won't leave Deadpool & Wolverine with a cinematic lesson, but who cares? It's fun, it's bloody, and we want more!

Go into this movie with ZERO spoilers if you can!!

Some of the jokes landed well, the costumes for many characters looked nice, and I love the nostalgic cameos that we get. I like the opening montage where Deadpool dances / kills to N'Sync's ""Bye Bye Bye""; and I like the first fight scene between Deadpool and WolverineSeveral shortcomings prevent the movie from reaching A+ level though. Some of the jokes, particularly the ones involving Fox Network, fall flat. Too much of the movie occurs in The Void, and Professor X's sister is nowhere close to being intimidating or interesting enough to be the primary villain. The whole plot involving ""Anchor Beings"" and multiverses seems lazyMy last criticism is that I just didn't like seeing Jackman reprise his role as Wolverine after Logan. He had the best send-off to his character. Many people defend his return by noting that ""this is another Logan from another universe,"" but I find that nuance to be splitting hairs. The character in this movie is still Wolverine played by Jackman, and we see many references to Logan, including an appearance one specific character. Therefore, the movie does diminish Jackman's sendoff in Logan.",,,,,redban02,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur54385035/?ref_=tturv_usr_363_t,8-Sep-24,

This scene is filled with laughs, violence and gore, which I was glad to see because there are too many films today that make a film less violent or less gory than it should be in order to appeal to a wider audience but actually this makes it less appealing. I also liked this scene because like at the beginning of the first Deadpool film it shows a bit of action and then a bit of back story about what Deadpool has been up to since the prequel and how we got to this epic fight scene.This back story involves Deadpool getting offered a job in the TVA (Time Variance Authority) in order to avoid being in the destruction of his universe's timeline. It's being obliterated because the central being (Wolverine) has died. This plot is a bit far fetched and might seem a bit complicated to someone like me who can't remember much of the Loki series or X-Men films.Although I did enjoy what happened next which was that Deadpool went on a funny journey across the multiverse to find an alternate Wolverine who he can bring back to the TVA and save the day. Along this journey there's loads of action, laughs and references to some epic marvel films which gives you an awesome blast from the past.We also meet another bad guy who is very scary and dangerous which was a relief because the main bad guy who's trying to make sure Deadpool's timeline is destroyed, isn't scary at all and I wish he had have been.I am also glad to say that the other superheroes that give you a blast from the past have a good amount of screen time and definitely join in with the fighting, but I do think that the last fight scene could have been shortened a little in order to give them more screen time and they also could have used this to throw in an epic car chase/race.The end fight scene is almost perfect though and it has even more violence and gore than the first fight scene which means it's definitely worth the wait. An example of how it could have been shortened was a funny shoot 'em up part that went on a little too long and was a bit predictable at the end.But overall I had a great time when watching this film and I would happily watch it again and again, in fact I'm hoping I get another chance to see it in the cinema before they stop showing it. I would also like to see future marvel movies go back to being good because I'm definitely looking forward to the next Spiderman and Captain America films. And I hope that in future marvel movies we get to see more of the other superheroes in this film that just had cameos and I hope they don't change any of the actors that play these heroes.",,,,,mrdanielkanewilliams,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur176601376/?ref_=tturv_usr_367_t,7-Oct-24,

Deadpool and Wolverine surprise with a spectacular tape, full of cameos and great moments of action. It's worth every second and you're gonna laugh a lot.Director Shawn Levy did a sensational job, being well directed and with a well-sustained narrative argument in the multiverse aspect, even better performed than in ""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness"". Deadpool 3 is great in the way it unfolds at certain points in the script because of the universes that Marvel has presented for many years, giving a close to the Deadpool trilogy and some way to do it. This sequel is a barbarity for the mutant fans and for those who saw many characters from the editorial in their live action films of the 2000's, applying nostalgia and many surprises to the plot of the film.Ryan Reynolds's great work should be highlighted, whether from his production, script and acting as Wade Wilson. The actor makes it excellent and once again brings to the table the character character comedy like in Deadpool 1 and 2. On the other hand Hugh Jackman as Logan once again is of the best that can have a Marvel tape, the actor demonstrates that he was born to be the character and in this sequel shines through each scene, showing another variant of Wolverine more wild and epic for the big screen.In the special effects section Deadpool and Wolverine has an excellent job. A CGI that possesses an extraordinary level of detail worthy of a mercenary film. These approaches can also be highlighted camera, soundtrack, photography, assembly and staging.However, all that addition of characters and cameos to the tape are one of the key points to keep the hype for each viewer, being some very well performed and others wasted in different scenes. Still, Deadpool helps in this argument by giving those more than logical jokes that really help answer your doubts.

They continued to be bored at a lot of ""jokes"" that never landed. It's like everyone waited for the next cameo and a handful of funny parts to show any sort of excitement. Half of the laughing always came from the same five percent of the audience, whereas everyone agreed that seeing the cameos was the bright spots of the mess of a storyline.I didn't hate the movie because, thankfully, there were some fun moments, but they serve to only satisfy you in the moment. Even good parts were underscored with stupidity. Usually this was the case where a funny line or visual gag would happen, but there would be a dumb setup or poor reveal. The Paul Rudd joke was funny, because the line of dialogue, but not the setup. This halfway attempt at comedy permeated all 2 hours. The song selection is all over the place and, even though I personally didn't like many of the songs, they didn't fit with the tone of the movie. Why did they have to ruin good action scenes with terrible songs! At least most everything with Wolverine was entertaining and a few fantastic moments with Hugh Jackman.With villains that are confusingly good, an over complicated yet simple story, scenes that drag on, multiple instances of things not making sense, or characters that aren't needed, and a multitude of other things that I would list as choices I would be ashamed to have written, at the very least we get a better Mad Max movie than Furiosa.

After that there were a string of R rated films. Sure Deadpool is an R rated character that did well under Fox, but would Walt approve of this film, who knows. Now don't get me wrong, I already knew what this was all about as I had seen the first two films as well. I honestly thought they were okay, and I knew what this was going to be too.

It was everything I hoped for and then some. Without spoiling much I'll just say it is everything fans wanted for the past 25 years in a nutshell down to the last drop. The jokes hit hard, the chemistry between Jackman and Reynolds was stellar and the surprise cameos and action sequences in between and during the plot were highly memorable. I walked out of the theater quoting so many damn lines that were stated and that to me is a staple of a great movie. If I can retain several parts or more of the film well after I watch the credits roll, then you're a true keeper. I guess if I had to dig deep and find anything really lacking in the movie it would be that they really didn't have a big bad villain, albeit traded a big baddy for a more nuanced and vaguely familiar one. Overall, if there was a good, solid theme for this 3rd installment of the Deadpool series I'd say it would be in that it was a nice send off and farewell to the past 25 years of 20th Century Fox Marvel movies and one hell of a Fox homage that I was happy to take part of and show up for with bells on.",Helpful,•,7,9,psgorio,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur107731186/?ref_=tturv_usr_352_t,26-Sep-24,
9,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9978840/?ref_=tturv_perm_353,Everything it needed to be and more,"Deadpool and Wolverine has been long in the making over the years in Hollywood and after six long years of waiting since Deadpool 2, I can proudly say that I absolutely loved this film and what it represents to a lot of people. Especially comic book fans like me. After bringing almost everyone back to life using Cables time traveling device in the credits of Deadpool 2, Wade Wilson has stepped down from his vigilante/superhero alias known as Deadpool and becomes a used car salesman after a nasty breakup with Vanessa. When the TVA from Loki comes knocking on his doorstep one day after finding out about his abuse of time travel, Deadpool is brought to the TVA and offered a chance to finally join the MCU like he's always wanted. When the TVA informs him that his universe is dying due to the death of Logan/Wolverine from Logan (2017) and that a statistic TVA Agent known as Mr. Paradox wants to speed up the process of his dying universe in order to protect the Sacred Timeline, it's up to Deadpool to go on a mission throughout the multiverse to recruit a variant of Wolverine to help him save his universe from extinction. So for starters, Ryan Reynolds as Wade Wilson/Deadpool has never been better this time around, while still having some of the same charm from the previous films. Hugh Jackman returning as a new variant of Wolverine was the biggest highlight and standout of the entire film and I will always be grateful that he returned at least one more time to do everything that he has ever wanted to accomplish as the character Wolverine. Especially when it came to his comic accurate costumes from the different variants of Wolverine we see throughout the film. Emma Corrin as Cassandra Nova I thought personally was one of the best villains we have had in the MCU in a long while, even though we didn't get much of a backstory for her character, she still had a menacing presence and also managed to have some of the funniest lines in the whole film, which is hard most of the time to do as a villain. When it comes to the cameos in this movie, I will say without a doubt, this movie did not disappoint at all and did justice for certain characters that will be remembered for years to come. As far as any cons goes, other than a few shots of CGI that I figured was done on purpose for the sake of the film and a few choices of dialogue, there is not much at all to complain about with this film. Overall, Deadpool and Wolverine is the most fan serviced movie I've ever seen in my life, that gave us all everything we could of asked for, while also giving us everything we didn't know we needed as well and will go down as one of the greatest comic book movies of all time.

It feels like Hugh Jackman and Ryan Reynolds bring everything they do best - yelling and laughing, in that order - to deliver two hours of pure mayhem.The plot? Deadpool sniffs out a major enemy (and a big contract too) and decides to drag Wolverine out of retirement to help. Why? Who knows, but who cares. Shawn Levy does everything to make this unlikely duo work, and honestly, it holds up. It's just an excuse for spot-on jokes and epic brawls that hit all the right notes.They don't hold back here: it's pure, unfiltered fan service, and it's a delight. Between cameos (oh yes, you'll get plenty) and nostalgic throwbacks, it's basically a tribute to everything that makes mutants so iconic. Logan in yellow? You got it. If you grew up with the X-Men and laughed with Deadpool, you'll probably feel like you're seeing your fan dreams come true.Shawn Levy delivers a solid, effective movie, though it indulges in some clichés. Do we mind? Not really, because the actors make up for it, and that's what counts. The film occasionally dips into darker, dramatic territory - Wolverine's touch - but it always snaps back to quips and explosions (Deadpool's specialty this time).The real downside? The villain. You'll forget them as soon as you see them, and they won't be the part that sticks with you. But Deadpool and Wolverine? They're here to own the screen like only seasoned brawlers can.So no, you won't leave Deadpool & Wolverine with a cinematic lesson, but who cares? It's fun, it's bloody, and we want more!

Some of the jokes, particularly the ones involving Fox Network, fall flat. Too much of the movie occurs in The Void, and Professor X's sister is nowhere close to being intimidating or interesting enough to be the primary villain. The whole plot involving ""Anchor Beings"" and multiverses seems lazyMy last criticism is that I just didn't like seeing Jackman reprise his role as Wolverine after Logan. He had the best send-off to his character. Many people defend his return by noting that ""this is another Logan from another universe,"" but I find that nuance to be splitting hairs. The character in this movie is still Wolverine played by Jackman, and we see many references to Logan, including an appearance one specific character.

This scene is filled with laughs, violence and gore, which I was glad to see because there are too many films today that make a film less violent or less gory than it should be in order to appeal to a wider audience but actually this makes it less appealing. I also liked this scene because like at the beginning of the first Deadpool film it shows a bit of action and then a bit of back story about what Deadpool has been up to since the prequel and how we got to this epic fight scene.This back story involves Deadpool getting offered a job in the TVA (Time Variance Authority) in order to avoid being in the destruction of his universe's timeline. It's being obliterated because the central being (Wolverine) has died. This plot is a bit far fetched and might seem a bit complicated to someone like me who can't remember much of the Loki series or X-Men films.Although I did enjoy what happened next which was that Deadpool went on a funny journey across the multiverse to find an alternate Wolverine who he can bring back to the TVA and save the day. Along this journey there's loads of action, laughs and references to some epic marvel films which gives you an awesome blast from the past.We also meet another bad guy who is very scary and dangerous which was a relief because the main bad guy who's trying to make sure Deadpool's timeline is destroyed, isn't scary at all and I wish he had have been.I am also glad to say that the other superheroes that give you a blast from the past have a good amount of screen time and definitely join in with the fighting, but I do think that the last fight scene could have been shortened a little in order to give them more screen time and they also could have used this to throw in an epic car chase/race.The end fight scene is almost perfect though and it has even more violence and gore than the first fight scene which means it's definitely worth the wait. An example of how it could have been shortened was a funny shoot 'em up part that went on a little too long and was a bit predictable at the end.But overall I had a great time when watching this film and I would happily watch it again and again, in fact I'm hoping I get another chance to see it in the cinema before they stop showing it. I would also like to see future marvel movies go back to being good because I'm definitely looking forward to the next Spiderman and Captain America films.

It's worth every second and you're gonna laugh a lot.Director Shawn Levy did a sensational job, being well directed and with a well-sustained narrative argument in the multiverse aspect, even better performed than in ""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness"". Deadpool 3 is great in the way it unfolds at certain points in the script because of the universes that Marvel has presented for many years, giving a close to the Deadpool trilogy and some way to do it. This sequel is a barbarity for the mutant fans and for those who saw many characters from the editorial in their live action films of the 2000's, applying nostalgia and many surprises to the plot of the film.Ryan Reynolds's great work should be highlighted, whether from his production, script and acting as Wade Wilson. The actor makes it excellent and once again brings to the table the character character comedy like in Deadpool 1 and 2. On the other hand Hugh Jackman as Logan once again is of the best that can have a Marvel tape, the actor demonstrates that he was born to be the character and in this sequel shines through each scene, showing another variant of Wolverine more wild and epic for the big screen.In the special effects section Deadpool and Wolverine has an excellent job. A CGI that possesses an extraordinary level of detail worthy of a mercenary film. These approaches can also be highlighted camera, soundtrack, photography, assembly and staging.However, all that addition of characters and cameos to the tape are one of the key points to keep the hype for each viewer, being some very well performed and others wasted in different scenes.

Half of the laughing always came from the same five percent of the audience, whereas everyone agreed that seeing the cameos was the bright spots of the mess of a storyline.I didn't hate the movie because, thankfully, there were some fun moments, but they serve to only satisfy you in the moment. Even good parts were underscored with stupidity. Usually this was the case where a funny line or visual gag would happen, but there would be a dumb setup or poor reveal. The Paul Rudd joke was funny, because the line of dialogue, but not the setup. This halfway attempt at comedy permeated all 2 hours. The song selection is all over the place and, even though I personally didn't like many of the songs, they didn't fit with the tone of the movie.

He built Disney and the Disney name to have value when it comes to the family. In 1984 when Disney launched Touchstone Pictures to release the Tom Hanks film Splash, they didn't want to release it under the Disney heading because it had nudity and some foul language. After that there were a string of R rated films. Sure Deadpool is an R rated character that did well under Fox, but would Walt approve of this film, who knows. Now don't get me wrong, I already knew what this was all about as I had seen the first two films as well. I honestly thought they were okay, and I knew what this was going to be too.

Which isn't a bad thing, just means if you're like me and don't get all 1000 references, it's going to be a bumpy ride for you. I got a lot of them. It suffers the Rick and Morty, Smiling Friends, current era humor problem of needing 100 jokes per minute and as such there's really a weak semblance of a plot and story. It was weirdly ""CUTE"" which given the amount of swearing and violence, is weird to say. I wouldn't say I regretted seeing it opening day, but would say, this is a STREAMING movie. That way you can rewind parts to see the jokes and easter eggs you've missed.The pros:
-Obviously the CHEMISTRY between two of the nicest people in Hollywood from what I've heard. It's great. Though they did have a few character breaks where it clearly was like take 100 and they didn't have the budget to retake something anymore so you'll catch a Hugh Jackman smirk here or there when he's supposed to be pissed off. Pretty sure Happy Hogan has a MAJOR character break in his scene.-Decent effects
-Good jokes
-Some obscure out of left field references, like the ""Leifeld Foot Store"". Rob Leifeld co-created Deadpool.Cons:
-Over stays its welcome
-Blind old lady that's hood is kind of a tired old trope, I mean Airplane did that joke and it was getting old by that point. It's like getting a child to say bad things.-Story is so who cares and you can tell, since it relies way more on plot conveniences than logic.-Music was trying way too hard to be LOL RANDOM.

8,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9953492/?ref_=tturv_perm_382,15 Years in the Making,"This one is the weakest in the Deadpool series but also has so much to enjoy. It's more like the swan song of the Fox X-Men series rather than an MCU entry.First the bad. It's pretty tame compared to the first two Deadpool movies. It may be because it's now under the official Disney-Marvel banner, or maybe it's because the Writers and Actors strikes during development. Whatever the reason, it seems like it's pulling its punches. It still has plenty of bite, but there's some obvious stuff the movie avoids going after.Already, some of the worst of the MCU is bleeding in. Mostly, that it relies too much on other works. Don't know the entire history of Marvel movies including undeveloped ones then the cameos don't feel special. Some of the stuff can go over the heads of casual fans. Didn't see Loki on Disney+? Then a lot of the second half won't make any sense. Deadpool has always used references to other Marvel work, but this is the first time it's necessary to the plot to know this stuff.Sadly, the supporting cast seems to have been tossed aside. There's the party scenes that bookend the movie, but they're entirely gone. None of the fun interactions with Colossus, Negasonic, Dopinder, etc that made the first two so much fun. There's a moment that seems like a set-up to a side story about them rescuing Wade, but nothing comes from it.The movie doesn't have the emotional core that the earlier two did. The first was a love story and the second about family. They had personal stakes. This one is about the destruction of the universe, which is big but lacks that personal touch. It also doesn't connect to the end of the second film as far as where the characters are. Too much of the in-between has to be explained when it would've been easier to just rewrite some scenes.There are two villains, but neither are interesting. Both seem to do whatever furthers the plot but not what makes sense. Neither have a plan that seems thought out, just to make the most problem at any given moment. The previous two had great conflicts, and this points to that lack of personal stakes.And finally, the Multiverse. Marvel and DC Comics have made great use of alternate realities, What Ifs, and possible futures. The movies not so much. I love seeing Patrick Stewart, Michael Keaton, and Tobey Maguire back in costume. But bringing back beloved actors, and occasionally listening to fan castings, seems to be the extent of what the movies are doing. The Deadpool Corps are also wasted. The idea of dozens of alternate Deadpools coming together should be cinematic gold. Instead they're mostly treated as cannon fodder.Now the good. The titular duo are amazing together. Reynolds and Jackman know how to bounce off each other. Both are in perfect form, showing the kind of rapport that's straight out of the comics. This is a team up that's been fifteen years in the making, and it doesn't disappoint in that regard. Though it's definitely more Wolverine's movie. It acknowledges how terrific Logan is, but gives this new Wolverine plenty of depth in what might be the best example of having its cake and eating it too.The movie does for the X-Men movies what No Way Home did for Spider-Man. It expertly includes the previous movie into the MCU while making a great case for their continuation. The X-Men and Spider-Man movies are the reason the MCU even exists so it's nice to see them treated so lovingly.Just like the original Deadpool did, the movie expertly brings the R rating to the MCU. In fact, there's more blood, swearing, and carnage than the other Deadpool movies. The only thing I know they couldn't do is hardcore drug use, and this makes for some fun scenes with Blind Al. This may be under the family friendly Disney banner, but Marvel seems to realize it's best for some franchises do their own thing.Deadpool has always had fun with Easter eggs, cameos, and references. This one more than most. The fight at the 20th Century Fox logo being a big one. It brings back a lot of characters from the franchise, and some from others like the Russian guy from the Thomas Jane Punisher movie. It may be more in-your-face than the previous two, but it's a lot of fun for the hardcore fans.This one feels like Avengers: Endgame. Too many problems to really match up to the previous entries, but too much good stuff to be bad. The MCU has been in a rough spot, but if anything this movie proves that Marvel can acknowledge that and work to fix it. Hopefully this won't be the last we see of Deadpool and Wolverine.",Helpful,•,2,0,ARTaylor,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur8588208/?ref_=tturv_usr_382_t,14-Aug-24,

The violence, profanity and scatological humor is as you'd expect, off the scale, and there is something of a convoluted plot going on, but really the main drive of the film felt like two characters who hate one another and spend a good portion of the film trying to kill one another. But the problem is, knowing that both protagonists are essentially immortal (one with endless regenerative abilities, the other with an unbreakable adamantium skeleton and a fast-healing factor) then their fights become essentially meaningless. They can't kill one another, so it's just basically watching two guys fight with one another and waiting for it to resolve so we can get on with the story. Maybe it was a little interesting with the initial fight but after awhile, it gets old. Likewise the many numerous cameos that I won't spoil here were amusing at first, but you can only do so many ""oh it's him"" or ""oh its her"" reactions and then it gets tedious, especially when you're teased with a cameo and then the character either dies shortly after or just isn't seen again. It's nostalgia key-dangling at it's worst. As mentioned, I am a fan of Hugh Jackman and his return to the Wolverine was fantastic, like he stepped right back into the same role he was so legendary at before, but unfortunately there's just not enough of him and, to be completely honest, I would have preferred to see him in his own film instead of in a tiresome, gory buddy comedy.",Helpful,•,30,44,OldMovieRob,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur98770882/?ref_=tturv_usr_383_t,25-Jul-24,

7,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw10057932/?ref_=tturv_perm_385,"Somethings work really well, others feel forced","Deadpool and Wolverine"" attempts to fuse the beloved irreverence of the Deadpool franchise with the rich emotional depth of the Wolverine character. While the film ultimately succeeds in many areas, it falters where humor should reign supreme. I found myself laughing far less than I expected. The humor, while crucial to the essence of the franchise, often felt forced, as if the writers were trying too hard to get the audience to laugh. I also felt the same way with the previous tow instalments.However, this is where Hugh Jackman shines as Wolverine. He brings a gravitas to the role that perfectly complements the chaos that surrounds him. Jackman plays it straight throughout, grounding the film and providing a powerful character arc that resonates deeply. Returning to the role after ""Logan,"" I was eager to see how he'd be integrated into the zany world of Deadpool, and I was pleasantly surprised by how well it all came together. His journey adds a layer of depth that balances Deadpool's antics, making their dynamic genuinely enjoyable.The movie leans heavily on cameos, a choice that could easily backfire, as seen in other recent comedies. Thankfully, ""Deadpool and Wolverine"" avoids this pitfall, ensuring that each cameo serves a purpose and contributes to the narrative rather than distracts from it. Each character's short appearances come with their own little arcs, enhancing rather than detracting from the overall story.On the action front, the film excels. Each set piece is meticulously crafted, with choreography that ramps up from one impressive sequence to the next. The final moments, underscored by a Madonna soundtrack, serve as a fitting and stylish conclusion that encapsulates the film's playful tone while delivering a satisfying payoff.Despite my appreciation for Jackman and the film's structural strengths, Ryan Reynolds' performance left me wanting. While I recognize he is irreplaceable in his role as Deadpool, it felt as though the humor sometimes fell flat, giving more of a sense of a comedian trying to be funny rather than effortlessly eliciting laughter. His delivery occasionally felt forced.In terms of plot, ""Deadpool and Wolverine"" does a decent job weaving a narrative that calls back to previous films while also paving the way for exciting new directions, primarily revolving around Deadpool's quest to convince Wolverine to step up and save the multiverse. The stakes feel significant, which adds weight to an otherwise outrageous film.In conclusion, while ""Deadpool and Wolverine"" may not deliver the riotous laughter I expected, it provides a thoughtfully crafted experience enriched by Jackman's performance and an impressive escalation of action. The film might not reach the comedic heights of the source material, but it still earns its place in the ever-expanding universe of these beloved characters.",Helpful,•,2,0,Junebug23057,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur23795151/?ref_=tturv_usr_385_t,9-Oct-24,

This was also satisfying because you didn't have to watch a bunch of other projects just to understand who the characters are, and understand their motivations. Especially since this is the 3rd Deadpool movie, featuring Wolverine, who has had a lot more cinematic backstory. While it can definitely be used as a good jumping off point, it wasn't just a small piece of a bigger story. I feel like that aspect has been missing from most of the post Endgame MCU projects, with a couple of exceptions. I hope this is the type of quality they focus on going forward, not just a one-off, since it featured Wolverine. With a comic accurate portrayal, in a team-up movie that people have been wanting for a while. It feels like this was made possible because they finally listened to what the audience has been wanting. I hope that continues. It seems like they put a lot of effort into making this work, but the MCU has done that before, and unfortunately, returned to the same broken formula. I imagine that the movie will be successful.

The first was a genius masterpiece. Witty, funny, likable characters, and you could see the effort all over the film for the full running time.The second film breaks the fourth wall yet more. Ryan Reynolds keeps talking about being the underdog, playing the likable guy who has an ongoing beef with Wolverine and Hugh Jackman occasionally, okay, that's funny. But there was too much effort into trying to make Deadpool into a billion dollar franchise with numerous spin-offs, etc etc. As a result, while the film had its moments, it definitely suffered with its focus on how to maximize the money and the depth the storyline.Come the third film and there is no fourth wall anymore. It's not an occasional fun moment. Wolverine isn't even Wolverine.

On the one hand, I think the movie is exactly what most people want from it - Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman hanging out, making jokes, and having a good time in the MCU. If that's all you're looking for, this movie absolutely delivers and it's well worth the price of admission. On the other hand... it's easily the worst of the three Deadpool movies.Deadpool is ostensibly doing everything he's doing in this movie in order to save his loved ones - all of the aforementioned supporting players from earlier Deadpool movies - characters like Yukio, Negasonic Teenage Warhead, Colossus, Vanessa, Blind Al, Dopinder, etc etc. However, only one of these supporting characters from the previous two Deadpool movies gets more than 2 minutes screen time, many of the rest don't even get lines. Instead, this movie replaces those supporting players for cameos from various failed Marvel projects - often for nothing more than a single joke or lazy nostalgic references. The idea is that these characters will finally be given the opportunity to have the send off / swan song they were previously denied in their own movies - but... none of them really get to enjoy that. They're just used in a fight montage that basically doesn't matter at all in the grand scheme of things.I can't help but feel like this would have been a much better movie had it traded the mostly ridiculous cameos in favor of involving the supporting Deadpool characters we've all come to love over the past two movies.I enjoyed the jokes for the most part, and it's good to see Disney embrace the rated R label for something like this - but the movie ultimately kind of fell flat as a whole.",Helpful,•,4,3,simianfriday,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur126645799/?ref_=tturv_usr_391_t,27-Jul-24,

Lot of inside jokes (they prank eachother loads of time in rl), but also lots and lots and lots of franchise jokes. And that is what I think is an reoccuring MCU issue: you are expected to have seen about every previous MCU movie, other Marvel movie and tv show and read all the comic. Sure I exaggerate a bit now, but lot of cameo's date even before MCU, but also were referring to comics. Some of the storyline can be confusing for people who missed the Loki series (like my wife).

8,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9951033/?ref_=tturv_perm_398,Let's ******* Go!!,"Directed & Co-Written by Shawn Levy, the movie follows Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) seeks to lead a quiet life away from his past as Deadpool. However, everything takes an unexpected turn when the TVA takes him to help them save the timeline. He then recruits the Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), the only person he hopes that could help.It seems evident that the introduction of X-Men/Mutants into the MCU was planned in the context of the multiverse concept for the next saga. Even though I like the idea, I can't help but think that Marvel's decision to bring back a character with a definitive ending might be seen as a desperate move. However, given that the multiverse and variants will be central themes for phase four to six, I have no doubt that they will manage to make it work somehow. Considering the mixed reception of the current and last phases, I was afraid they would botch this up again. Thankfully, I was wrong.Deadpool & Wolverine is far from perfect, but it does provide a theater experience that people have missed since Spider-Man: No Way Home. However, if you start to think deeply about where the movie fit in the Fox timeline after the events in Days of Future Past and some pretty significant plot holes (I hope you don't), the movie starts to fall apart. I don't think those would be a big problem though. I see it as merely a continuation problem in the script because this movie is supposed to be a standalone one. Besides, it's actually a great redemption arc story for the characters. Deadpool finally gets to be the hero he always wanted to be, while Wolverine, who has let his entire kind down, has the opportunity to save countless others.After watching all the previous X-Men movies, it's finally safe to say that Hugh Jackman delivered the best performance as the beloved character he portrayed for 24 years. That one scene really stood out, and it was great to finally see him in the iconic suit. Ryan Reynolds did a great job as the Merc with a Mouth, but I feel like he wasn't quite at the same level as in Deadpool 2.All in all, Deadpool & Wolverine is like a prayer that people have been praying for years, and when it's finally here, it just feels like home.",Helpful,•,5,3,theffachrif,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur147219942/?ref_=tturv_usr_398_t,12-Aug-24,

Together, with the help of both new and familiar faces, they must defeat a dangerous new foe and save his world before it's torn apart. Overall, due to the fall-out-of-your-chair laughs, Reynold's and Jackman's electric chemistry, badass action, and brilliant meta commentary, I loved this feature, and even though I had a few gripes with it and it's lack of connection to the MCU, this movie was nearly perfect and some of the most fun I've had in the theater, and a great final send off for the Fox universe while also being a highlight for Marvel in its darkest hour.",Helpful,•,0,0,Dylpickle08,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur186313053/?ref_=tturv_usr_399_t,12-Aug-24,

This one is solidly in the latter category. If you like Ryan Reynolds' humor style, especially that of the prior Deadpool films, it's almost a lock that you'll laugh at and enjoy this as well because, well, it's more of the same.The action is also quite good. Some of the sequences can overstay their welcome at times, but they're always at least initially visually interesting. They just needed to be about 20% shorter, I think.There's a strong visual spectacle to the whole thing that is also quite good...probably better than the previous Deadpools.The acting was decent. I think Jackman in particular gets to go places I'm glad he went with this character. The moments are brief, but they're good. Reynolds...not so much. Cassandra Nova's actress did quite well I thought. Chris Evans is delightful in his cameo. But most of the rest were highly forgettable.But let's talk about the bad. The Plot. There isn't one. Okay, that's not entirely fair. There is a plot. It's just TERRIBLE. It's little more than a light justification for stringing together random cameo sequences and Reynolds' comedy bits. The movie feels almost like a sketch comedy show but with two recurring characters in each sketch, like a Python movie.Both villains' entire plans are undone by the fact that both of them are extremely stupid for no reason...multiple times. Each time Logan and Wade get the better of them, you WILL see it coming in the same way that a train blasting it's horn at you is hard to miss.Logan's character arc makes good sense, and resonates, but Reynolds' kind of doesn't. It is invented for this movie. To some extent that might be inevitable in the third installment of a trilogy.And while the fan service/homages/references/cameos are often done well and in a comforting way (the movie would have been insufferable had they been done poorly), they are nonetheless empty calories.And of course, plot holes. There are so many plot points that feel arbitrary and nonsensical. Characters doing things for the purpose of advancing the plot. Technologies or magic system points that come out of nowhere to justify things. I don't think it's a spoiler to name the most egregious one: The 'Anchor Being' concept is so profoundly idiotic and inconsistent that I actively encourage you not to think about it lest you lose 5-7 IQ points from psychic damage. As I did. And believe me, it's FAR from the only one.But at the end of the day, the question is: Did I have a good time? I did. As stupid as this movie was, Reynolds is funny and charming.

5,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9949412/?ref_=tturv_perm_403,A Disappointing Descent into Mediocrity,"I must confess a fondness for the first two Deadpool instalments. They were, undeniably, a breath of fresh air in the superhero genre. However, this latest offering is a perplexing departure from the formula.The crux of the issue lies in Deadpool himself. The character, once a complex anti-hero grappling with mortality and loss, has been reduced to a grating caricature. His incessant chatter, while previously endearing, now feels like a relentless assault on the senses. The Wolverine character, too, is a shadow of his former self. His transformation from brooding anti-hero to reluctant sidekick is jarring and unexplained.The plot is a haphazard concoction of tired tropes and forced humour. The villain, Cassandra, is a one-dimensional antagonist whose motivations are as clear as mud. The constant barrage of self-referential jokes and product placements feels more like a desperate attempt to fill screen time than genuine wit. The multiverse concept, once a promising avenue for exploration, is squandered on predictable twists and turns.The film's saving graces are few and far between. The cameos are enjoyable, and the canine companion offers a welcome moment of respite. Yet, these are mere distractions from the film's fundamental flaws. The action sequences, typically a Marvel strong point, are lacklustre and repetitive. The overall tone is jarringly inconsistent, veering wildly between juvenile humour and attempted seriousness.In conclusion, ""Deadpool & Wolverine"" is a disappointing misfire. It squanders the potential of its beloved characters, offering little in the way of compelling narrative or character development. The film's reliance on cheap laughs and forced cameos is a disservice to the franchise. It's a film that promises much but delivers little, leaving one to wonder what might have been.",Helpful,•,5,7,him090296,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur122315513/?ref_=tturv_usr_403_t,11-Aug-24,

You're joining at a low point"" tells the merc with a mouth to a brooding, self-loathing and hurting Wolverine. This line, along with the many fourth wall breaks that the titular anti-hero Deadpool performs now and then serve as a reminder about what this whole thing's business is: setting the record straight. It's a brash ad campaign for the fact that Disney is not afraid of the R-rating and that its questionable decisions in the past regarding the MCU were just one of many directions they can go. Make no mistake, this is Disney showing off but the reason why none of us are bothered by it is because this movie is helmed by flamboyant, relatable and wicked Ryan Reynolds (and I really do mean ""helmed"", as he is also part of the three co-writers).So then begins a dare: how many Joker-esque puns involving gore, drug abuse and masturbation (sometimes all at once) can one anti-hero cramp into a two hour running time before Disney gets its point across and the whole thing becomes an endurance test? Well, apparently a bit too many because by the end, the movie's sequential rapid-fire anecdotes do start to get tiring. Even Reynolds admits this, as there is a moment close to the ending of the movie where Deadpool looks at the camera and tells the audience to hang in there, as we are on the home stretch. I admit, having such a loveable hunk like Reynolds asking us to bear with him did make me cut him some slack.But while ""Deadpool & Wolverine"" might not be the best of movies, it's definitely worthy of belonging to the upper echelon of Marvel movies when it comes to entertainment. Its moments of fun are just cramming to get on the screen, most of them hitting the comedic timing perfectly: pop culture references, socio-political parodies and snappy one-liners that take you by surprise--I nearly choked on soda at one point). But they have to be like that, because there is not much depth to them. It's like doomscrolling through a webpage of memes whose lasting power is as brief as they appear on the screen, except that the memes are done professionally. It's all part of the dare.But this is not what all this movie is. There are moments when even the most depraved of anti-heroes must stop and take a look around. When the mask is off and Deadpool becomes Wade Wilson, he struggles with relatable personal pain like insignificance and meaning--""I don't know how to be a hero"", he says at one point. This movie's plot, beneath all the distractions, is more or less him finding out how. And also not to mention Hugh Jackman's Wolverine, whose performance seems to only get better with age. He is a defeated and lost soul tormented by a great pain involving past failures. Together, Deadpool & Wolverine become the buddy-comedy duo of the MCU.After watching this movie, a lot of people might feel hope for the future of the MCU. Self-proclaimed internet pundits might even punch themselves in the chest, claiming Disney finally saw the errors of its ways and returned to form. But we cannot be sure that this is just not another phase--after all, of course a movie involving Deadpool would put the ESRB to work. Plus, regardless of anything, there is only so many ideas and so much energy a franchise has, even something as big as the MCU. I'm not saying the good days are behind us, I'm just saying that no promises have been made. Still, I will definitely smirk when I will inevitably see this quirky poster on Disney's streaming service next to the likes of ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarves"" or ""The Sound of Music"".",Helpful,•,1,3,danielgroza,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur64605741/?ref_=tturv_usr_405_t,31-Jul-24,

Perhaps it works in that light; I do not know.What I do know is, by normal storytelling measures, this film has absolutely nothing to offer. Every plot-development here is so arbitrary that the overall story makes no difference at all. There are no stakes, and nothing like character-development.

Case in point cable and juggernaut! I still can't speak enough of how epic those two films were. But this Wolverine and Deadpool movie, even with all the pizazz, could not quite measure up to those movies. I think the reason it couldn't was due to the far fetched script. It was just too out there.But seeing Wolverine and Deadpool together on the screen was great. However, I need more than a team up to make a movie a success.Lastly, why does Ryan have to make so many jokes about men? Are the comics like that? Anyways, great comedic movie.

And this film certainly delivers from what the trailers promised.The plot makes very little sense and is once again another attempt to explain the multiverse that contradicts what came before it. Logical cause and effect are thrown to the wind in favour of moving from spectacle to spectacle. But this can be forgiven since this is a Deadpool film and thus, logic is basically forgotten. That being said, I would've liked more consistency in the plot and certain beats don't hit as hard as the film probably wants it to.But this film certainly delivers on the buddy adventure of Deadpool and Wolverine. Hugh Jackman and Ryan Reynolds prove they are still perfect for these roles. Especially Jackman, playing a different Wolverine and making him distinct from his original self. The two have excellent chemistry on screen and they are involved in the film's funniest moments. There is also an irreverent amount of fan service and at times it certainly feels overdone and bothersome. But there are a lot of surprises that will leave audiences floored. The action is solid and the dialogue and humour is what you would expect from a Deadpool film. Some jokes really hit, others miss.Another issue however is this film feels stuffed. So many characters and moments feel underdeveloped. I would've loved for more time with some of these characters, especially on the villain front. It would have served to heighten the emotional and hysterical impact.Overall though, while it is my least favourite Deadpool film, this film is loads of fun.

The adult innuendo references were hilarious especially if you expect to hear it and see it. Ryan REYNOLDS was perfect as Deadpool. Sarcastic, smart ass, perverted and flat out doesn't give a darn about what he says or does. Cause he's so warped. He says everything that we're thinking but don't have the courage to say. Especially his talking to the audience. Loved his character. Wolverine/Logan was extremely excellent. I loved his angry, drunken and aggressive personality, like he didn't want to be bothered so his anger would get the best of him.I love the marvel comic series and the picture series. BUT I will admit once the whole multiverse storyline gets into play that's when it gets confusing. Blending in all these wolverines and all these avenger characters into the X-men universe wasn't necessary. They shouldn't really blend in the two universes. Just like when they blended Alien and Predator. Now if they made a spin off movie, completely having nothing to do with the original story lines or not even effecting the storyline. If they did that, I would make a X-men vs Avengers movie, at least a 2hrs and 45 min movie. Then have them team up and face the main bad guy. That'll be worth it. But we do love the joke references to the marvel universe and to the movie industry. Also the avenger references were hilarious. Deadpool can really get under your skin. Lol.

And then, lightbulb, we realized: there is no point to watching two perfectly matched, immortal beings fight.There are no stakes. We all know no one is going to die or suffer any consequences for longer than five seconds. So every fight scene was basically the equivalent of watching two toddlers squabble. But with even the threat of a time out removed. It got tiresome immediately, yet continued the entire film. The thing could have been about thirty minutes long if they pulled the gratuitous, but pointless, fight scenes out.The multiverse stuff has further removed the stakes, since if anything bad happens, they can just rewrite it and start over in a new film.This movie is yet another fan-service circle jerk. The entire film is set up to feed the audience a string of obscure, niche character and forgotten fandom cameos, with the weakest of plots holding it together like used chewing gum to justify it. They pulled from Marvel, they pulled from XMen, then it got weird and they started pulling from other fandoms, like Mad Max and Blade. I'm honestly shocked Star Wars didn't end up in there, somewhere, but maybe that would have blown the budget and the nerd audience's heads.Having grown up casually watching the XMen cartoon after school everyday in the 90's, I admittedly recognized about 80% of the cameod characters, and had a brief flare of ""oh, it's that one guy!

Without spoiling the movie, even though it's only a little over 2 hours, it was long and drawn out, and suffered the same problems that most of the recent MCU movies had (using the multiverse storyline for lazy writing, random fan service, and low quality rushed production). Even the Logan director said the same thing. The pointless intro itself unnecessarily took a lot of time. Again without spoiling, as expected there are a number of familiar faces, and it was actually very exciting to see those familiar faces, but it's really disappointing what they did with them. They could have done so much more with them, and they could have used a lot of the random/drawn-out time to do that. I'm not sure why there are so many raving reviews here to be honest? I was actually shocked the theatre was basically half empty right after release. Normally Marvel movies are packed and difficult to get a seat for a while. It also seemed most of the audience didn't enjoy it either except for maybe 2 or 3 people who giggled at everything. I do really hope they eventually end this multiverse storyline, especially now that they have Deadpool and X-Men under the Disney-Marvel umbrella, and start focusing on the core story with the dedicated cast.

I loved all the jokes they made about the MCU and all the callbacks to the movies made before it. Sadly, Deadpool 3 doesn't bring much to the table itself.

I'm very impressed by the balance between the funny vibe and the more serious emotional scenes, Hugh Jackman shows incredible acting in this movie.The only thing that could've been done better was Dafne Keen who felt a bit underused and some of her traits (like yelling in Spanish) wasn't shown enough.

Their chemistry is amazing no matter what situation they're in.People initially skeptical of Disney watering down the mature rating of Deadpool have nothing to worry about as the humor and violence are arguably at their best here. The constant roasting of the mismanagement of the MCU and X-Men never gets old along with the rest of the Deadpool humor. The absurd amount of cameos and references also rewards longtime fans; More casual moviegoers will feel less of an impact by these moments or even be confused at times.For me, the weakest parts of the movie are the middle-of-the-road villains and the relationship between Wade Wilson and Vanessa. Both were just there and didn't seem fully fleshed out along with the setting of a good portion of the movie that I won't spoil here. As far as the structure of the story goes there wasn't much to it for better or for worse. On one hand, we get a lot of Deadpool and Wolverine hijinx but on the other hand, I was hoping for more hints about the future of the characters and MCU due to the inclusion of the multiverse, TVA, and Disney's acquisition of 20th Century Studios.Deadpool and Wolverine however is an insanely wild ride that's created by filmmakers who are passionate about the characters for fans of the Marvel Universe.

And boy did it live up to all the hype (almost). I'll try my best to keep this review spoiler-free.From starting to finish this movie was an unforgettable theatrical experience. The entire theatre was laughing and cheering for the return of these beloved characters. The soundtrack freaking slaps. The action is well choreographed, bloody and gruesome, the comedy lands perfectly and the emotional moments hit hard. Hugh Jackman as Wolverine and Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool were fantastic and their chemistry was off the charts. There were some cameos that were utilised pretty well in the movie. Plus the movie is loaded with Easter eggs that MCU Stans will gobble up. The pacing is done well that the 2 hrs runtime flies by. Shawn Levy directed the hell outta this movie. I just loved the idea of them poking fun at the MCU and the movie industry in general.However I did feel that the story was a bit too confusing at times and the villain was underwhelming to say the least. So if you're going in expecting a great storyline then you might be disappointed. But those are my only criticisms. This is MCU's biggest movie of the decade after No Way Home and is destined to become this year's biggest blockbuster.Overall Deadpool and Wolverine is bloody, funny and emotional. It expertly balances it's bloody action and crude humour with such emotional moments. The two leads have impeccable chemistry and the movie celebrates the superhero genre while also poking fun at it. Even though the movie falters when it comes to telling a cohesive story, it still largely delivers everything Marvel fans have been wanting for and is destined to become a box office juggernaut.

There is a problem with all these multiverse movies. The lack of effort in storytelling is evident in all of these movies. The phrase ""all style, no substance"" shows a lot in the multiverse movies, and it shows a lot of it here, although I wouldn't go as far as saying there is an absolute zero substance here, but you get the point.The movie is what you would expect: a high-octane action-packed movie filled with lewd jokes and jokes directed at Disney, Fox, and the MCU. Sometimes, it gets exhausting to repeatedly have a joke every minute or so, but the ones that do land are really funny. I have to admit, this movie got me cracking at times. However, for a movie that was expected to save the MCU, it didn't reach that high bar. I still hope this movie inspires the MCU to give what the people want or what most want anyway. This way, the next movie has a higher chance of being a movie that fans will love.Despite having no real plot, I liked the character arcs of Logan and Wade. For Deadpool, he learns what it means to be a hero. For Wolverine, we see a new arc since this guy's a new guy. The character arc is good, as he also learns what it means to be a hero. However, I felt that this arc had already been done before for Logan, so I felt it was kind of repetitive. Outside of the two leads, however, the other characters have little to do. The two mains really carried the movie for me. Hugh wearing the comic costume was also nice.For a movie that was meant to be the last ""Fox"" movie, I was kind of disappointed with how it dealt with the Fox movies. I know the movies are things of the past, but I felt that more respect could have been given. Again, there are some things I can only talk about in the next review, but all I will say is that I felt a bit unsatisfied. One thing that I really loved was the credits scene (not to be confused with the post-credits scene). That tugged at my heart.One thing that I absolutely hate about this movie is that most of the cameos (maybe except X-23) weren't utilized more. They were just kind of there, like in Multiverse of Madness (or Sadness as I would say). People like Sabretooth, Pyro, and the rest (who I can't talk about yet) should have had more to do. For X-23, I guess she had the talk with Jackman's alternate Wolverine, which I think is what made me say it wasn't wasted. There were several missed opportunities, which I will mention in the next review.The performances were all really good, though. I think Hugh Jackman plays Wolverine so effortlessly. After 7 years of retirement, he comes back, and it feels like he never left, and I am not saying this just because I love Wolverine. Hugh's and Ryan's interactions were really fun. Macfadyen and Corrin's performances were also good in their villain roles, despite the lack of depth each has.The visuals are alright. They're better than past post-Endgame movies. I think the scenes in the Void could have looked better because they kind of look dry sometimes. I know that's the point because Deadpool references Mad Max, but I just think maybe it could have been less plain. The soundtrack, however, was awesome. I think that every time the music plays, the scene gets instantly better. They match what the scene needs.Overall, if you're looking for a movie that moves you or has a decent story, look elsewhere. However, if you are looking for a movie that has good action and lewd jokes that crack you up from time to time, this is your movie.P. S.

I stayed and watched something I would rather classify in the tv comercial (comedy/sketch) department. Then in the major movie theaters. Deadpool 1 and 2 at least we're easy to watch hillarious full of good action /fight scenes . The CGI was good and not overdone . And the acting was good.But this final version of Deadpool and wolverine, is just a chaotic bunch of mixed together edited together comedy sketches, that belong in tv commercials or one the comedy central .But not on the big screen. There is like no storyline whatsoever in it yeah sure the description says otherwise 🤔.But what's supposed to be the story all I seen in the movie, was him looking for a wolverine, and killing everyone on his path . And 90%of that was cgi animated bull..t. The only posetive was the little snippets with blade in it, but those also looked more like something that was part of a comedy skit, rather then part of a movie .So overall review .Acting was bad because the movie was mostly cgi.

An overpowered villain(bald Jean Grey) who kept the protagonists alive although she obliterated everyone but just tossed the two around halfheartedly. When she was fighting with Deadpool and Wolverine the protection of the plot was thicker than Kevin Feige's head who is the responsible for both rise and now demise of the franchise. This kind of villain behaviour did not make sense with Wanda in Doctor Strange 2 and it certainly did not make sense here.Speaking of Doctor Strange, if one can portal between universes with a sling-ring then why the hell Wanda was trying to steal America's powers? I guess this was another dumb writing that we witnessed.Jokes were fine-ish. I loved 55% of them. Rest of them were cringy and not funny at all. And that's all just there. Laughs and Cameos. That's also presenting the fact that the writer only knows how to write comedy films. Not human-centric storytelling with complex character study. The characters who actually working towards personal goals. Yes, it was personal for Deadpool up until the end. Then Marvel had to push their infamous ""big cgi fight button"" and everything suddenly was about cringy overused ""the end of the world"" stuff, thus, the film got worsened.Dear, god, Marvel really still baiting on fan-favourite cameos.

From the get-go, the movie captures the chaotic energy that fans of both characters crave. Deadpool's trademark humor is as sharp as ever, cutting through the action with a relentless barrage of fourth-wall-breaking quips and meta-commentary that feels both fresh and familiar. Meanwhile, Wolverine brings the grizzled intensity that perfectly balances Deadpool's manic antics.The chemistry between Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman is undeniable, driving the movie with a dynamic that feels like a violent buddy comedy-if the buddies had a tendency to eviscerate their enemies in creatively gory ways. The plot, while not groundbreaking, serves as a solid backbone for the characters to do what they do best: unleash carnage, bicker, and begrudgingly save the day.Visually, the film is stunning, with action sequences that are as brutal as they are stylish. The direction embraces the R-rated potential, ensuring that neither character is diluted for a younger audience. This is a film made for fans, and it knows exactly what they want.Where ""Deadpool & Wolverine"" really shines is in its willingness to take risks. It pushes boundaries-not just with its humor and violence, but with its narrative choices that cleverly subvert typical superhero tropes. However, it's not without its flaws. The pacing occasionally stumbles, and a few jokes feel more forced than fluid. But these are minor quibbles in an otherwise exhilarating experience.In the end, ""Deadpool & Wolverine"" delivers a bloody, hilarious, and surprisingly heartfelt romp that proves that sometimes, all you need is a foul-mouthed antihero and a cigar-chomping mutant to breathe new life into the superhero genre.

And if you buy into that (like I did) then you will have a fantastic time. If you don't (or if you hate Deadpool as a character) then you probably won't enjoy it as much.Aside from that though, the thing that I enjoyed most about the movie is that Deadpool feels much more like he should. I love Deadpool 1 and 2, but he always kind of felt like he stuck out in those worlds. Yeah it's the same universe as X-Men, but it felt like they wouldn't let him get TOO comic booky (and in the second movie he basically doesn't fourth wall break at all, it's just snark and pop culture references). But here though, they let it all fly, and it works brilliantly.There's fourth wall breaking, ridiculous (in a good way) fight scenes, and just general over-the-top shenanigans for the entire runtime. There's still lots of meta humor, lots of shots at Disney and Fox, but I enjoyed it. I had so much fun with this movie and haven't laughed that much in a long time.As for issues (aside from the fan service), it does feel like Deadpool gets a little sidelined at times. The movie tries to balance both him and Wolverine, and sometimes it's a little weighted in Wolverine's favor. The emotional stakes are also fairly shallow. Yeah it has them and tries to justify them (and Wolverine actually gets some good development), but it's nothing you haven't seen before and isn't going to blow you away.So if you go into this expecting Logan, you're going to be severely disappointed.

Characters have little to no motivation and just do stuff for, well... doing stuff. The arcs are not fleshed out, and the exposition is being spoon-fed to the point of regurgitation. The script repeatedly favors cheap thrills rather than telling a coherent story. The funny thing is the film is self-aware about all this to an extreme point where it starts butchering its own narrative.With that being said, the film still manages to redeem itself to some extent as everything else is S-tier. It has some of the craziest and goriest action sequences and stunt choreography in the MCU. Pretty much all of the jokes landed. The VFX department outdid themselves. The cameos are absolutely insane; two of them produced the loudest ear-raping war cries I have ever heard in a theater.Ryan and Hugh are so good in their roles that even with the lackluster script, it is virtually impossible not to have the time of your life watching this.

Is a 2024 dark comedy action film with Ryan Reynolds not only returning as Deadpool but the Hugh himself returns as Wolverine after 7 years, but this time he's wearing his classic suit and seen as a letdown in an alternative universe as he failed to save his X-Men team.As their misadventures continue throughout it's over 2 hour runtime the enjoyment and pure fun this film produces is awesome, along with insane cameos and breathtaking visuals this entry in the Deadpool franchise is most certainly different from it's predecessors.What makes it give it the huge difference in comparison is the very powerful chemistry between the 2 leads. Deadpool is what he always has been and has not been altered in any way but Wolverine kind of bounces Deadpool back with some colourful language too and it's like sometimes, their arguments are like a long tennis fight, and I think it was absolutely hilarious.While it's hard to talk about the film without going into spoiler territory, trust me DO NOT GET THIS FILM SPOILED. There's really surprising character comebacks and it's crazy to actually witness on the big screen where you should definitely watch it.Overall Deadpool And Wolverine has the same qualities as the original 2, but with it's horrific but funny gore and explicit jokes comes with more heart and enjoyment with battles and quotable dialogue that really could change the tide of the MCU, this film really is the best of the year so far and makes a mark on Deadpool and the MCU as one of the most fun films I have ever seen, Well done guys!Grade: A+25th July 2024 Showcase Cinema Deluxe Southampton.",Helpful,•,7,4,johnalagoz,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur170534623/?ref_=tturv_usr_474_t,26-Jul-24,

As someone who reads the actual comics too,this one is sure a treat. I did not like the first 30 minutes of it though. I thought it was very cringe the first half,that is until Wolverine(Hugh jackman) shows up midway through it,and somehow the film starts to pick itself up from there. This is everything I love about Wolverine and they finally get his character right,even down to the classic yellow costume which I thought the first X-Men film was lacking. I could watch a swearing,heavy drinking Wolvie all night lol Gawd is he so damn fine(hot) in this too. Wow what a perfect body! Hugh is also like the Clint Eastwood of this generation,which is perfect because I always felt a young Clint can pulloff the Logan character. Deadpool on the other hand I didn't care much for. Then again I never liked him much in the comics either. Maybe the only things that bug me are the levels of gore which is too much for my taste(this has to be the most violent superhero movie so far! Thus I wouldn't eat while watching this one.) ,and it seems like it kinda rips off(or makes fun of?) The Flash movie from last year. The showdown with Cassandra Nova was oddly similar to the showdown with General Zod in the Flash. Right down to the mindblowing superhero cameos. The use of alternate timelines also felt similar to the Flash. The thing that really makes this movie is Wolverine(Hugh Jackman) imo. If he wasn't in it,it would really suck...Reason why I avoided the Dark Phoenix film is because Wolverine is not in it. Hugh even throws in a little dramatic acting in this amidst the zany comedy. This maybe the Superman III of X-men movies,but then again Wolverine is quite funny in the comics and does drink alot and say ""Bub"" too..The only thing missing was a cigar but other than that I think I enjoyed this. Alot of things in this movie also that only people who read the comics will understand. Such as the reference to the Uncanny X-men #251 cover art. I might watch it again just for certain scenes.

I am being quite serious in this assessment, even giving myself a few weeks after the first time I saw it (during my stay in New York City) before posting this sort of praise publicly about a movie that was just supposed to be silly fun.Why is it so great? I think it just scratches a lot of different itches. The initial viewing had me coming away thinking there was a crap story at the core of the movie but everything else was so good to more than make up for that weakness. From the second time on, though, I caught and appreciated more of the plot, even to the point of getting emotional in the final action sequence (and it wasn't just because Madonna was playing in the background). Love, as is always the case in Deadpool movies, lies at the center of all the adolescent jokes and fourth-wall breaking.Even this latest time at the theater, the folks seated to my right were having a grand ol' time, laughing at all the funny parts and ""oohing"" at all the... ooohy parts, and it's been a couple of months since the movie premiered. I think it's just that Ryan Reynolds goes ""hey wouldn't it be great if we did that"" and Kevin Feige has been ""yes, go for it"" around 95% of the time. Who knew that artists can make great art when permitted, right?Hugh Jackman brings his top-shelf acting game (when does he not?) to the story, making tragedy and redemption a believable part of a very self-aware cinematic experience. It's about as good as I've ever seen at combining winks at the audience with complete emotional investment by them.I really appreciate what Reynolds has been able to do, both in bringing Deadpool into mainstream culture and with almost single-handedly resurrecting the MCU.

Deadpool & Wolverine is the 3rd film in the Deadpool trilogy this time featuring the team up and highly anticipated return of Hugh Jackman as Wolverine.It's no secret that the MCU has been suffering from fatigue and creativity lately. The hype around this film was that it was going to be the MCU saviour and a step back in the right direction. The film even jokes about this constantly. With expectations at an all time high can Deadpool pull of this endeavour?The short answer is yes...yes it sure can. Deadpool & Wolverine is pure and simply a summer superhero blockbuster. It knows what it is and just thrives on being a fun film. From the opening scene Deadpool sets the tone and lets the audiences know what they are in store for. Deadpool is consistently funny, has some amazingly done action set pieces, and perhaps better yet throws surprise after surprise at the audience. I went into this film blind as I've just kind of been done with the MCU lately...and let me tell you this is the best way to see the film. Avoid spoilers at all cost.Overall this is a true summer film. One that is meant to be enjoyed in theatres. The plot is serviceable although not groundbreaking or setting the path for future Marvel movies. It knows what audiences are looking for and what they have been asking for and it gives it to them...hard. This is definitely a step in the right direction and I hope Disney/Marvel can continue this momentum going forward.Positives:

And finally, the cameos - whilst some do miss the mark - most are good, some are brilliant. Subversive, honorary and/or just simple hilarious fan-service.

There's also too many plot conveniences to get the main characters to their next destination that it's grating.

This is especially more noticeable in a second viewing; which I did just to be sure I was on it the first time.

My initial thinking was that one of these after six years is fine and I think this is in some ways a welcome return to form. On the other hand, the idea of the multiverse, which has already been overplayed, is in force here. Not on the same level as, for example, the second Dr. Strange movie, but still it is here. They are smart enough to make fun of it, but even if you are satirizing and commenting on something by doing that very thing, you are still doing that very thing.Same with fan service. The movie is both doing it and making fun of it. They brought back so many characters from the past. This kind of meta-irony doesn't really work for me as it has become a cliche on to itself.

I do admit that there was one little-more-than-a-cameo that was actually done in a very cool way (and as far as I knew, they managed to keep it a secret this time).Sure, there is stuff in this movie that gets me, but I'm easy that way. I'll cry for anything with weepy enough soundtrack. But again, there's one of these things that really works for me within all the noise.Deadpool movies haven't really needed a good villain, but Cassandra Nova works pretty well and they do some cool things with her powers here. Also, I always enjoy it when the actor seems to relish the role and that's definitely the case here.In the end, there's a lot of things to like.

Here's my take on this rollercoaster of a movie:This film is a glorious, action-packed riot that embraces its absurdity with open arms. Hugh Jackman as Wolverine proves yet again that he's the best at what he does, even if what he does isn't very nice. The banter between Jackman and Ryan Reynolds is nothing short of comedic gold, with Reynolds' Deadpool delivering quips faster than Wolverine can pop his claws. The chemistry between these two is electric, and their dynamic is the heartbeat of the film.The plot? Well, it's as chaotic as you'd expect from a Deadpool movie, but that's part of the charm. The film doesn't take itself too seriously, and neither should you. It's a blend of action, humor, and heart that keeps you engaged from start to finish. The dialogue is peppered with enough f-bombs to make a sailor blush, but it's all in good fun. The cameos are plentiful and surprising, making every scene a potential ""oh snap"" moment.Emma Corrin as Cassandra Nova is a standout villain, bringing a cold-blooded yet sardonic edge to the film. She's a perfect foil for our two heroes, and her presence elevates the stakes. The action sequences are a banquet of madness, especially the ""corridor"" fight scene (which is actually in a street) - it's a visual and visceral treat.The soundtrack is another highlight, perfectly complementing the film's frenetic energy. The opening scene alone is pure gold, setting the tone for the chaos that follows. And let's not forget the post-credits scene - it's a must-see, packed with hints for future adventures.In summary, *Deadpool & Wolverine* is a bloody, hilarious romp that's sure to please fans of both characters. It's not Shakespeare, but it's a damn good time. So grab your popcorn, suspend your disbelief, and enjoy the ride. And remember, if Wolverine can keep going until he's 90, then there's plenty more fun to be had with these two.",Helpful,•,1,5,QAlpha007,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur57147046/?ref_=tturv_usr_487_t,6-Aug-24,

I'm certainly not alone in my love for X-Men, although, in all honesty, I haven't kept up enough to know all the details. And so, there were more than enough moments and references throughout which left me clawing my own brain (much like a certain character in the movie) looking for the right information to go with what I was seeing to explain the overwhelming mayhem that was going on. Unfortunately, for the most part, I was left feeling exactly like that: overwhelmed and pummelled by the nonsensical mayhem.Please understand: I freaking love Deadpool!! And I love Wolverine even more, I really do. You have no idea how high my anticipation was for this collaboration that's basically been 24 years in the making. 'Logan' (2017) was a truly beautiful piece of cinema, deeply moving and virtually flawless. It was a truly fitting ending to one of the best fictional characters in modern cinema. I remember going into 'Deadpool & Wolverine' extremely excited, and then, as the introductory scene started rolling out, suddenly I thought to myself, ""Oh God, I hope they don't ruin it."" I was overcome by a sudden sense of dread that somehow, Wolverine's resurrection in this movie would somehow completely demolish the feeling left behind by 'Logan'. And I hate to say it, but... I wasn't entirely wrong. Certainly, this is Deadpool and you know going in that absolutely *nothing* is sacred, but still... Was it worth it? Was it at least funny? The answer is yes... and no.The absolute worst thing has happened: I didn't love 'Deadpool & Wolverine'. I didn't hate it either. It left me feeling ambivalent. Who the hell wants to feel ambivalent about the greatest X-Men pairing of all time??The first act was great. It gave me great hopes for the second and third acts, and then, suddenly, that feeling vanished. The start of the second act is awesome, no doubt about it. D&W are hurled into what's essentially the garbage bin of the universe, and this is where all the fabled cameos start rolling in. And then, inexplicably, there's a shift in tone. The first familiar X-Men face to turn up made me super happy, and then it was over before you could even blink and I felt a devastating disappointment. I was so looking forward to this particular reunion/confrontation and it ended so abruptly that I felt robbed. I felt the shift happen with the rest of the audience as well, it was palpable. From this moment on, so much happens all at once and we're thrown into a setting that's so reminiscent of ""Deadpool and Wolverine beyond Thunderdome"", (including actual jokes about Mad Max) that somehow, it passes the point of parody and turns into on-the-nose cliché. It all feels too familiar, and at the same time, so strange and confusing, I was just constantly stuck in a feeling of ""what the hell is going on""?! Who are all these characters? What are they doing here? Why did Feige et al pull open such a random can of X-Men villains without giving any of them any worthy screen time? How are we even supposed to understand everything that's happening when all we are given to go on is an overload of references and puzzle pieces that we apparently have to put together ourselves? Do they expect every single audience member to possess an encyclopaedic knowledge of the entire MCU? Jason Flemyng and Kelly Hu are back as Azazel and Lady Deathstrike respectively and are given so little screentime and not even a single line of dialogue, it really makes you wonder if they prioritised quantity over quality this time. The answer to me is clearly, yes. It feels as if they spent 15 minutes working on the actual story for this film, and the rest of the time they had on gathering as many Marvel characters (and nearly all their original actors!) as possible to pummel the audience into their own kind of Void, where we might actually be fooled into thinking that an overkill of quantity actually equates quality.The rest of the audience clearly felt the same way I did. From the start of the second act, for at least about half an hour or so, it was awkwardly quiet in the theatre. Nobody laughed and all the jokes fell completely flat. It wasn't until the third act that things started looking up again. Maybe it has all become too familiar. The first Deadpool movie was incredible, because it was something that had never actually been done before, style wise. The tone was so original and refreshing, and the ironic nature of the humour was such an original concept that it all worked surprisingly well. Then they did it a second time and even though it was a little less brilliant, it was still great. This time, it's just... yeah I've seen this before. Oh ha-ha, ironic joke. A dozen ironic songs. Breaking the fourth wall so much it's been destroyed completely. Subtlety was never Deadpool's strong suit, but this is overkill, even for him.God, I feel like a right sourpuss right now. Was it all bad? No!! Absolutely not! In fact, there was a lot that was hysterically funny, really well done and OH MY GOD WOLVERINE IN HIS ORIGINAL COSTUME IS THE COOLEST THING EVER AND SOOOOO WORTH THE WAIT!! There will truly never be another Wolverine like Hugh Jackman, and I for one am so thankful that he came back to do this one more time! For this reason alone, this movie is well worth the price of an admission ticket. And yes, some of the cameos are truly awesome - there are a few who were seriously unexpected surprises - and are a joy to watch. But still... I can't shake the feeling that it could have been done very differently. There was just too much of everything, but (and here's the true irony of Deadpool 3) by and large the best scenes were those where Poolboy and Wolfie were alone together. That's where the magic was; they didn't need anyone else. The story was downright idiotic and the main villain was annoying and uninteresting AF, and the few cameos I was truly looking forward to were all so short they barely added anything of value, with a couple of exceptions. And the thing that puzzles me the most is the staggering absence of Vanessa. They already ticked me off by virtually erasing her from DP2, and now she has even less screen time. I don't get it. Not only is her presence Wade's most important driving force, but the chemistry between Ryan Reynolds and Morena Baccarin is so awesome, that I am simply dumbfounded as to why they wouldn't use her more. Oh man, I could go on forever... There is so much that I loved, and so much else that frustrated and confused me.Is it worth it? Yes.Is it all I hoped it would be?

That communal experience is what cinema is all about.However, the film also represents a lot of the issues with modern superhero films:1. An over - reliance on nostalgia; I feel like success in Hollywood has become a waiting game; bring it back 10 - 15 years later, and people will love it.2. A thin, cliched and vague, reality - bending multiverse plot, which often takes a back seat to set pieces, eventually becoming bloated and convoluted.3.

And we finally have the 3rd installment of Deadpool but this time it's going to be under Marvel / Disney. This Deadpool sequel is the first rated R film from any Disney Marvel film and they were able to pull it off nicely overall.The story follows Wade's story from the ending of Deadpool 2 as he tries to search for some place where he can matter again. As the years went by, he was recruited by the TVA for a not so pleasant mission which lead him to different Earths to team up with a Wolverine variant to save his own doomed future. The film is full with action sequences specially the bloody fight scenes between Wolverine and Deadpool. The film was still able to pull off a good plot with good message but I guess what really brings this sequel to the next level are those cameos we did not see coming mixed with those we expected to see and they did not disappoint.Comparing to first DP films, this feels better than Deadpool 2. If you're a movie goer, a Marvel fan, a comic fan, you'll enjoy this movie and the wait is totally worth it. (You can see those bones and blood flying to you when you're in IMAX).

It's filled with well choreographed and fun action sequences that aren't afraid to get gruesome, vicious, and gory. It's jammed with jokes and for the most part they do land. There were times that I did laugh. The performance from Ryan Reynolds is phenomenal. He is Deadpool. In fact, all the performances are great. However, Hugh Jackman is the highlight here. They didn't touch the ending for Logan and I'm happy for it. It's great to see him as Wolverine - in a great costume - being the hysterical yet threatening mutant that we all know and love. The chemistry between the two titular characters are chef's kiss. Of course, there are cameos throughout. Yet, they're unexpectedly high-spirited and out of the blue. They do some slick stuff and were smart who they invited back. Sadly, the story lacks focus. It has a lot of heart and does a good job of developing its central characters. At the same time, it's the same old stuff that we see in previous Marvel flicks. Once again, the villain is underwhelming despite a solid performance from Emma Corrin. Some of the humor didn't land for me even if I did laugh a lot. Also, some of the special effects weren't that great. It's still a good film regardless. The movie is a return to form.

Also, there is an obvious intention to plan the future of the Marvel franchise by recycling the same characters from parallel universes, of which this film is just an announcement.I will add at the very end, the only two bright little spots are the main protagonists Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman, who despite everything showed that they can somehow act in this kind of movie without any inspiration, script and real dialogues.

This is what creates the disonance between a fictional movie that only refers to things that happen in the movies world and a fictional movie that acknowledges real world things. Deadpool takes both as well as references from other completely unrelated fictional movies to frame his jokes. That's why these movies work so well.Deadpools character is molded through Ryan Reynolds. Hes learned over the years what to do and what NOT to do with deadpool through trial and error. He knows what the fans wanna see and this movie spoon fed it to us.Pulling in wolverine was a necessity to this films success. Hugh Jackman...the man you are.

Granted, it was on a Friday night after a somewhat trying day at work, but still...!Two things I did enjoy about it, however.1) The 1980's soundtrack used throughout.

But the third? Deadpool vs Wolverine is entertaining, but what it lacks is any depth or useful plot. There is plenty of comedy, and this movie is funny, but therein lies the problem. Instead of effective jokes this movie depends too heavily on over the top gross out violence and over use of Deadpool's breaking of the the 4th wall. Just like the myriad of cameos in this film its fine, but only works once, because it all leaves nothing to go back to.Both previous Deadpool movies had more involving plots, characters and better jokes. This movie has those things, just not done as well, and perhaps being done too often; proving the rule that more does not always mean better.Another area where this movie fails is its secondary characters. In previous movies these have always been played straight, against which Deadpool can be juxtaposed. But the TVA (a time travel police) are faux comedic and fumbling, and along with other characters give the movie the feeling of being an extended farce rather than an good action movie with great comedy. And that is something the first two Deadpool movies got right.If you like Deadpool, go see this movie. You will enjoy it.

The second one was for me one of the best comic book movies ever, great story, great action, great gags and of course, a great soundtrack! So the bar was already very high for this next one especially with Jackman back! It surpasses expectations! From the BRILLIANT opening credits to the final showdown it is pure brain candy! It has everything you'd expect from a DP movie and more! I won't give any spoilers but hurry up and see it before you hear any! I had my favourite cameo spoiled before seeing it but it didn't ruin anything luckily! This film has single handedly saved the poor excuse that is Marvel these days, this film will do the numbers that endgame did and it deserves to! Endgame was a movie that was totally overhyped and just delivered plot hole after plot hole! This film nails everything it aims at! Jackman is (surprise surprise) brilliant as Logan as usual. The chemistry between him and DP will keep you laughing all the way through, and the violence, well, let's just say it's as graphic and as brutal as you'd expect from these two titans of comics! Ok so without giving ANYTHING away I'll have to stop there! Go see it asap because you WILL want to see it again!

Rating is brought up by the cameos, but the rating was brought down by the Disney brand: To elaborate, the Disney brand has always been about feel good ending with life a lesson. Considering this is an adult movie, the let's all feel good message is exhausting. There were a handful of scenes that were forced to be dramatic, but it just doesn't feel genuine. Action is overwhelmingly redundant. There are several jabs at real life and movie characters that were relatively easy to catch. And there are many more repetitive, alternative lifestyle jokes that are simply played out after two installments. Even though this was enjoyable, I would not want to sit through it again any time soon, hence the six out of ten rating. Worth the watch, yes as six is still better than average.

But I went in open-minded, and the trailers they released were good trailers.Unfortunately, Deadpool & Wolverine doubles down on all things that makes me dislike both the MCU and other Deadpool movies. From the MCU, it has throw away, cardboard cutout villains, an awful and jumbled plot, and an absurd and borderline offensive amount of fan service. From the Deadpool films, it has very one-note ""Can he say that???"" type of humor.This movie pretends to be bold by having Deadpool bravely poke fun at Disney. But the jokes are ultimately very inoffensive to Disney, and obviously corporate approved. It has a scene where they make fun of the multiverse, and yet the whole plot revolves the multiverse, which is a total cop out.The villain is about as simple and boring as they get in the MCU. She's also weirdly overpowered, making me wonder why she didn't just snap her fingers, killing everyone. The plot mechanics are incredibly dull, and it relies way too heavily on fan service. Almost no jokes are told, just references that are lightly humorous. And the references and endless cameos really get old quick. They are there to manipulate viewers into focusing on nostalgia, so we forget that the script is absolutely awful and generic.Deadpool & Wolverine makes me extremely sad that we will no longer get any more films in the original X-Men canon. I now appreciate Logan and even The New Mutants all that much more. Because this really ain't it.

I'm not even sure who this production is actually intended for, because with this amount of gratuitous violence, severed heads, hectoliters of spilled blood, constant swearing, profanity and cheap lines, it's hard to determine the target group that this wish-wash should like.All that aside, the biggest problem is the lack of any meaningful story, even reasonable motivation and characterization of actors, and that the reminders of some other heroes from Marvel history are reduced to literally appearing and disappearing in the next frame, wouldn't it cause a little nostalgia for long ago past better times, which represents, if not an insult to ours specific once-favorite characters, then certainly an insult to the good taste of the aggrieved audience. Also, there is an obvious intention to plan the future of the Marvel franchise by recycling the same characters from parallel universes, of which this film is just an announcement.I will add at the very end, the only two bright little spots are the main protagonists Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman, who despite everything showed that they can somehow act in this kind of movie without any inspiration, script and real dialogues.

This is what creates the disonance between a fictional movie that only refers to things that happen in the movies world and a fictional movie that acknowledges real world things. Deadpool takes both as well as references from other completely unrelated fictional movies to frame his jokes. That's why these movies work so well.Deadpools character is molded through Ryan Reynolds. Hes learned over the years what to do and what NOT to do with deadpool through trial and error. He knows what the fans wanna see and this movie spoon fed it to us.Pulling in wolverine was a necessity to this films success. Hugh Jackman...the man you are.

Just like the myriad of cameos in this film its fine, but only works once, because it all leaves nothing to go back to.Both previous Deadpool movies had more involving plots, characters and better jokes. This movie has those things, just not done as well, and perhaps being done too often; proving the rule that more does not always mean better.Another area where this movie fails is its secondary characters. In previous movies these have always been played straight, against which Deadpool can be juxtaposed. But the TVA (a time travel police) are faux comedic and fumbling, and along with other characters give the movie the feeling of being an extended farce rather than an good action movie with great comedy.

Rating is brought up by the cameos, but the rating was brought down by the Disney brand: To elaborate, the Disney brand has always been about feel good ending with life a lesson. Considering this is an adult movie, the let's all feel good message is exhausting. There were a handful of scenes that were forced to be dramatic, but it just doesn't feel genuine. Action is overwhelmingly redundant. There are several jabs at real life and movie characters that were relatively easy to catch. And there are many more repetitive, alternative lifestyle jokes that are simply played out after two installments. Even though this was enjoyable, I would not want to sit through it again any time soon, hence the six out of ten rating. Worth the watch, yes as six is still better than average.

But I went in open-minded, and the trailers they released were good trailers.Unfortunately, Deadpool & Wolverine doubles down on all things that makes me dislike both the MCU and other Deadpool movies. From the MCU, it has throw away, cardboard cutout villains, an awful and jumbled plot, and an absurd and borderline offensive amount of fan service. From the Deadpool films, it has very one-note ""Can he say that???"" type of humor.This movie pretends to be bold by having Deadpool bravely poke fun at Disney. But the jokes are ultimately very inoffensive to Disney, and obviously corporate approved. It has a scene where they make fun of the multiverse, and yet the whole plot revolves the multiverse, which is a total cop out.The villain is about as simple and boring as they get in the MCU. She's also weirdly overpowered, making me wonder why she didn't just snap her fingers, killing everyone. The plot mechanics are incredibly dull, and it relies way too heavily on fan service. Almost no jokes are told, just references that are lightly humorous. And the references and endless cameos really get old quick. They are there to manipulate viewers into focusing on nostalgia, so we forget that the script is absolutely awful and generic.Deadpool & Wolverine makes me extremely sad that we will no longer get any more films in the original X-Men canon.

But there's one key ingredient missing: heart.Where DP 1&2 had great chemistry between characters, DP&W has nothing, not even between the titular duo. Reynolds and Jackman act out the same caricature in a series of sketches - one is an annoying idiot (this time for real, they managed to dumb down even Deadpool) while another growls angrily. There's no convincing character development or bonding here - just whining that one wants to matter and save his friends while another let everyone down and is thus sad and grumpy. Wade and Vanessa's relationship went from believable and touching to virtually nothing: there's now an implausible problem between them made up specifically for this movie, and it gets resolved automatically for the sake of happy ending without any effort on their part.All of which leads to another big problem of this film - its plot, or rather lack thereof. It is just a messy excuse to tie together a few scenes, and if you take a moment to think about what is happening on screen it falls apart instantaneously. It feels like an elongated SNL sketch, or an R-rated Disneyland attraction - there isn't a story being told, it's just going through motions. Now's the time for the 100th gay sex joke from Deadpool (their concentration increased suspiciously now that it's a Disney production), and now on to an obligatory uninspired blandly-choreographed fight. Quick pause for cameo, repeat for 2 hours straight. The first two Deadpool movies made it just fine without a convincing antagonist, but this time around the two villains are such painfully evident overly-grimacing cardboard cutout cliches that it gets so jarring to watch them.Sure, there are some cameos that are actually surprising and well-done (I didn't watch any trailer past the first one), and jokes that land (do watch the after-credits scene, it's hilarious). Time flies by relatively fast, even if with some drags closer to the third act, and I left the screening with an overall positive impression, but still, sadly, Deadpool & Wolverine is a huge step down compared to Deadpool 1 & 2.",Helpful,•,0,1,realmuthaf,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur54742537/?ref_=tturv_usr_531_t,27-Jul-24,

It's a testament to all that came before (that's what she said). A dedication to the legacy of the superhero movies that paved the way for the juggernaut of the MCU. Filmed for the geeks, the nerds, and the everyday man, like Peter Pool.Deadpool & Wolverine brings every R-rated joke, action, guts, and glory that you'd expect; but take it further just so Deadpool could rub it in Disney's face. Every quick-witted joke and one-liner hit perfectly in a rhythmic script only the Merc with a Mouth could have written. Ryan Reynolds and the brilliant Shawn Levy make a dynamic duo that was destined to lead up to this masterpiece after recent hits Free Guy and The Adam Project. This movie, with all its callbacks, head-nods, and inside joke references exemplifies the definition of a film being a slice of the time that it was made. They did what all fans of Marvel craved for-they came together to make a geek's wet dream come true.Bringing Hugh Jackman back alone qualifies this three-quel to be awesome but they took the iconic pairing to the next level with outlandish action comedy and a surprising amount of heartfelt moments throughout. Of course, there are plenty of top-tier talent in the supporting cast-whose identities will be kept under the sewn-shut mouth of X-Men Origin's Deadpool. Although what can be revealed is how much Deadpool 3 cares about respecting the legacy of the Fox X-Men universe; its characters and movies, no matter how good or bad they were, started the superhero era and deserve the credit.The hype surrounding this movie was easily bumped up by the masterfully clever marketing as Deadpool snuck into every car, beer and mattress commercial. Expectations were high but the trailers holding back spoilers helped to propel this film into a perfect storm where it blew all our minds-at once, Wade Wilson style. This story boils down to an action romantic comedy involving one immortal man-child and his Twitter-feud arch-nemesis saving the day one dirty joke at a time.

I see some reviews complaining that this was worse than the other two, I'd argue that they probably simply matured into whatever this humor is no longer as effective as it was when they saw the first two because it is exactly the same in terms of humor, The story is not oscar worthy, none of them are, but that is not why you go watch these films, for me the best thing about it was the huge amount of cameos even if they didn't make much sense, as someone who watches a lot of movies, it was fun. The rest of the humor is mostly references to existing material being other movies or characters or lines, even the will smith oscar slap, and some sex related jokes, exactly what you would expect from a deadpoool movie.I do wish the story was deeper, made more sense, played more with the multiverse, hell maybe even a TV show of 5 great creative episodes would have been nice, just to get more immersed with the characters, and boy there are many in this one! But they barely get any screen time because of that. And I with the humor was juuuuust a little smarter, with hidden jokes within jokes, background details, anything that could make the jokes not feel so flat and predictable.

Stabbing and blood oozing out is not something I would categorize as adult.One particular scene was really powerful and I think you will get to know which one.All in all a good watch. Not a really great rebound for Marvel but certainly a good one.,Helpful,•,2,2,ronitsriv,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur148159606/?ref_=tturv_usr_540_t,12-Aug-24,

For the Marvel enthusiast, it truly delivers in spades. The film is chock-full of Easter eggs and cheeky cameos, making it a veritable treasure trove for fans. And finally, after all this time, we get to see Deadpool and Wolverine face off. It's everything one might have hoped for-gore, quick-witted humor, and all wrapped up in those delightfully saturated, eye-popping colors. There's a lively energy about it that keeps you grinning throughout.However, if I may be so bold, the plot could have benefitted from a more formidable villain. One craves a foe worthy of these two iconic characters-a larger, more imposing threat would have truly elevated the stakes. But even with this minor quibble, the film is an absolute hoot from start to finish. It's fun, it's vibrant, and you simply can't help but enjoy the ride.",Helpful,•,2,1,snewkyblinders,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur158967194/?ref_=tturv_usr_541_t,4-Oct-24,

I'm glad Stan Lee is not around to see this. At this point Ryan is just beating the heck out of an already dying horse. It's just weird.The Marvel universe is based on the great comic book heroes that Stan Lee created. For the most part, morally sound individuals who try to do the right things and help others. Reynolds has been intentionally endeavoring to belittle and demean the whole universe and all its characters. He seems oblivious to the fact that Stan Lee's morally sound heroes have consistently been tremendous role models, especially for young people. He seems fixated on perverting the whole thing. Or he just doesn't care. Either way, it's weird.",Helpful,•,4,9,underscoremikecastaneda,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur30104437/?ref_=tturv_usr_542_t,28-Aug-24,

They should have gotten someone a bit better at acting.Absolutely loved how clearly Ryan put a Wales flag on one of the Deadpool people. Loved seeing it, I'm a huge fan of that too.Some of things Ryan bought up was hilarious...Disney lol.

7,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw10005706/?ref_=tturv_perm_545,The Future Of The MCU Is The Present Of The MCU,"I remember when Deadpool (2016) was released, it was literally said that, although it could hardly be called a perfect movie (perhaps due to the genre), it was a movie that definitely has nothing wrong or nothing to criticize. I, personally, give it a perfect 4.5 stars. And although with Deadpool 2 (2018) one could be a little more critical due to many nonsensical things that happen in it, it leaves the same feeling: a good movie without trying to do anything other than entertain you.And we arrive at 2024, a year in which the only hope for Disney and the MCU is that the incorporation of the mouthy mercenary into their universe is a box office success. Unfortunately, it was.I say ""unfortunately"" because, even though the movie was a box office success, I can't help but see everything that is wrong with it. You have Ryan Reynolds' Deadpool and Hugh Jackman's Wolverine together on screen after almost 20 years of wanting it. It's impossible to say you don't have a good time at the cinema: you have fun, you laugh and you enjoy the action scenes, the references and the cameos to the fullest. OMG the cameos! Definitely, the best thing about this movie are the cameos from the FOX saga. But, if you take away the hype that those cameos create, you're left with only excellent protagonists, but without any good or even coherent backstory.Although I'm not quite sure how the film industry works, I like to think that I would be a fan of writers, because, for me, they are the ones who create the stories, the most entertaining part. However, I find it incredible to think that, with so much money invested in movies, a writer cannot make a coherent and simple story that can be incorporated into the universe. This situation was caused by themselves by creating this multiversal mess, and at the same time making a criticism of the production system that is the film industry.I know that the excuse can be that the writer does not follow the universe to the letter or watch all the movies they have made, but then, why does Disney expect us to do so in order to catch all the references they make? Why can't they just give the writers the basis so they can create a story that has the minimum congruence and fits, instead of adding more subthemes, developments and complexities about universes and time travel? Things that we don't need. We are at the stage where the MCU should start to come together, focusing on the ideas presented in all its different movies, and not creating more and complex situations that make no sense for those already described previously in the universe or for the viewers.That's why, while the movie was a box office success and delighted us with the characters and cameos, it was definitely a failure in terms of the story and its connection to the MCU, which, by the way, is not even clear or established as to how the incorporation of the FOX universe will work. At least not for me. In my opinion, that won't happen. Deadpool & Wolverine (2024) felt more like a closure and farewell to the FOX universe than a welcome to the Disney universe.",Helpful,•,3,3,armandicoag,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur90171434/?ref_=tturv_usr_545_t,11-Sep-24,
4,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw10042070/?ref_=tturv_perm_546,The worst of the 3,"TL;DR: turn off your brain for 2 hours & pretend to be entertained.I actually believed they would've pulled off somewhat of a masterpiece. But this was 2 hours of shameless, pitiful fan pandering with little to no focus to everything else that should matter to a so-called super-action flick. Story and combat.It falls short on both. Plot is lame as hell, with the uber-predictable ""save your universe from extinction at the hands of Skeletal Bald 5-foot Chick villain of the week at the 11th hour"".And when the narrative isn't blatantly sucking off Wolverine, it just serves a never-ending Exposition train & lame telegraphed one-liners about how bad Marvel has been doing, taken directly from Instagram comments of random people with 0 posts and private profiles.The fight scenes are below par with far too much focus on close-quarters combat, which is probably due to their ages - Ryan is almost 50 and Hugh is nearing 60.And the cameos. Well, I don't know Ryan's history with everyone else but the return of Wesley Snipes as Blade, considering the bad history between the 2, seems like a Pity Job designed to humiliate the man now that Wesley is in the movie that Ryan is in charge of, instead of the other way around. Making him smile like an idiot donkey at the end was far too obvious.After all we all know how fake-nice guy Ryan treats those he doesn't like, made apparent by showing the famous Avengers 2012 action shot that gets cut off abruptly just before it shows Black Widow - Ryan's real-life ex who he heavily resented because she's a successful independent woman and he's an extremely insecure little man. Hence why he married a nobody after her, so he can be the star of the family.Quite ironic seeing how it's fairly obvious Ryan's star is fading fast. Nothing he's done outside Deadpool in the last 10 years is ever mentioned. Which is perfectly reflected in DP3. A stale, unfunny nostalgia act. And if this is what it takes to gross over 1 billion at the box office in 2024...cinema is well and truly doomed.Ryan's fragile ego might as well have left in the Captain Marvel & She-Hulk cameos because it's not like they would've made the movie any worse than it actually is. He managed that all on his own. I'm glad Marvel/Disney put their foot down and stonewalled him on releasing the bonus footage he wanted to show off to please his ego.

It is a raunchy, over the top, action filled, comedy that still manages to do what I love aabout all of the deadpool movies: It has heart. Moments of gravity that ground the movie and makes you care about the characters. Hugh Jackman returning was done (dis)tastfully in a way that works for fans of Logan, like my self, and people who just wanted to see the team up. No spoilers, but the amount of special cameos and refrences in the movie are a treasure trove of rewatchability! The writing was spectacular and everything else from the cinematography to the special effects and soundtrack were top notch! I can see why someone might not like it in the sense that it is a lot, the villain motivations are a little weak, but they drive the plot forward in a way that makes it feel equal parts world ending and personal. I'd put it just below the first one in terms of over all enjoyment and slightly above 2.

This was soon followed by trepidation that the film would ruin the sensational and emotional rollercoaster that is Logan.I needn't have worried.What I found with D&W was a film breathing new life in to the Marvel franchise. Since Avengers: Endgame there have been a lot of poor quality Marvel exploits and finally here is a great addition that sits up there with the likes of Thor: Ragnarok and Guardians of the Galaxy.As much as I would love to review the content of the film, that isn't going to happen. There is no way I could get through a whole sentence without giving away a spoiler or two so if you are yet to see it, my recommendation would be to do so before anything is ruined.The chemistry between Reynolds and Jackman shines throughout and the ensemble works beautifully. There is, of course, much inappropriate behaviour from Deadpool, making this arguably the funniest edition to the series, but what stands out the most is the heart with which the film is built on. A cinematic experience that was worth waiting for, let's hope there is more to come soon from the 'Marvel Jesus'.",Helpful,•,4,3,calummacleod-51310,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur160846329/?ref_=tturv_usr_549_t,15-Aug-24,

And I don't find Ryan Reynolds too irritating. However, this film. This film feels like it was conceived and written by an MCU fan, who drank far too much caffeine and eat far too much laxative- and this film was the result.Reynolds just does Reynolds, so the snarky 4th wall stuff is exciting acted and predictable. Hugh Jackman seems, conversely, to take things far too seriously, so the juxtaposition of the two really grates.The ret in f the film is just a mess of ideas and vague storylines. The CGi is decent, but the script, partly because Reynolds eats it, is entirely forgettable. The one decent highlight is Emma Corrin as the baddy, she deserves her own shot at a film.The film was a mildly diverting 2 hours out of the rain.",Helpful,•,6,7,Blimplarg,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur167586430/?ref_=tturv_usr_550_t,6-Aug-24,
