Sometimes it's a little awkward. It's a little worst when compared to Ragnarok. I never bought into the Thor and Jane Foster romance. Basically, Jane turns into a girlie puddle in the presence of Chris Hemsworth's muscles. It's fine but it's no Romeo and Juliet. At least in this one, Natalie Portman has many dimensions to play. Her character has so much more. With more daring, this would be a two person journey. Thor could really dig into his relationship with Jane.

Waititi goes all out to make an absurdist comedy here and inserts himself into the film way too much, not only co-starring but narrating the darn thing too. And a little of his trademark humour goes a long way, as it turns out. The storyline's okay, Hemsworth is very funny too, but Portman's return is mishandled and her character arc so serious to be completely at odds with the overwhelming goofiness elsewhere.

8,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8321515/?ref_=tturv_perm_3,Silly God/Goat,"Round two ... my internet really pulled one on me. I had the complete review written and then it ... well it went away. So from the start - and probably a bit different than the other review I wrote. A bit like the Thor you get here. Taika reinvented him for Ragnarok - and he even went further with this installment.You have to dig what he does - and his humor too of course. I understand that some do not like the humor. You can't fault the movie technically speaking though. Ask (your) kids - maybe you got a bit weary, but they surely haven't. And the darkness that Christian Bale brings to his role (great as always of course), will not faze them either.Bale who gets introduced first in the movie. Might be a (new) trend for Marvel. Giving us the bad guy, before we see the good guy(s). Moon Knight did the same (Ms. Marvel did not of course), but let's keep an eye out for that.Bales character is not alone when he gets introduced. There is someone with him. And while you may want to forget about it. Bale will not let you. He will keep talking about that character - so much so, that you may get a bit annoyed. But there is a reason (or two, no pun intended) for that.Everyone except Bale can show off their silly side. Adding a bit of gravitas from time to time. But the darker tone and mood is kept for Bale and his character. He may not have much screentime, but the movie called Thor (whoever that might be - you probably have seen the trailer so you have an idea I reckon).But apart from reintroducing characters to us, the movie is also reintroducing the Thor (movie) mythology to us. So if you or the little one you are with or whoever have not seen the previous movies, you get a ""what happened"" at the beginning. Not everything will be rehashed. There is another flashback kept for later in the movie.This is the fourth Thor movie and aside of Hugf Jackman as Wolverine, no one has played a comic book character as long as Chris Hemsworth has. And the latter has gone through quite the transformations. I understand if you are not into the humor.I myself had an issue with another character (that you may already know is in the movie). The portrayal and the accent seemed weird to say the least. But even though I had my own preconceptions about that ... I'll call it character, I understand that Taika only wanted to do his thing. I did not know he was part of the Marvel comic book cannon to be honest, but I am not as involved in the comics as others are.So while there is not much story here (getting from point a to b and all that), there are a lot of cool set pieces. And a lot of weird (Taika) humor. Like him expanding the God universe if you want to call it that. Which is sort of the scene I was talking about above.It all makes sense in the end though and for me the balance between silly and drama did work. You have to suspend your disbelief, maybe drink a little bit of that kool aid and just go with the flow.I for my part am happy Thor is back. At the end of Avengers Endgame, no one seemed to know (apart from Kevin Feige probably), if any of the surviving (and available, no pun intended to the ""old"" man, who passed on ... well you know what) characters would return. So seeing Thor get into the Guardians of the Galaxy ship really made me hope he'd return. I thought it would be in a Guardians movie, but it's them who were in this ... at least for a little bit. A funny little bit that is.And then you have the end credits scenes. People should be aware of them, but still some get up and leave. As with most MCU movies (minus Endgame), you get some bonus and look into the future. One scene during the credits and one after ... both are promising and really great to say the least.So sit back, relax and let the (mostly) lightness wash over you ... it would be a shame if you couldn't. I just had to laugh, because there is a moment where Thor is naked. You don't see a front shot of that, but you do get to see his behind ... uncensored, if that means anything to you. It's another joke and it does work quite well too (no pun intended).Edit: almost completely forgot a few important things. One thing I am surprised by. Well the non reaction from people who are into religion (no matter what kind) that is. Because the movie essentially is critisizing almost everything about religion. It does make fun of Gods ... no pun intended. This is more than the silly depiction of Thor. This is kind of an atheist ... well heaven (another pun I know). It is underlying, but it is not subtle to be honest.And of course the music - Guns N Roses for the win as some might say. Music apparently played a big role during the making of the movie. And if you don't mind classic rock as I reckon people would call it now ... well you could do a lot worse.",Helpful,•,26,32,kosmasp,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur5876717/?ref_=tturv_usr_3_t,10-Jul-22,

And I have to admit that this wasn't a movie that I was going to be rushing out to the cinema to watch.But now that it has become readily available for the streaming masses, of course I opted to watch it. Granted, I am not really much of a superhero movie fan, but I do watch them for their entertainment value. And Marvel Studios do tend to make some entertaining enough superhero-based movies.Writers Taika Waititi and Jennifer Kaytin Robinson managed to put together a very entertaining movie here. And I don't really understand all the grief that this movie has been getting. But hey, I suppose every movie franchise has a group of toxic fans. I was genuinely entertained by ""Thor: Love and Thunder"". And it turned out to be a good combination of archetypical superhero movie mixed with comedy. I liked that particular approach that director Taika Waititi took with this movie.The storyline was good and well-written. It definitely felt like a ""Thor"" movie, and also like something you would find within the pages of a Marvel comic book. So thumbs up on that accomplishment.Something that really impressed me with ""Thor: Love and Thunder"" was the cast ensemble. This movie has so many talents on the cast list, granted lots of them in smaller roles, but it was such a great cast ensemble. But the real stars of the movie were the two giant goats. They just cracked me up.Visually then ""Thor: Love and Thunder"" was everything you would expect from a Marvel Studios movie. Lots of great visuals, vibrant colors, fantastic costume designs, amazing sets, and so forth. So you are in for quite a visual treat here with this movie.As for the music in the movie, well, that was a mixed bag of nuts. The score was good, but the songs in the movie, well, not so much.

6,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8310061/?ref_=tturv_perm_14,the comic book look,"Greetings again from the darkness. With a steady stream of Marvel movies and TV serials, maintaining coherent and connected storylines has become challenging. In fact, it's probably best if fans take these at face value, rather struggling to connect the dots, only to end up frustrated. Perhaps no one understands this better than Taika Waititi, the director behind what many (including me) consider the best MCU film, THOR: RAGNAROK (2017). Waititi and co-writer Jennifer Kaytin Robinson once again embrace the blend of quick quip comedy and expected action sequences, supplemented this time a love story.The pre-opening credits sequence provides the backstory for the film's villain, Gorr the God Butcher, played by Oscar winner Christian Bale. Gorr has spent a lifetime worshipping the Sun God, only to realize his worshipping has occurred in an actual God-forsaken world that costs him dearly. Gorr ends up learning the lesson of 'never meet your heroes', and this confrontation gives him the power and curse of the Necrosword, and sets him on a revenge mission to kill all Gods. We have to respect a villain who has a legitimate claim to his mission - it's not just a thirst for world domination. Gorr wants the Gods to pay for their ambivalence.We then pick up Thor Odinson (Chris Hemsworth) as he has been fighting with the Guardians of the Galaxy since the end of AVENGERS: ENDGAME (2019). With no shortage of characters who excel in comedy, this sequence shifts us into laughter and light-hearted mode after the bleak Gorr opening. It's this pacing that holds for most of the movie ... Waititi never lets things stay too serious for very long. Soon, Thor splits off from the Guardians, as he returns to New Asgard, being run by King Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson). Now based on Earth, New Asgard is a theme park and tourist attraction. One of the features is the theater acting group we've seen previously, and this time Matt Damon, Luke Hemsworth, and Sam Neill are joined by Melissa McCarthy as Hela. While this is going on, we learn Thor's old flame, astrophysicist Jane Foster (Oscar winner Natalie Portman) is now an author being treated for Stage 4 cancer. A trip to New Asgard provides her strength as the shattered Mjolnir hammer magically re-forms in her presence. Jane's story boils down to whether she wants to try to extend her life through science or live every remaining day to it's fullest.Gorr kidnaps the Asgardian kids, forcing Thor, Valkyrie, Korg (voiced again by Waititi), and Mighty Thor/Jane Foster to track him to the Realm of Shadows. Their plan is to stop by Omnipotence City to request assistance from the almighty Zeus (Russell Crowe). They are shocked to discover that Zeus is little more than a colorful televangelist with a Borat accent performing a whiz-bang show so that he can get on to the next orgy. Zeus refuses to assist with an army, but he does manage to chain Thor and strip him nekkid centerstage. The good guys nab Zeus' golden lightning bolt and head off to rescue the kids and confront Gorr.In a reverse Wizard of Oz twist, the films turns to Black & White when they reach the Realm of Shadows. It's an eerie environment befitting Gorr. Bale is certainly at his best when he is terrifying and menacing, although the writing is a bit inconsistent for the character, and sometimes it drifts into Pennywise mode, a definite drop in suspense. The action sequences are fine, but really nothing we haven't seen before. And that's probably the biggest issue with all superhero/comic book stories these days. Anything new must come from the story or the characters, and we know the characters far too well at this point.Waititi's version delivers many laughs throughout. Among the best is the odd relationship between Thor and his hammer Mjolnir and his axe Stormbreaker. Thor's jealousy of his ex-hammer hooking up with his ex-girlfriend is almost as funny as Stormbreaker's jealousy of Thor trying to steal back the hammer. Also cool is Thor's homage to Jean-Claude Van Damme, and the look of the Altar of Eternity, where one last wish is granted. Maybe not as effective is the apparent Guns 'n Roses fetish or Jane's struggle to come up with a catchphrase. Sure to be a divisive element is the recurring gag of bleating goats ... I found them hilarious, but many won't. Another piece that simply didn't work for me is Ms. Portman's performance, especially in the scenes with Hemsworth. Her comic timing can't match his, and it's a match that just never clicks.Obviously, the characters originated from the minds of Stan Lee and Jason Aaron in Marvel Comics, and it's Taika Waititi who brings his unique touch to the project. Since he directed THOR: RAGNAROK, he won a screenplay Oscar for JOJO RABBIT (2019), and I've been a fan of his style dating back to EAGLE VS SHARK (2007), and on to the brilliant HUNT FOR THE WILDERPEOPLE (2016), and TV series ""What We Do in the Shadows"". Waititi is scheduled to direct a Star Wars movie in the near future - one surely to be divisive among that fan base. As for this latest Thor movie, it may be tonally jagged and have a few too many zippy quips for some, but it manages to be silly and tender and emotional, while having the look and feel of a comic book come to life.

Seriously, it's like a half-hearted first draft. Lacking the charm, wit, wonder and chaotic energy of Taika Waititi's previous foray into the MCU, the film chugs along at its own meandering pace as it tells a simple story as straightforwardly as it can. Some of it has a lot of potential and some of it is even fairly good, but all of it is undercut by the almost oppressively unfunny screenplay that has no idea how to balance its tone. I could probably sue for neck injuries thanks to a couple of these instances of total tonal whiplash. The movie just isn't fun, either. It certainly isn't the sort of devil-may-care comedy you may expect from those involved. Despite a handful of jokes that I recall making me think ""that's quite funny"" (but, crucially, never making me laugh), the experience of watching this is a maddeningly straight-faced affair. I mean, it's like the easiest 'you laugh, you lose' challenge in the world, so much so that most of the humour doesn't even seem like it's trying to make you laugh even though it obviously is. The whole thing is actually kind of embarrassing, the equivalent of watching a screening of someone's University work that they clearly scraped together mere moments before they were due to present it. I'll highlight the few things that I feel work about the picture. Firstly, Jane's storyline has a lot of potential and comes close to being affecting on a couple of occasions. It unfortunately isn't capitalised on fully, but it's undeniably the heart of the story and brings the chemistry between Natalie Portman and Chris Hemsworth back into the fray. Secondly, Gorr's motivation is believable and his presentation is often fairly unsettling (thanks, in no small part, to the stellar work from an out-of-place Christian Bale). His introductory sequence is mostly stellar, until it eventually gets too silly for its own good, and the payoff to his arc is as mature as it is satisfying (despite the denouement's somewhat clumsy handling of its consequences). Finally, there are a couple of action sequences that are presented with distinct aesthetics that bring to mind the best work of Zack Snyder. The golden shower skirmish is probably the movie's most entertaining set-piece, whereas the gang's extended stint in the shadow realm builds on the flick's most disquieting scene to present a relatively eerie battle that's genuinely aesthetically interesting. Despite these limited successes, the picture is easily one of the worst in the entire MCU. Much like 'Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness (2022)' before it, it simply doesn't feel like an actual film. It has all the elements that ought to make for a strong superhero story, but it squanders each and every one to emerge as nothing more than an absolute mess.",Helpful,•,3,4,Pjtaylor-96-138044,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur26820801/?ref_=tturv_usr_19_t,21-Sep-22,
6,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8306317/?ref_=tturv_perm_20,"Thor's cosmic adventure has enough thunder and laughs, but enough boring love too.","Thor: Love and Thunder (2022):
Movie Review -Marvel Studios' Thor: Love And Thunder, starring Chris Hemsworth, Christian Bale, Tessa Thompson, Russell Crowe, and Natalie Portman, introduces you to some new Superheroes, Gods and Villains. Some of them are too good even as newcomers, while some are too predictable as the old ones. From the trailer, you get the overall idea of the script, be it characters, suspense, or adventure, and the final outcome doesn't go beyond that, except for one thing. However, it makes sure to fulfil all the criteria of Marvel's Superhero Entertainer, which leaves you satisfied by the end. Love, Thunder, and Laughs: Thor's cosmic adventure ticks all three boxes, despite a few boring aspects. I wish Thunder was in the lead, though.Thor 4 starts off with an introduction scene of the antagonist, Gorr, who becomes the God Butcher after his God fails him. We get back to New Asgard, which is quite like a corporate city and visually lavish, where Korg (Taika Waititi) keeps telling the legends of Thor, aka God of Thunder. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) attempts to find inner peace after losing the love of his life (three times, OMG!), but must return to action to prevent Gorr from murdering the Gods. Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson) and Korg join his army, and then appears Thor's ex-girlfriend Jane Foster ( Natalie Portman), aka Mighty Thor, with Thor's ex-weapon, Mjolnir, to support him, of course.Thor: Love And Thunder might just bore you with typical romance and illogical reconciliation (you might even end up asking why it was there if it wasn't supposed to make any sense, and you won't even get answers), but it covers the loss with explosive action and thrilling adventures. It's a topic of discussion why every superhero film should have a romantic angle to spoil the structure. Of course, not every superhero film can be intellectual like ""The Dark Knight"", and Marvel never wished to match Nolan's intelligence with their money-spinner entertainers. Yet we have that boring romance, parting and reconciliation just to look down and check if our popcorn is finished or not. Thor: Love And Thunder has many moments like this. It's unfathomable how Thor and Jane's love story was left incomplete before the mighty assembly of Avengers, and how it suddenly pops up in the post Thanos era. 8 years or something, as Thor says, who was counting anyway, and what was she doing in the meantime? One of the most pressing questions is why the Guardians of the Galaxy suddenly disappeared. Let's not expect any answers from Marvel.Coming to performances, Thor: Love and Thunder is blessed with Christian Bale's supremacy. He is truly deadly and dark as Gorr and makes you forget many former villains with his impeccable presence. Thor, aka Chris Hemsworth, gets back into his old shoes again and the size still fits him. Not just the physical transformation, but his verbal transformation also clicks well. This time he is more funny and child-friendly, that's some good change after ""The Dark World"" and ""Ragnarok"". Tessa Thompson and Taika Waititi have limited space but do well, whereas Natalie Portman is charming as Mighty Thor and damn boring as Jane Forster. I was expecting Russell Crowe to spread a surprise, but the screen time and role both came out quite underwhelming. Nevertheless, he has a surprise for you in the end credits scene that might just erase previous low grade marks.Marvel's cosmic adventure is visually splendid, and you don't expect anything less in this department, at least. But still, Thor: Love and Thunder goes beyond expectations to leave you in awe with some enchanting and colourful visuals. This may surprise you, but Thor: Love And Thunder also has some dark visuals, and they are unexpectedly awe-spiring. The background score and cinematography seemed okay, while the editing remained crispy most of the time. The tedious romance could have been trimmed a little and easily been replaced by action scenes or comedy to make it more engaging, but what's done is done now.Taika Waititi will be remembered for bringing a bewitching change to Thor's universe with ""Thor: Ragnarok"" (2017). This man pulled Thor out of a dark and intense world and made him more funny and amusing with his commercial vision. With Thor: Love and Thunder, he continues the flow and keeps you smiling all the time. Taika has increased humour and children-oriented theories that should widen Thor's reach to different age groups. However, he fails to make a theoretical sense. But who cares about that when you are watching an MCU product? Chuck the brain, let the chicks and eyes enjoy the show. As a whole, Thor's cosmic adventure is as entertaining as you'd expect, with some new surprises in store.RATING - 6/10*",Helpful,•,8,26,SAMTHEBESTEST,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur50463365/?ref_=tturv_usr_20_t,6-Jul-22,

It's good that Waititi didn't give a rat's behind about anything and just made an entertaining film instead! If you liked Ragnarök, you will probably like this one, too.It's not all perfect, though. The first half an hour felt like a long exposition on an amateur theater stage. The next half of hour seemed like every friend of Taika's showed up for a cameo and a free lunch. The film never takes itself seriously, which is either good or bad, depending on your expectations. Also, it felt like a lot of stuff was crammed into one hour and a half and maybe a two hour movie wouldn't have been so... staccato.Yet the pros are stronger than the cons: Christian Bale did great with the few scenes where he got to act, there was a lot of humor and the Guns'n'Roses theme of the film helped a lot with the heroic battle scenes. Hemsworth's charisma was at full strength and even Natalie Portman's character, usually a filler with little agency, was interesting and fun.

However, what happens in between, particularly the humour I found to be very hit and miss. I do appreciate though that humour is in the eye of the beholder and others may find that it works.There is one concept associated with the Jane Foster character that was a great idea and the most serious aspect of the plot. Having this in a screenplay that tries to be mostly funny could have worked had the comedy been better, however for me the jokes are not strong enough to pull it off.The funniest parts involve the Guardians of the Galaxy characters interacting with Thor. From then on it relies exchanges between Thor, Valkarie and Jane to entertain. The actors do a great job with the lines, but I don't think the banter is funny or witty enough during the majority of the scenes.The scene involving Zeus is not overly bad, but again I didn't find the material good enough to be played as much for laughs as it is. Personally I think they should have done it as a suspenseful dramatic sequence, with light elements of humour and have the heroes emerge triumphantly to the same piece of music.Christian Bale's performance is a big positive and he brings to life one of the better MCU baddies. Chris Hemsworth leads it very well. Natalie Portman is good and so is Tessa Thompson.As you would expect from a Disney product, the visuals are quite spectacular, but for me scenes of superheroes battling various computer generated monsters all blend into one these days.

5,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8311620/?ref_=tturv_perm_27,Highly disappointing,"This review will come off as very negative, but I had a decent time, laughed a lot, and was fairly entertained. As a big-time MCU fan though, Love and Thunder is highly disappointing, even more so for an OG Avenger.For reference, I loved all of the previous Thor movies. Many people view the first two as bottom tier MCU but I think they're beastly and beautiful in a Shakespearian way, while also being funny and visually stunning. Then they went in a new direction with Ragnarok, and I was completely on board. I enjoyed the infusion of style and almost all of the humor works.Love and Thunder goes so far past Ragnarok in every way. So much of it doesn't work for me. So much of the humor is predictable and goofy, to the point of bordering on cartoonish. And there isn't nearly enough serious to balance out the comedy. Combine that with some odd decisions later in the movie and... it kind of feels like they're turning Thor into a joke.And don't get me started on a repeated joke involving two goats that made me think of Jar Jar. I didn't laugh the first time or the 20 times after.Other than the comedy, a lot of Love and Thunder doesn't feel fully natural. Something feels off. The action scenes aren't memorable. By comparison, Ragnarok has multiple action scenes that make my jaw drop. There are some beautiful shots, but not nearly as often as the artwork in the previous ones.But my biggest disappointment is the villain. I don't watch trailers and didn't know Christian Bale is in this movie. He is my favorite actor ever, and has been for the last 15 years. Even with all the amazing talent in this remarkable MCU cast list, IMO Bale stands out above them all. I was ecstatic...Until I realized he's barely in the movie. He gives a great performance, but the script does not flesh him out, does not explore his character, and in effect, turns him into another forgettable MCU villain. Wasting Bale like this is a horrendous decision...Especially after an amazing opening scene that made me think this movie might be on a different level. I can only imagine what could have been if 40% of the movie was dedicated to that character. I can only imagine how amazing it would have been if they treated the God Butcher like The Dark Knight treated Joker.Why couldn't they balance out the serious and the funny? A good example: Guardians 2 is so funny and can get pretty goofy, but it has tons of serious and emotionally powerful scenes. Another example: Deadpool 2 is primarily a comedy but has SO many emotional moments, some to the point of tears.IMO, Love and Thunder doesn't come close to the last two MCU movies (Multiverse of Madness and No Way Home). As it stands today, this is bottom 3 in the MCU for me.EDIT: I decided to give this another shot. Sometimes it's easier the second time without the hype and knowing what to expect. But I felt pretty much the same. I enjoyed a lot of it, but the stuff I disliked bothered me just as much.The two things that stood out to me the second time around, Bale's performance is amazing and they are idiots for underutilizing him. And the goats are the single worst thing in the entire MCU. Changing rating from 6 to 5 stars.

6,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8324871/?ref_=tturv_perm_28,Gorr Blimey!,"""Thor: Ragnarok"" is, for me, one of the highlights of the MCU so far. The broadest comedy of the series and almost a reinterpretation of the character of Thor that sticks to this day. So, anticipation was high for ""Love and Thunder"", perhaps too high, as having seen the film it's a 'like' rather than a 'love' for me.Having received a distress call from Lady Sif (Jamie Alexander), Thor (Chris Hemsworth) returns to New Asgard in time to intercept an attack from Gorr The God Butcher (Christian Bale). He is not alone though, as alongside Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson), Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) has taken the power of The Mighty Thor by reuniting the shattered Mjolnir. Though they repel Gorr's attack, his minions kidnap the children of the town forcing the three heroes to begin an assault, but not before they look to the other gods for assistance.For me, the problem wasn't too much humour, or too weak humour. I thought that Christian Bale's Gorr was a compelling villain and like many MCU antagonists was justified in his rationale. I liked the performances, even some of the ones that people have found controversial, such as Russell Crowe's Zeus. I thought the film looked excellent and the transitions into the black and white sections were great. I think my problem was that it skirted over a bunch of ideas without ever going deep enough on any of them, particularly when some of them have been anticipated for a while. Asguardians of the Galaxy was fun whilst it lasts, but over before the film really starts. The kingdom of the gods, again amusing, but lacking in cameos we might have expected (Khonshu?) and really not much more than a way of padding the film out. Even Jane Foster's Mighty Thor isn't in the film enough to be explored properly. I appreciate that not all actors are willing to do nothing except play their Marvel characters, but I'd have preferred two separate films, one for the adventures of Thor with the GOTG and another full film for Jane to become accustomed to her powers, then have them reconnect. I'd also have liked slightly fewer call backs, the attempt to recapture the Immigrant song moment is overdone, as are the returns for the acting troop.Again, I don't think that this is the disaster that some other reviewers have made it out to be but it's certainly not all I hoped it would be.",Helpful,•,0,11,southdavid,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0715971/?ref_=tturv_usr_28_t,11-Jul-22,
6,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9547807/?ref_=tturv_perm_29,"""Thor: Love and Thunder"" does not innovate and follows the studio's usual structure and formula and the feeling is of wasted potential with the themes and characters","Taika Waititi is once again in charge of the production, bringing his comedic approach, half parody and half sketch, which transforms Thor into a kind of crazy Flash Gordon. Many critics and a good portion of the public really liked what Waititi did in ""Ragnarok"", presenting us with a pastel space opera bursting with color, rock, humor and lots of action. Unfortunately, the sequel fails to reach the same level of quality and fun as the previous film. The film's main problem is that the plot has a lot to deal with in its two hours or so of projection. And it is precisely this ambition of wanting to deal with so many materials at the same time that becomes a double-edged sword for the film. Thor, Jane and Gorr have their own narrative arcs (with Jane and Gorr's being particularly interesting) that share the screen with King Valkyrie dictating the future of New Asgard, with the typical New Asgard gags and with the usual expansion of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It's all very good, but the narrative has difficulty balancing all of this - and the production having four editors working on the film in the editing room didn't help.One of the negative aspects of the work begins with the Guardians of the Galaxy. In terms of continuity in the MCU, it's strange that the group of heroes is basically a footnote in the film. It would be genuinely fun to have an adventure between them and Thor, especially in regards to the chemistry between Hemsworth and Chris Pratt. However, considering the salary of some actors, the script that is already bloated without the group's participation and even the work to reconcile the schedules of so many artists, it is possible to understand in terms of production why the Guardians' participation is quick. But the main problem with the sequence is the fact that it is only the first of many isolated blocks of the film, with Taika structuring the narrative in a fragmented way. We have the block in New Asgard, then in the pantheon of gods, later in the Shadow Dimension and so on. It is a script full of ""mini-adventures"", which are types of sketches, all disjointed and poorly connected.The director is unable to explore the different scenarios in depth as he had done on Sakaar in the previous feature. Take, for example, that whole sequence with the gods, where the full potential of a truly crazy nucleus is restricted to a discussion between Thor and Zeus (Russell Crowe), with the Greek god doing some dances and the Asgardian team defeating some soldiers without expression. The New Zealand director's total lack of creativity is unbelievable, summing up his cinematic approach to showing Thor without clothes and placing Crowe in a totally embarrassing role. The scenes in New Asgard, despite being fun with the Disneyland thing, follow a similar path, little exploring society or any aspect of the people of Asgard so that there is more time for the play with special appearances by Matt Damon, Luke Hemsworth, Sam Neill and Melissa McCarthy. Even the dramatic segment of Jane Foster's (Natalie Portman) return is handled with an irritatingly superficial narrative economy, problematizing the issue of cancer in just four scenes. There is no time for anything in this film, for the characters to be developed, for the adventure to breathe and for all these space scenarios to be thoroughly enjoyed.The second problem is the way the narrative makes transitions between adventure blocks. Taika simply has the characters travel left and right through their weapons, demonstrating an immense laziness to build a truly organic story. There is an obvious sloppiness in the conduct of plots and the use of certain characters in the work, such as the exclusion of Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson) from the final act, with the character being completely unnecessary and underused throughout the production, and also in the way Gorr is used as an antagonist. The script uses the Butcher of the Gods in the worst way that an antagonist can be developed: he is there more to move the plot than to be a counterpoint to the hero, so much so that we rarely see Gorr and Thor have any kind of interesting dialogue with each other. It's a shame, because the god slayer is a conceptually interesting character, far from being Manichaean and Bale, despite some occasional histrionics, is really committed to the role, even giving more dimension and nuanced empathy than he received from the script. There is a sequence that sums up why Gorr doesn't work in the film: when the villain makes that trap to catch the Stormbreaker, Waititi's direction is very efficient in creating a macabre atmosphere at the character's entrance, accompanied by wonderful monochromatic photography, a soundtrack sinister and a Bale committed to the character's psychopathy, and then Thor makes a joke about a dentist. It's so anticlimactic, it completely breaks the construction of the scene and, worse, it takes Gorr's threat off the table.Just like all the scenes with the villain, we never feel any real threat coming from the villain, disappointing everyone who follows the character in the comics, to the detriment of the absurd need to try to insert jokes every five minutes into the script. There is no weight in the threat of the villain, nor in the dramas (see how much drama could have been extracted from the plot involving terminal cancer). All of this is broken with a joke, not always as well inserted as in ""Ragnarok"". This time, the jokes seem to be inserted in an inorganic and forced way, it is as if ""Ragnarok"", praised by many, was written again with much more exaggerations in all aspects, especially in narrative convenience and humor, which this time does not work so well. You see: the joke with the goats screaming is funny the first and second time, but it gets diluted when done for the thousandth time. It's as if the script doesn't know when to stop and loses control as the plot progresses.""Thor: Love and Thunder"" will receive a lot of criticism because of the humor, but the comedy is not a problem as a proposal. The potential of the work is, in fact, very high, and could have been an even more insane version of what we saw in ""Ragnarok"" . The criticism lies in the lack of creativity of Taika Waititi, and also of co-screenwriter Jennifer Kaytin Robinson, in the narrative construction and cinematic approach. Waititi even gave interviews saying that the film was the craziest he had ever made and that he didn't it shouldn't have even been made. Where was all this madness? The action scenes are mostly generic, like the sequences on the streets of New Asgard and in the center of the gods, where the heroes defeat faceless armies, or the clashes with the Gorr himself that doesn't have any inventive choreography beyond the clash of weapons. There are some interesting visual ideas, like Mjolnir shattering, the Thors fighting together, the army of children taken from the best children's films, and, of course, all the block in Dimension of Shadows, but these are sparse moments and which, honestly, seem more like a merit of the technical team than staging ideas or any minimally memorable set-piece from the direction. It is, in fact, a creative and noteworthy film in terms of production design, but the impression given is that the director and screenwriter was working with a lot of freedom due to the prestige achieved previously, and does this work on autopilot to offer some kind of brand or expressiveness that we saw in his previous productions. After the film's release, Waititi said that he only made the Thor films for the money and that he had never read any Thor comics as a child before making the first film. Perhaps this explains the feeling of sloppiness when we see this production.Regarding the story itself, ""Thor: Love and Thunder"" does not innovate and follows the studio's usual structure and formula. However, there is one plot point that proves to be useless and irrelevant to the overall narrative, being merely a marketing strategy to sell the upcoming film. The main objective of the protagonists is not fulfilled in this deviation and something that was supposed to be essential ends up becoming a kind of MacGuffin in the third act. The action set piece is easily forgettable and Russell Crowe's interpretation becomes an unbearable caricature, using an accent so absurd that it ends up removing all seriousness from his character, damaging an eventual powerful presence in future works. Finally, the action of ""Thor: Love and Thunder"" meets the minimum requirements. The black and white sequence takes the trophy, the first act with the ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" brings good levels of entertainment, but everything involving generic CGI monsters born from shadows... I understand the intention of trying to save time and money with ""remains"" of visual effects, hiding the imperfections in the darkness of the night - a well-known workaround - but, unfortunately, most of these scenes become a sometimes-incomprehensible mix of CGI, where it becomes difficult to understand what is really happening.Despite all the problems, the film has its funny moments, like the screaming goats and Jane looking for a catchphrase, and there are several interesting themes regarding mortality, fatherhood, romance and purpose that fill the dramatic arc of a character who becomes made him truly curious behind the jokes. The script is smart in subverting some things, from Gorr's dilemma, the sacrifice of Mighty Thor and a truly beautiful and cute ending with the protagonist becoming a big daddy. In the end, phase 4 is heading towards being the least connected phase between MCU productions, whether in theaters or on Disney Plus, where at this moment the focus is on leaving the darker and mystical side of ""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness "" aside to focus on the more colorful, playful and flashy side of ""Thor: Love and Thunder"".",Helpful,•,0,0,fernandoschiavi,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur33162918/?ref_=tturv_usr_29_t,7-Jan-24,

Now, yeah, V has kinda grown on me over the years and it's definitely no longer the worst one. But still, Thor: Love and Thunder is helluva lot better.In a rare occurrence, the Thor quadrilogy joins both the Spider-Man Home Movies and the Mission: Impossible franchise as the few series that gets progressively better with each chapter. About half-way through this, I thought I liked Ragnarok more. That all changed in the highly enjoyable final act.Thor is BACK, baby. Well, from his Dad-Bod ways and as he's helping out the happy underdogs across the universe, he discovers both Love and Thunderous rage from a God-Butcher. Pray Thor makes it out of this one.The funny thing about this movie that reunites Chris Hemsworth with Natalie Portman: I wasn't 100% looking forward to that reunion prior to starting this adventure-comedy. Truthfully, she is NOT one of my favorite actresses and I'll get right to the point: She practically steals Thor's Thunder throughout this film. She was spectacular and my favorite part of this movie. And this may be my favorite role for her.Now, that said, I thoroughly enjoyed Chris Hemsworth - he was having a ball and it shows he really enjoys entertaining the masses as the title character. The rest of the cast was equally awesome, except, well, The Bland-Batman.I mean, Christian Bale as the Baddie. He was fine, but really uneven. He almost acted like the Joker/Riddler at some moments and then menacingly quiet and composed the next. And back and forth he went. Unfortunately, he was never likable enough to gain ANY sympathy from me - even though his character had well-defined motivation and depth.While this had a KILLER soundtrack, was absolutely hilarious and is technically better than Ragnarok, it's not by much and it's a perfect companion to that third one. Needless to say, if you loved Ragnarok, this will have the same impact for you. And you might as well forget those first two Thors.

To make it worse, this broad, silly humor does battle against serious issues like cancer and child death.Parts of the movie work, like a child-army action scene in the last section, but attempting to make a movie that is as exciting as Black Panther, as funny as Blazing Saddles, and as touching as A Star is Born was doomed to fail.Director Waititi managed to pull off impressive tonal shifts in Jojo Rabbit so perhaps he thought he was up to creating this Turducken. But there was serious intent behind that movie and this is just a popcorn flick with an everything-but-the-kitchen-sink approach.Still, it's got some good action, Natalie Portman manages to pull off the combo of pathos and badassery Waititi so desperately wanted, Russell Crowe is genuinely funny (who knew), and if you like superhero movies you might as well go ahead and watch it.

The story does have a heart but it is buried beneath all the vapid goofiness that's overdone to the point of annoyance.Co-written & directed by Taika Waititi (Hunt for the Wilderpeople & Jojo Rabbit), Thor: Love and Thunder isn't devoid of the flavours that made its predecessor work but the balance is certainly missing this time around. The film looks & feels like its own parody, for Waititi here overdoses on his own style and fails to properly handle the drama, romance & comedy elements. The premise is promising but when it comes to execution, it is lacking in restraint & consistency.For a $250 million production, the imagery & visual effects look as underdeveloped as they are uninspiring. Editing focuses on all the wrong stuff here as the film could've done more with less Korg, less eccentricity, less quips and certainly more emphasis on developing the dramatic bits. Every now n then, it does strike a heartfelt chord but with the narrative being a tonal nightmare, the effectiveness of those moments is either vastly diminished or wholly nullified by the silliness on display.Overall, Thor: Love and Thunder isn't entirely the disaster that many are calling it to be but it is definitely a step down in quality & coherence that the last chapter exuded in spades. The story isn't without its merits but they are few n far between. Enormously underwhelming & downright forgettable, the film showcases Taika Waititi's worst tendencies as a storyteller, certainly ranks amongst his weakest directorial efforts, and suffers from problems of its own makings.

As Thor comes to Sif's aid he learns someone known as Gorr The God Butcher (Christian Bale) has been murdering the various Gods throughout the universe using the Necrosword and now has his sights set on New Asgard on Earth. Once there Thor fends off Gorr's shadow monsters alongside New Asgard leader Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson) and is met by surprise when he learns Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) now wields Mjolnir which unbeknownst to Thor was a last resort by Jane to stave off her aggressive cancer. When Gorr manages to abduct the Asgardian children, Thor, Jane, Valkyrie, and Korg team up and set out to find help from the other Gods and stop Gorr's rampage.Shortly after the enthusiastic reeception and box office success of Thor: Ragnarok, Taika Waititi and Marvel executives reunited on a greenlit fourth Thor movie. Many of the cast were interested in returning including star Chris Hemsworth who credited Waititi with revitalizing the character after initially growing exhausted with the role. From a business standpoint it just makes sense to give Waititi another go at Thor given that Ragnarok was the highest grossing and best reviewed film in the series, but while Ragnarok struck the balance between its humor and taking its story reasonably seriously, Love and Thunder stumbles hard with its tone often feeling at odds with its thematic material.If there's one thing I think many people will agree on, it's in Christian Bale's performance as Gorr The God Butcher in that it's probably the best villain we've seen for a standalone Thor movie yet (keep in mind Loki didn't go full force until the first Avengers film). The opening sequence where we're introduced to Gorr traversing a desolate wasteland with his daughter who dies of starvation and thirst in his arms only for Gorr himself to find the God he worshipped is indifferent to his suffering makes him a sympathetic villain and his transformation through the usage of the Necrosword makes him an intimidating villain with a lot of depth. In many ways it reminded me of a better version of villains like Ronan the Accuser or Malekith who had very similar motivations but were paper thin in comparison to Gorr.Unfortunately, that's where we have to transition to the weak points of the movie, of which there are many. Right out of the gate the movie has an abrupt tonal shift from the ending of the scene where we see Gorr's corruption to a montage sequence where Taika Waititi's Korg narrates a heavily abridged version of Thor's life glibly discussing character deaths in a rather offhanded way which transitions to Thor still with the Guardians of the Galaxy who are really only an extended cameo. Despite the lingering threat of Gorr the movie overplays its comedy to an obnoxious degree with Korg now having warn out his goodwill from his restrained usage in Ragnarok to terribly running gags about a pair of screaming goats Thor uses as transport who aren't funny and just annoying. Jane Foster is given a richer role than previous incarnations as she's not only taken on a separate mantle as Thor but is battling cancer but rather than explore Jane and Thor's relationship regarding either of those two points, the movie thinks it'd be more interesting to see yet another terrible running gag of Thor's weapons acting like his ex-girlfriend and currently girlfriend with Stormbreak now jealous of Thor's hangups with Mjolnir now loyal to Jane in what's less a running gag and more a limping gag. The sad thing is, if you look at the nuts and bolts of the story it's pretty solid. The main problem that takes the movie down is in the fact is afraid to let our characters have any stretch of pathos that isn't interrupted by a stupid joke. But there are at least a few scenes that hit emotional resonance such as the ending.Thor: Love and Thunder has all the right elements and a really good villain and performance from Christian Bale, but the overly jokey tone makes Love and Thunder very much the Yin to Ragnarok's Yang. With that said: I don't think this is a worse movie than Thor: The Dark World because I will remember Love and Thunder (both good points and bad) but I still struggle to remember The Dark World. It has some issues that weigh it down to being the weakest Thor movie alongside The Dark World but both movies aren't great just for different reasons.",Helpful,•,0,0,IonicBreezeMachine,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur117926588/?ref_=tturv_usr_56_t,23-Apr-23,

Yes, I'd like this film to be remade please, without all of the nonsense and with Chris Hemsworth's real bottom. I mean who tuned in to see a CGI version? Surely it's a thing of beauty in its own right?Lose the stupid goat noises and the odd ""quirky"" jokes that were just for the sake of it and really focus on the fantastic story that this could have been.It even started daft. They took his recklessness too far and it certainly didn't seem like the comic book version of Thor that I was used to from his appearances in the X-Men collection.I liked the use of Korg narrating things throughout, but that was enough humour.The jokes in 'Thor: Ragnarok' (2017) worked because they weren't every two seconds and were appropriate to the storyline, but they seemed to have saturated this script or probably ad-libbed the dialogue in some sort of attempt to outdo the laughs of that previous instalment, which has ultimately ruined the whole thing and put me right off of Thor as a character. I realised recently that actually Liam Hemsworth is probably the better of the brothers having seen him in 'The Dressmaker' (2015), but watching this film definitely put me off his brother Chris, because he obviously agreed to take his greatest character in this ridiculous direction.I think that Chris and Taika Waititi need to part ways now before they ruin the franchise completely. The 'Guardians Of The Galaxy' (2014) part at the beginning was quite clearly to explain away the fact that the ""Asgardians Of The Galaxy' film was never made and they had to show how Thor had moved on since leaving with them in 'Avengers: Endgame' (2019).Unfortunately it got too stupid and was far too busy with new and existing characters.And I am really very angry about this, because, as I've said, the story was such a great concept. Bringing back the gorgeous and talented Natalie Portman as Jane Foster+ and facing them off against 'Gorr The God Butcher', played superbly by Christian Bale, were class ideas.If this had been produced and directed in the same way that the other Marvel films had been, then I believe that it could have been one of the best stories in the series, but what they actually achieved (If you can call it an achievement) was a conglomeration of a kids adventure film, a bittersweet romance and a comedic farce all rolled into one. It really lost its way.I feel as I did with 'The Eternals' (2021) and 'Shang Chi' (2021), that this film was rushed out to keep the Marvel momentum going, but didn't have the thought or consideration put in to ensure it was worthy of the franchise. It was missing that final proof read and edit and it showed.I'm actually glad that my mother fell over and I had to take her to hospital on the night that I was supposed to see this film, because I'd be furious if I'd paid to see it.460.72/1000.",Helpful,•,1,4,adamjohns-42575,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur116970440/?ref_=tturv_usr_59_t,6-Oct-22,

Then the story uses a juvenile-level narrative flashbacks and adds a romantic dimension along with the threatening menace which by the end of the movie becomes like Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness a strong redeeming climax that helps to greatly lift the overall assessment of the movie. For those unfamiliar with these characters, a number of well-known actors offer up some surprising, disguised performances, perhaps credit to their acting abilities and make-up, except for surprise appearance of Matt Damon (uncredited) whose presence is almost always impossible to disguise. In sum, Thor is an enjoyable, summer romp that does not break any new ground, but Chris Hemsworth makes great use of his light, comedic lines. Mostly tame, off-beat almost overly cute humor along with the typical fantasy action sequences describe this movie, but it is the relational moments that shine.",Helpful,•,4,14,tabuno,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0972645/?ref_=tturv_usr_60_t,23-Jul-22,

It is certainly going for laughs more than anything else. Consequently the tone is very safe and no one ever feels like they are in much genuine danger.

Look, I do appreciate what you guys have done with Thor or Dr. Jane Foster, or even with Valkyrie, but what you have done to Gorr is inexcusable, I will not forgive.Moreover, I saw many others had conveyed their disapproval regarding the tonality of the film which did lean more towards a lighter, less gritty route and I too happen to have the same complaint.

This one also pulled my interest with the villain being Gorr and played by Christian Bale. This one I watched with Jaime as there are certain superhero films she will still watch.For this movie here, we are first introduced to Gorr as he is given the Necro Sword that allows him to kill gods. He goes about this hunt after dedicating his life to one that turned his back on him.Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is still hanging out with the Guardians of the Galaxy. They split ways here as Thor learns of Gorr, who is known as 'The God Butcher'. This pulls Thor to Earth. He goes to New Asgard where King Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson) is in power still. Korg (Taika Waititi) joins him.There is a wrinkle here that I picked up on from the subtitle, Love and Thunder. Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) has cancer. She is slowly dying and it feels like she is giving up the fight. Darcy (Kat Dennings) wants her to reach out to Thor, but things didn't end well and there is unresolved feelings.The two of them run into each other when Mjöllnir calls out to Jane. Thor has a big surprise from this as well. He might be a bit jealous. Thor enlists the aid of those that will join him to defeat this new threat that is killing gods and there are none that can escape his wrath.Now that I've recapped this movie, I did want to say that this another solid installment. What I noticed here is that this one is another dark take while also being whimsical. Jaime wasn't even entirely sure if she liked this one as it seems to be more comedy than others. I was looking for the best way to put this since The Dark World and Ragnarök also have dark elements too. This seems to be a thing with Thor movies. I should say that I like the comedy aspects as it made me laugh.Then back to the darker elements. Gorr is a great villain. I'm not familiar with the comics so I don't know about him as a villain. It is interesting since he uses a weapon called the Necro Sword that would be right out of video games I've played like Final Fantasy. I like that aspect. It also brings interesting powers. Gorr also kidnaps children. I never feel like they're truly in peril. I still like it.I'll then go over to the acting. Hemsworth is great as Thor. I like that this movie makes him a bit more human which is good. Bringing back Portman is good too. There is good heart and emotion there. I like Bale as the villain. He fits that role well. Thompson and Waititi are solid in their supporting roles. They're both great with the comedy. We also have cameos by Russell Crowe, Jaimie Alexander, Idris Elba, Chris Pratt, Dave Bautista, Karen Gillan, Sean Gunn, Dennings, Stellan Skarsgård, Luke Hemsworth, Matt Damon, Sam Neill, Melissa McCarthy and Ben Falcone. We also get the voices of Vin Diesel and Bradley Cooper as well.All that is left to go into would be with the filmmaking. This has good cinematography. There is good contrast between the place of the gods to the desert we first see Gorr and then even going to the shadow realm. There is a lot of CGI, but I come to expect that. This has Disney money so it looks good. We also get a heavy dose of Guns-n-Roses which I wasn't expecting with the soundtrack. This is worth a watch and one of the better movies during the Marvel Cinematic Universe for Phase 4.My Rating: 7 out of 10.",Helpful,•,0,3,Reviews_of_the_Dead,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur23318905/?ref_=tturv_usr_64_t,1-Mar-23,
6,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8311990/?ref_=tturv_perm_65,"Funny as hell, but not as good as the first 3 Thor Films","'Thor: Love and Thunder"" is, like most of the Marvel films since Iron Man died, only intermittently amusing, a bit wobbly in its storytelling, thin in its emotional impact and more geared toward spectacle than coherence. Thor's latest planet-skipping adventures are built around the party-rock atmosphere of several Guns N' Roses tracks, notably ""Sweet Child o' Mine,"" but, alas, the song's refrain ""Where do we go? Where do we go now? Where do we go?"" is all too apt for the movie's directionless, make-it up as we go along style. Here are a lot of things I love about Waititi's approach to Thor, but my favorite is that they are now comedies. While ""Ragnarok"" was packed with jokes, I think ""Love and Thunder"" embraces the comedy aspect even more. The trailers let us know there would be plenty of laughs, but it also felt like it may try to be a bit more serious. Well, thankfully, that was the trailer, not the movie. ""Love and Thunder"" is listed as an action, adventure and comedy. What it actually is, is a comedy with some action and adventure. I laughed out loud so many times and just when you start feeling like things are getting serious, you get a perfectly timed gag and the tension is released. Often times when a movie is trying to be funny or full of action, the filmmakers tend to sacrifice story and emotion for spectacle. This is not the case with ""Love and Thunder."" Waititi understands in order to make the jokes land and the action hit, you have to care about what is happening. I don't want to give anything away, so I'll be vague here, but there is a rich story filled with love, wanting, loneliness, heartache and sorrow. These heavier elements create a story we're invested in as an audience, but it's balanced expertly with humor, adventure and plenty of spectacle. I cared about Thor, Jane and even Christian Bale's Gorr. Waititi and his team created relatable characters, strong storylines and plenty of drama. We've had a few opportunities to see this, but Hemsworth is a brilliant comedic actor. His timing and delivery are pitch-perfect and make for an egocentric Thor with a heart of gold, and you can't help but love him. Hemsworth was the perfect choice for this role and it's ever more evidenced in ""Love and Thunder."" We all know Natalie Portman is a fine actress, but her chemistry with Hemsworth is palpable and she brings a certain sense of humanity to the film that is essential to its success.",Helpful,•,4,5,moviesfilmsreviewsinc,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur59184301/?ref_=tturv_usr_65_t,8-Jul-22,

I always expect these marvel movies to get better and better to the point that they put the movie before it to shame. Still, this sequel to the Thor branch of the Marvel cinematic universe franchise did not exceed expectations. It had action, adventure, and humor, which I was expecting from Taika Waititi, who also directed Ragnarok, and that was great. Still, in Love and Thunder, the humor outshined the action-adventure. Not necessarily entirely a bad thing because the humor was so on point. Never did I feel a joke was dropped that did not deliver the laughs it expected, but I do feel these laughs came at the price of the action-adventure, which was lacking. The visuals in the movie were epic. Waititi knows how to film a sci-fi Fantasy, especially one that pays homage to the 1980s (although the constant use of Gun and Roses songs was not as spectacular as using Immrgant song by Led Zepplin twice in Ragnarok). As the movie progressed, the visuals got better and better to the point where a complete introduction of a marvel comics character making his first full appearance in the cinematic universe was breathtaking. Waititi was working that camera. The performances from the whole cast were good. I could go on about how great Chris Hemsworth is as Thor and his fantastic chemistry with Tessa Thompson as Valkyrie but what impressed me was Natalie Portman's return as Jane Foster (AKA Thor). I was not expecting much from the actress who seemed bitterly glad to end her ties with the franchise, but from the moment she appeared on the screen, she was dynamite in my book. I love every minute of her. Also, Russel Crowe's run as Zeus was enjoyable. It solidified everything this movie was about, and you can tell he enjoyed his role. Well done! Overall, Thor: love & Thunder was laid out like a comic book. As easily as I sat in the theatre watching, was easy as if I had sat in my living room reading it.

Granted, he's spent the past however-long running around the cosmos with his new friends in the Guardians of the Galaxy, righting wrongs and soaking up the adulation, so it's not like he's completely listless. He just wonders if, maybe, there mightn't be more to life as a living thunder god than cheap thrills and easy wins. That's where the villainous ""God Butcher"" Gorr comes into play. Having violently ended a great number of minor deities already, his vengeful blade now points squarely at New Asgard. Where, coincidentally, Thor's old flame Jane Foster has just taken up a form of godhood.Following hot on the heels of 2017's Ragnarok, the '22 model brings the whole band back together again with a few additional boons. Stunning visual effects, epic fantasy landscapes, belly-quaking rock'n'roll tracks, an irreverent sense of humor (trademark of returning writer/director Taika Waititi) and a decidedly loose connection to the greater MCU... yeah, this wants to be a successor to Ragnarok, all right. Shame, then, that it's just a high-profile case study for the law of diminishing returns.Without exception, every single component that so felt effortless and precise in the previous film is weaker and broader in Love and Thunder. Where the last entry was delightfully quirky and witty, this one feels forced and excessive. Where I was ready to stand up and cheer at the opening chords of Led Zeppelin's ""Immigrant Song,"" the similarly climactic placement of ""November Rain,"" either the third or fourth Guns n' Roses tune on the soundtrack, made my eyes roll. The ambitious visuals have taken a step down, the cast has lost its edge, and the story, though excessively simple, still under-delivers. Christian Bale is completely wasted as Gorr, acting his heart out in portrayal of yet another villainous afterthought whose sporadic barks are far worse than his bite. Natalie Portman is awkward and flavorless as an ex-lover turned rival; Thor seems more upset about being ditched by his semi-sentient war hammer. Even MCU heavyweights Chris Pratt and Chris Hemsworth have had far better showings, mutually saddled by a bland script.Love and Thunder has bits and pieces that work - a handful of laughs, a few visual nods to the source material - but those are light and fleeting enough to have fit into an ambitious short film.

[+60%],"The movie is, by all means, a two and ½ stars but an extra ½ goes to Christian Bale who puts his heart, soul, and body into an underwritten character. With confusing character arcs, a good chunk of humor not quite hitting the highs you expect, and the lack of stakes, Taika Waititi's second Thor flick severely lacks the liveliness of Ragnarok. The GOTG cameos don't mean anything, and the entire scene with Russell Crowe's Zeus simply makes for a subpar comedy sketch. Heck, I'm sure Sam Neill, Matt Damon, and the Asgardian performers could've come up with something much better.The MCU continues to struggle with its inability to write off characters even when they're dead, and it's the case with Love and Thunder too. Jane Foster, her sudden cancer, and her mysterious connection to Mjolnir all remain underdeveloped aspects in the film. There is a constant back-and-forth when it comes to tone, and somewhere between humor, drama, and darkness, my interest levels waned. What keeps it engaging, however, is Waititi's visual craft. He creates both a colorful and a colorless world within the same film, and the GnR tracks are perfectly placed.",Helpful,•,1,2,arungeorge13,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur30872044/?ref_=tturv_usr_84_t,8-Sep-22,
10,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9333654/?ref_=tturv_perm_85,"Finally saw this, it's WAY not bad","Taika is great, especially as the dude made out of rock, if not a very funny and talented Director and actor.I particularly welcomed the return of Jane Foster, and I was a little bit surprised at the way that they brought her back. I distinctly remember Mjollnir being back in the possession of Thor and Captain America after Thor stole it from the Dark World timeline... of course, the Asgardians could have scooped up the pieces left over from Ragnarok, but where is that other hammer from Avengers endgame? Maybe it is not really a plot hole, I don't remember where that other Mjollnir got to. Did Steve Rogers return it?And then it is always great to have the Guardians of the Galaxy involved, this was before Guardians of the Galaxy Vol3 and Nebula's transformation into one of Tony Starks Nanotech projects. I honestly liked her before when she was still partly RadioShack shelf rejects.And compared to Ragnarok, although there is a lot of humor in this film, it does have some serious drama.But there are a number of absurd complaints I've read in several dupe ""reviews"". Let's go over these, shall we?1) It's FUNNY.To not like a movie because it is FUNNY? That is the main complaint that I am reading, oh, this is no good because it is FUNNY. Wait, what?There are some new gimmicks in this film, nothing was wasted. And so Thor assembles a new means of transportation through by Bifrost. Out of... Watch the movie to find out what it is made out of. But it's funny!2) NepotismI also read a number of complaints regarding ""nepotism"", wait, what! That's a big so what! I don't care who plays what or who, or if they are the son or daughter of some cast or crew member. Yawn. And honestly, I did not know when I was watching the film.Christian Bale almost reprises his role as the American Psycho. - at first, we believe that this person is irredeemable. But in a major, unexpected twist, well, you will have to watch the film in order to see what I'm talking about.The film starts getting very serious toward the middle, of course it kind of slightly bothers me that Thor is still a little bit goofy after the events of avengers endgame. But then again, this is also within his character. He was handed a major loss in endgame, and this was his reaction. So, as far as I'm concerned, he is dealing with that loss, which changed him irrevocably.This is a much different Thor than the person that we met in the first film. And The Avengers. That serious person... Which is totally expected after all the character has gone through.And these changes were just for films, the comic book numbered in the hundreds, and the character was always ever-changing, even then.Remember when Thor resided within a geek that had to yell ""ODIN"" at a hammer which would then turn him into Thor? The character has changed a lot over the course of maybe 40 or 50 years. And then some of his power was siphoned off into another character named Bloodaxe, which was a spinoff title that only lasted a couple of dozen issues- it was related to West Coast Avengers, which then became Force Works.It's kind of like how the Hulk was always dumb and residing within Bruce Banner. And hulk has gone through a lot of changes. There was a time he was dumb when he was human, but smart when he was ""The Gray Hulk""- but back then he went by ""Mr. Fixit"", he accompanied Wolverine in a few issues. Anybody remember The Hulk versus Thor? It is now called ""the return of the Incredible Hulk""- at the time when it was originally broadcast, it was called the Hulk versus Thor, or probably simply Hulk vs Thor. And some of the dialogue from that TV movie found its way into the first Thor film.3) CGI?Another complaint was with the amount of CGI, which you can barely tell these days. And this complaint is made by people who don't realize that there are still a lot of practical effects and real, physical locations and objects, even in this film. I'm getting really tired of that old complaint. If we have the ability to make realistic, digital set extensions, then we should use them always. But even with a lot of digital set extensions, a lot of the detail is real physical props, and other real artwork.I like that this movie focuses a lot on the Asgardian children, and it shows their true potential- including the son of Heimdall.I like that this film pulls back from the inanity of Ragnarok, although this film includes some of that silliness.I thought Ragnarok was way over the top, but I did enjoy it. But this film has that same over the top feel at least at the beginning, but it also is balanced with some heartbreaking things.The final complaint and I see this a lot is about ""the writing""I want to ask the people who wrote those reviews, have you ever written for television? Have you ever written for Broadway or the theater?You can't just sit down and spew unplanned stream of conscious, everything has to be planned out and mapped out, especially with television.And it's even more difficult with a film.And so the question I finally have is: are these reviews taking an extremely long time to post? Because I don't believe I have put anything into these reviews that are anything near as bad as what I have read recently.",Helpful,•,5,7,XweAponX,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2366174/?ref_=tturv_usr_85_t,21-Sep-23,

9,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8310748/?ref_=tturv_perm_88,Unlike Anything That MCU Has Shown Us Before; Matched With A Rocking Soundtrack,"Marvel Studio's Thor: Love and Thunder officially redefines the definition of film and on-screen art. Taika Waititi's background as a painter can be seen throughout the film, through the use of a vibrant color scheme and specific tint isolation. This is incredibly aesthetically pleasing and, quite frankly, nothing that the Marvel Cinematic Universe has shown us before. Matched with a rocking soundtrack -- Appetite for Destruction from Guns N' Roses, Thor: Love and Thunder is quite literally an ""appetite for destruction.""Thor: Love and Thunder picks up after the events of Avengers: Endgame. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is still tagging along as one of the Guardians of the Galaxy. After all his paths have been severed from his battles with Thanos, he finds himself without a pathway. In all of his thousands of years of living, this has never been a concept that Thor has had to tackle. This puts him on a journey of self-exploration. Although, obviously in the Marvel Universe, that can only last so long when the new villain Gorr the God Butcher (Christian Bale) comes to town. Gorr vows that ""all gods will die."" Thor recruits the help of his ex-girlfriend Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) who seemingly became a Thor herself. These two learn to work together to defeat Gorr and how to navigate the world while rekindling their old relationship.Thor: Love and Thunder emphasizes the idea of ""love"" in the title because that's how audiences will feel about the film's color variations and banging soundtrack. Christian Bale completely steals the entire show as Gorr the God Butcher. In every scene he is in, your eyes are glued to his worldly-like presence on the screen. Although he is terrifying, the audience will not be able to get enough of him. Christian Bale finds a way to make this a Christian Bale film and not a Chris Hemsworth film. As much as Gorr the God Butcher's storyline is golden, which is ironic given his black and white color scheme, other branches of the film feel unnecessary. During the film, certain plot points are used that feel somewhat like a cheap excuse to move the story forward. The characters spend a solid 30 minutes exploring something new, yet later we learn that it has no overall impact or relevance to the story. Part of the film is wasted on the focus of Zeus. It may be comedic and light-hearted in the moment, yet it almost feels like it is only introduced to help set up future Marvel projects, rather than focus on the film we are currently watching.If the title doesn't make it obvious, the film deals with the theme of love persevering and expresses the concept that relationships aren't forever, but the love behind them is eternal. Following previous Marvel content Thor: Love and Thunder continues the trend of pushing PG-13 boundaries and getting darker. When I say that Christian Bale is incredibly terrifying, that is really true. Marvel does not hold back on his character, especially when a large part of his role is about abducting children. Given that, plus the barrel of intense action throughout the film, this film is not to be taken lightly.I give Thor: Love and Thunder 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, plus adults.

The catch here is that the movie is very comedy oriented, giving it a cartoonish tone and it feels like a parody of Thor. Russell Crowe's Zeus character is too cartoonish and ends up contributing very little. Chris Hemsworth is still the best as Thor and Natalie Portman now has more participation. The relationship between Thor and Jane Foster brings this movie to life more than the first 2 installments and there is more chemistry between them. Christian Bale in the role of Gorr is an extraordinary villain, quite dark and with a good story that justifies his actions. Another exciting thing about the movie is the soundtrack, which includes Guns N' Roses songs that offer a really exciting moment.

It was funny at random moments with a few unexpected celebrity cameo appearances, but the constantly comic approach was maintained at the expense of the convoluted Asgardian adventure storyline. It also meant sacrificing the heart that would have us empathize with the fate of the principal characters. Chris Hemsworth still plays the title role in the manner born - though the rest of the cast felt somewhat less committed to their roles, even Christian Bale as the malevolent evildoer and Natalie Portman returning in superhero form as Thor's love interest.

It was great to see Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) play a hero figure who was equal to Thor but with a sad twist. It was the most serious film in the Thor film series with Jane having cancer and the death of the villain's daughter at the start of the film. I felt they could added a bit more humour, used the Guardians of the Galaxy more and perhaps Zeus and the gods could have teamed up to fight Gorr.

6,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8324735/?ref_=tturv_perm_94,It's fun but too much stupid attempts at comedy big it down and stop it from really hitting its stride!,"Yeah too much of everything kind of, like for example the screaming giant space goats, it would have been funny as a one-off joke but it's something that pops up throughout the whole movie! And this movie really assumes you must love Korg a whole lot because he has not one but three patronising narrations that open and close the movie and bring you up to date with what happened between here and Endgame, and I didn't like those scenes very much as they just didn't do it for me and felt like a lazy attempt to condense the story and get it moving faster, one would have worked at the beginning of the movie but it's overdone, and so is Korg grossly, I thought he worked much better in Ragnarok because he and the schtick approach was new and was done much better and just enough for it to not be to obnoxious in that movie, but here I felt sick of him within moments and he way overstayed his welcome and was just annoying as fk!! Urg it's like the movie was made for severely attention deficit people who can't sit still and take in a movie for like two minutes, it was terrified of slowing down even just a little and just letting the story breathe for a while, the rapid fire jokes were for me having a bad effect on the more serious aspects and the pathos, I thought it clashed horribly when it would go from her as the lady Thor to sick and dying in the hospital, you simply cannot plonk something as deadly serious as freaking cancer in a movie like this and expect it to work, it's like having Billy get a brain tumour in Gremlins 2! It felt like there was a really good movie in there somewhere, just between Thor Jane and Gorr but it didn't focus on that enough, I really didn't think Natalie Portman and Chris Hemsworth has any chemistry at all in the original movie but here I thought the opposite, they're a little older and things have changed a lot since that picture and she seemed more relaxed than before and I liked her as a warrior woman I thought it was cool, I was surprised by how she ended up at the end I thought it was surprisingly sad, don't worry about her coming back in any sequels folks! Christian Bale was surprisingly awesome and very creepy as the villain, I thought he came off as genuinely insane and lethal, I wanted more of him, he was probably the most threatening villain in a marvel movie yet. I also loved how his story ended as well, never expected to see one of the biggest cosmic entities of the Marvel universe in one of the movies, kudos to Taika for not having Eternity crack some goofy joke, although I'm sure it was severely tempting! There was definitely some awesome things in it, I loved the visuals and some of the huge locations, and the hall of the gods and the silly Zeus was where I thought the comedy did work really well and I liked that scene a lot with Thor declaring the gods cowardly and ticking off the most lazy Zeus ever, look forward to see where that leads in the future. I was overall slightly disappointed with this, it took what worked for Ragnarok and cranks it up to eleven and for some that might work but for me the comedy was mostly just annoying and obnoxious, frequently stopped the movie dead and prevented it from really ever taking off in a big way, this overstuffed cosmic mess of a film proves that Mr Waititi is capable of overestimating his strengths as a director and also that he could really do with learning a little restraint!

8,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8313715/?ref_=tturv_perm_96,You might Love the Comedy And Action This Thunder Brings,"LIKES:The Pacing At Times: Thor Love and Thunder once more puts us back into the fast paced seat of Marvel and keeps the foot on the pedal the entire time. Like Ragnarök before it, the fourth installment has the same energy and pizazz that Waititi brought us in the past and that makes for an energetic pace. It does not take long to get into the adventure element and he keeps things moving as fast as he can to keep you the viewer into the madness this particular film has to bring. He has brought other elements into the mix to help bring others in, but the pace is certain to be perfect for those with flash in the pan likes of the cinematic world.The Balance of Characters: Marvel has become accustomed to putting a lot into their phase 4 movies, with the last three films juggling a lot of characters and fan service into one installment. Thor's fourth installment has a lot of characters to play with and keep on the screen at one time and it does it surprisingly well, and perhaps the second best of the Phase 4 stuff to date in terms of this element. The Guardians have their fair share of time without being too stuck on the movie, while Thor's merry band of godly misfits each get their own time to shine on the screen and feel significant in some way. Our leading bad guy Gorr has meaningful moments in this film and feels like a well-developed character, while the other plot elements of the film get their own time and good use. It's a fantastic surprise to see how many people had their shining moments and a nod to Waititi for finding a way to juggle it.The Sound Track: Like Guardians, this movie may have one of my favorite track lists to watch a movie too. All the classic songs and epic energy is waiting to swallow you whole with the crazy vibes and perfect timing for inclusion in this movie. Odd love ballads are there during the calmer and more intimate moments, while the action packed moments once more pull from the legendary decades of rock and roll. It feels just like Ragnarök's execution on many levels, and for me was better at times with dropping the right song at the right time and kicking major butt with it. Even the orchestral work finds a place to shine, and the unique tracks for it, and unique spins, show that Waititi is just as ridiculously fun as he always has been.The Visual Direction/Sound Editing: With the budge and resources of Disney, big visuals are the expected norm at this point. While I can't say this is the most mind blowing use of their technology, I do have to clap my hands and nod at the worlds they created for this film. Thor's adventure takes a lot of new styles to heart in their quest, starting technicolor and trippy from the get go that we have seen in Guardians and then moving into something much deeper. The group managed to do so much with the use of lighting in this film, most of the time using it perfectly to really give the aura of the worlds they were trying to create. As seen in the trailer, there is an homage to the black and white film technique that I loved, and heading to the divine city of the Gods really felt like something out of a Percy Jackson chapter in the books. It's beautiful and the sound editing that goes with most of these scenes fully brings that extra emotional punch with it, be it robbing the scene of sound, or adding the sheen and heavenly shine of the kingdom of the gods.The Emotional Moments Of The Movie: Many of the Marvel movies have not really hit me with the emotional punch like other fans have. Spiderman has come the closest, and there are a scant few times of a few other things to get me to nearly form tears. This one though has the most emotional moments for me in a very, very long time. I can't say much, but the character development of Thor is really good in this film, and addresses a few things that movies like this tend to shy away from for the fantasy elements. You'll find yourself potentially in a relevant case for Gorr, Thor, Jane, and Valkyrie's trials and really feel the connection they were going for in their representation on screen. Again, I want to say more, but I can't for spoilers so let's keep going.The Comedy at times: Waititi proved you can have a lot of comedic fun with Thor and still have the Marvel element. For this film, he did that very well on many levels again, bringing with it some brilliant dialogue and timing that I absolutely laughed at in the film. As Korg, his delivery is just spot on and well narrated, sort of like the Barney Fife of Thor's band, that provides that kick you need to relieve the tension. Thor himself feels like the Asgardian we have known and loved for so long, and it really flows well in this movie to not be a drastic twist.DISLIKES:The Rushed Pace In The Opening: Like Rogue One, Thor's fourth installment has an opening that seems a bit rushed, choppy, and a montage more than anything else. It does the job and gives you enough of the story foundation to enjoy, but yet still seems a bit choppy and montage like that I did not quite enjoy. Much of it had to do with the Guardians inclusion and the Gorr's opening moves, alongside jane's story for why she is coming back to the universe. It's not the worst thing given the amazing acts to follow, but you can't help but wonder how good this film could have been with a little more time in the opening.A Story Element: I can't say much about this element without ruining the story, but another small quip, is why the solution to the problem could not have been used again for the final number. Probably to help out with the emotional punch mentioned earlier, probably another rule that I missed or don't know from the comic book. Regardless, the last part seemed to have a fix we could have used, but again I'll let it mostly slide.The Emotional Moments Can Be Tough: If you have a nightmare or sensitivity to some deeper story elements found in Dramatic movies, this film can be tough for you to watch. A warning more than anything, Thor's fourth tale hits some hard topics that do hit the emotional scale, but may be too realistic or hard to watch in the way they present it. It's realistic and makes sense, but it's also a grounding element that you may not want to see in a super hero movie.Some of The Political Push: Yep, we should not be surprised that Disney is still doing the checkbox checking in their Phase 4 installments. The Love and Thunder has a few moments of showing the political agenda off, some of which are naturally baked in, and others a little more of a push than needed for me. It's not the content more so the timing and placement, and though Waititi accomplishes the taste balance better than others, sometimes it gets away and seems to be a diversion not needed.The Visuals Sometimes Get In the Way Of the Action: If you are a fan like me, you like to get the full scope of the action playing out, like in Avengers or Winter Soldier. Waititi and his crew do this decently well, but there are times where the visual style or camera work gets in the way and feels like a cost saving step. The dark tones, how they are zoomed in and the CGI cramming sometimes don't come out as well as they had hoped for me, as they block the people doing the action. Again, it seems trivial, but with a little more post editing and lighting, I think the action scenes in some parts of the movie would have been awesome.A Little More Action: Yep, the action junkie wants more action, surprised right? It's a trivial moment given the other movies I've seen, but Thor's fight scenes in the middle and the end could have used about five to ten minutes more for me to finish those moments strong. The pillar is again the middle moment on the platform, all I can say again, which felt like it held almost the right amount of involvement and finish. The end scenes came close and still end well, but just a little more time with the music, the style, and the twist involvement would have really made this element perfect for me.The Comedy Gets A Little Excessive: By far my biggest dislike of the movie, was the excessive comedy that this part of the Marvel franchise goes too far for me in. If you want your comedy stuffed into every line, with running gags that keep going, Waititi made this movie for you. For others, there are times where the comedy is in your face, forced, and excessive to the point of losing the funny and going to the annoying part that you hope the element will stop. Sometimes it's the banter and the dialogue trying to shoehorn in, and other times it's some political comedy that just does not need to be in there when there seemed to be other options. My biggest irk of the comedy though was the famous goat yell, and just how excessive it became, only making me laugh a few times when he timed it well. Overall, this was the part that seemed a little too much for me, but for those who like comedy, you'll love it.The VERDICT
Thor's mighty adventure turned out to be better on many levels than I thought and really was the fun adventure the trailers promised. It's a movie with style, pizazz, and that Waititi magic many have fallen in love with, balancing a lot of elements to fantastic amounts in who they recruited for the ordeal. With a great soundtrack, awesome visuals, action that feels early Marvel, and character development, this film really has a lot for the fanbase to revel in and enjoy in the shorter runtime than you would expect. Though it does still have some elements I did not enjoy like a rushed paced story element, a little political moments that could have been tapered down, and excessive comedy at times, the movie really is a fun and good installment for me. This is a film worth the investment to going to the theaters and may be worth the full blown theater experience (Imax etc.) if you got the resources or access to it. Overall, this movie for me gets:Action/Adventure/Comedy: 8.5

If you lower your expectations, you will enjoy it. Yes, jokes are forced and THOR: RAGNAROK seems like comedy gold, a G. O. A. T in comparison. There is a lot of mediocrity here. Maybe this movie targets very young audiences, i mean, if i was 10 years old, i would probably love it. It's too naive and silly.However, there are some positives. As many people have mentioned, Bale is great. Portman is a very good actress too, and she doesn't disappoint. Russel Crow was funnier than i expected. I found these goats very funny too and Korg was a likeable character. Hemsworth is always a charismatic presence. Furthermore, i got used to this movie naiveness and i liked a lot the final ""battle"". Guns n roses were a perfect choice, as a 90's kid, their music always brings me joy. Finally, there were some lines that made me laugh. (Jarnbjorn vs mjolnir, etc).So, lower your expectations, forget previous phases' existence, and you will probably enjoy it.

The film stars Chris Hemsworth as Thor, alongside Natalie Portman, Tessa Thompson, and Christian Bale.Plot
Thor, now a wanderer after the events of ""Avengers: Endgame,"" reunites with the Guardians of the Galaxy. However, their journey is interrupted when Gorr the God Butcher (Bale) begins his quest to kill all gods. Thor is forced to return to Earth and Asgard to confront this new threat, reuniting with old allies and facing new challenges.Characters
Chris Hemsworth continues to deliver a strong performance as Thor, showcasing his heroic nature and emotional depth. Natalie Portman's return as Jane Foster adds a human element to the story, while Tessa Thompson's Valkyrie brings a sense of strength and leadership. Christian Bale's Gorr is a memorable villain, bringing a dark and menacing presence to the film.Atmosphere and Visuals
The film maintains the 80s-inspired aesthetic and humor of ""Thor: Ragnarok,"" with Waititi's signature style shining through. The action sequences are well-choreographed, with a mix of slapstick comedy and epic battles. The visual effects are stunning, creating a visually appealing experience.Conclusion
""Thor: Love and Thunder"" is a fun and entertaining addition to the MCU, despite its weak plot and confusing side quests. The film benefits from strong performances, engaging action sequences, and Waititi's distinctive direction. While it may not be the strongest entry in the franchise, it offers plenty of laughs and heartwarming moments for fans of the series.Rating: 6/10.",Helpful,•,0,0,drlex-15751,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur128266142/?ref_=tturv_usr_102_t,29-Oct-24,

The foundations and structure of the plot do follow the typical Marvel formula, but Taika's script and direction make this film feel nice and refreshing.Speaking of Taika's script it is very sharp and funny. Mix this with Hemsworth's comedic timing and delivery and you get a match made in heaven, so this is definitely the most I've laughed at a Marvel movie.Hemsworth really looked like he was having the time of his life playing Thor in this film which was so fun to watch. Natalie Portman back in the MCU and with such a badass role was brilliant to see.Bale played a pretty good villain, nothing outstanding but there was some decent development there and he brought a sufficient level of unhinged menace to the role.I will say the action was never particularly inspiring and I would have liked to seen more of Bale and have that role fleshed out a bit, but these criticisms are relatively minor and don't detract too much from the quality of the film, which for the most part is top notch.If you throw yourself into this film with reckless abandon and are happy to surrender to Taika Waititi's quirky and goofy humour then you will have a blast.",Helpful,•,3,5,ethanbresnett,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur114450253/?ref_=tturv_usr_104_t,7-Jul-22,

I don't know.,"Thor: Love and Thunder does its best being a true sequel to Ragnarok but the key elements are missing this time around: and that's Thor's buddy-relationship with his brother Loki. Christian Bale's character is like a stand-in for God of War's Kratos in terms of archetype, make-up and also fees like a 'campy-go-grumpy' stand-in for Tom Hiddleston's iconic trickster.There's stuff that works here, and stuff that doesn't. It's like a birthday cake that's got too many flavours in it all at once instead of being squarely triple-choc or vanilla; instead it tries overdoing the sweetness without distinction of flavour or craft. That's Thor: Love and Thunder, a film that tries being more by doing the exact same thing pretty much. It's feel-good without ample risk, but at least the typical MARVEL sense of fun is still there. It may not be inviting for anything particularly inspired, but this Thor film is determined to reinforce the character as a mainstay from here onward.This film has spark, but no real sense of awe beyond the action spectacle. Thor may not be as tried-and-true as other more established superheroes out there, but there's clearly room for improvement in the future.Thor: Love and Thunder gets 3/5 stars. It's the standard MARVEL-fare that's become a to-be-expected box office hit.Clearly MARVEL's formula is being called out by some; it works for others, but some see through the innately formulaic structures starting to get in the way of these adventures feeling fresh and inspiring. It's not a bad film at all, but long-standing characters deserve (and don't have any real right to be denied of) character development and expanding the creative horizons of their respective world.Even satisfying candies refine their formula to make themselves feel less 'complicit' with ordinariness from time to time.",Helpful,•,0,3,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur24085266/?ref_=tturv_usr_109_t,14-Sep-22,

It does have some good gags and the budget is high enough so that it largely looks big and flashy. I did laugh a few times and no scene was lazily made. But this is a waste of time.I think the scene where they put in 2 gay relationships via the dialogue kinda says it all. It's where I knew the movie wasn't going anywhere. You can usually spot a bad movie by what it tries to be. Modern Marvel movies can be great if they focus on the comic universe and a clear story. But today most of them are just given to a director or producer. So you may get someone who wants to recreate a proper and great old story in the universe like Thor: Ragnarok that was a remake of a great cartoon. The first Thor movie was a start of the story overall. A small story set among real people. This instead if a mess. The director of Thor: Ragnarok now tried to make it into a full on progressive comedy so a lot of the powerful relationships and deep story turn into gags. Some gags do work, but it's just scene after scene being a gag. A ton of flashbacks and small scenes. With the story itself becoming a gag. It reminds me of the Ghostbusters reboot where they took the universe and made it into a giant joke focused on progressive values and feminism. I didn't hate the reboot, but I can see why fans of that universe hated it. So as I'm a fan of the Marvel universe I really dislike what they are doing to it here. This movie focused on female Thor and overall progressive values instead of trying to expand the Thor universe. It's catering to the ignorant masses who buy movie tickets because the movie is progressive. The female Thor even calls herself Thor for some reason. What a mess. At least give her another uniform and another name. Thor is the name of a male god in the Norse mythology. There are PLENTY of female names you could use here. Just have the same character with another name. They do next to nothing with her anyhow so what's the point? It's like the last James Bond movie where they made agent 007 into a Black woman. Why? Call her 008 and that's just fine. Don't lazily reuse an old character to score some cheap points.The movie also fails as much here is created from ground up. There are new gods, a new significant secret key, even the old characters are now comedic so their old personalities are gone. A lot of the story is now gags and progressive scenes with the old universe taking a backseat. Thor: The Dark World (2013) being much better than this movie says it all as it was universally disliked. Even though I didn't hate everything about this movie there are so many pointless cringe scenes that it definitely takes away from the universe. I have no need to watch more Thor movies and I regret watching this one.By the way. Some of the kid actors are horrible. There is a Black kid who is given a female name for some gag reason. He was horrible. Absolutely a mess in every scene. Which is weird as the director made the fairly fun Hunt for the Wilderpeople (2016) with a kid actor and has many other movies with boy actors. So what went wrong? I think everyone was just being lazy here.",Helpful,•,3,4,JurijFedorov,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur4032055/?ref_=tturv_usr_124_t,27-Sep-22,

Thor joins forces with Valkyrie(Tessa Thompson), Korg(Taika Waititi) & old flame Jane Foster(Natalie Portman), to fight Gorr the God Butcher(Christian Bale), who plans to eradicate all gods.Thor: Love and Thunder is a mind-blowing film. Director Taika Waititi has knocked it out of the park yet again, after Thor: Ragnarok(2017). The action set pieces are awe-inspiring. The visual effects are fantastic. The 3D is eye-popping, especially in IMAX. The humor in the movie is guffaw worthy. There are also emotional moments, that differentiates this film from its 2017 predecessor. My favorite movie in Phase 4 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, after Spider-Man: No Way Home(2021). Chris Hemsworth is outstanding as Thor. Hemsworth goes from strength to strength each time he plays the God of Thunder. Natalie Portman is spectacular as Jane Foster/The Mighty Thor. Portman's triumphant return to the Marvel Cinematic Universe surpassed my already sky high expectations. Chris Hemsworth & Natalie Portman share effortless camaraderie together. Christian Bale is unforgettable as Gorr. Bale's performance makes his character one of the best villains in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Tessa Thompson is excellent as King Valkyrie. Taika Waititi is hilarious as Korg. Russell Crowe is superb as Zeus. The supporting cast is great. The cameos are memorable. Thor: Love and Thunder is a must watch for Marvel Cinematic Universe fans.

However, there were only a few dull moments. The movie was fun, funny, and curious, especially with its new character redesigns and plot twists.Taika Waititi did a good job directing this latest film in the ""Thor"" franchise. He also wrote a neat script with Jennifer Kaytin Robinson. As a fictional character, Thor was originally created for Marvel comics by Stan Lee and Jason Aaron.Barry Baz Idoine, the cinematographer, was the biggest winner in this film. Both Michael Giacchino and Nami Melumad's musical scoring was great. Nigel Phelps' production design was amazing. Good work also by the art direction and set decoration teams. Mayes C. Rubeo did superb work on costume design. The hair-makeup, VFX, CGI, sound, and stunts crews also brought their A-game.Thor, played by Chris Hemsworth, was amazing - his comedic timing was also on point. Jane Foster, aka Mighty Thor, played by Natalie Portman, was a revelation. Gorr, played by Christian Bale, was mindblowing. King Valkyrie, played by Tessa Thompson, was great. Korg, voiced by Taika Waititi, was memorable. Zeus, played by Russell Crowe, was brilliant - his every scene was masterful.Memorable cameos by Sam Neill (as stage-actor Odin, rather interesting), Matt Damon (as stage-actor Loki, rather funny), Luke Hemsworth (as stage-actor Thor, rather fitting), and Melissa McCarthy (as stage-actress Hela, rather hilarious).All other cast and crew did amazing work in ""Thor: Love and Thunder"" now streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.I loved how Waititi implemented and then balanced several captivating and entertaining angles and elements. As a result, an almost-2-hour movie felt half as short. That said, ""Thor: Love and Thunder"" did not live up to the standards set by previous ""Thor"" titles.Making a superhero out of Jane Foster was the best decision for this movie. Portman hit it out of the ballpark. This was in keeping with the comic books, including ""WHAT IF? #10"" (published in 1977), which saw a mortal Jane Foster transform into Thordis, the Goddess of Thunder. Goes to show how progressive that small slice of Marvel comic history was to have made such an empowered character all those years ago.In the movie, Thor's love for the dying Jane was strong enough to ensure that Mjölnir (whose shattered pieces were still on Earth) found her worthy to wield the deific hammer, thus saving her life for the time being and granting her fresh purpose. They covered plenty of key relationship elements between Thor and Jane, and it was fun to watch. But aside from Thor and his love, Mjölnir itself saw something in Jane, and therein was the real gift of all.As a villain, Gorr the God Butcher was an excellent addition to the cast. Christian Bale was stupendous in the role. He's going to be a hit among atheists. In truth, Bale was the best thing in ""Love and Thunder"". His character brought great meaning to the story.The movie contained a few fan-crazy moments, and two more-than-interesting post-credits scenes. I particularly loved the rock-n-roll elements. Somehow, despite having more than a few corny and clichéd elements, ""Thor: Love and Thunder"" did not fail to use them all to regale and entertain. It was good fun, though it wasn't as great as some of the ""Thor"" movies that preceded it.",Helpful,•,0,4,JoshuaMercott,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur94005246/?ref_=tturv_usr_129_t,11-Sep-22,

Case in point, I knew for a while that Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) became Thor for a while for medical reasons. In Thor: Love and Thunder (2022), this somewhat recent plot line from the comics combines with the modus operandi of Phase 4 of the MCU: wrapping up the loose ends from Phase 3 of the MCU.Doing a victory lap after his well-received Thor: Ragnarok (2017), Taika Waititi still brought his trademark comedic sensibilities to this movie but seemed to falter a bit with the much heavier themes of the God Killer (Christian Bale). In fact, I was expecting a bit more out of Bale, considering how dedicated he is to his roles. Don't get me wrong-there were still a bunch of really great action sequences in this movie, and the revelation of a council of gods is a profound theological can of worms that I'm sure will come into play in future films.The real problem with this movie was its lack of focus. Sure, it tied up the Jane Foster storyline from the first two Thor movies, but the only thing it really set up was a potential addition to the ""Young Avengers"" that Marvel keeps hinting at but not confirming is coming. Without knowing what this enormous Phase 4 of the MCU is headed toward, it's difficult to justify movies like this. Still, Love and Thunder was a fun action comedy to turn your brain off to for a few hours.A fun movie that lacked focus, I give Thor: Love and Thunder 3.5 stars out of 5.",Helpful,•,1,2,Benjamin-M-Weilert,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur100116496/?ref_=tturv_usr_130_t,29-Nov-22,

The element of drama was effective in the story, as the film revolves around the character of Thor completely this time, Thor is the most person who has loved people taken from him in MCU so far, starting with his mother, then Auden, then his homeland, Asgard, then Loki several times, and with this film it took more from him than before, all of this and still takes from him more at the end of the successive tragedies until the All Father character is formed and enters the MCU.With that being said, now come to the negative points of the movie. Some of the comedy scenes were inappropriate within the context of the scene and had no meaning. Taika Watiti tried to create a second Ragnarok inside the movie, but the importance of the story and its depth are not commensurate with this amount of irony, especially beside the presence of gods. The last fight had a few bugs and although it was fun, at one point I felt like Christian Bale's presence was just a way to attract viewers with his debut. After all, Love and Thunder isn't much better than Marvel's first-class work, but it's an enjoyable and worth watching movie experience, that's for sure.",Helpful,•,1,1,aboalhyjaa,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur69239269/?ref_=tturv_usr_132_t,12-Jul-22,
8,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8314451/?ref_=tturv_perm_133,Good Character Arcs for Thor and Jane,"Under the Writing and Direction of Taika Waititi, the THOR franchise portion of the Marvel Cinematic Universe has gone in a more comedic, rather than Shakespearean, direction and THOR: LOVE AND THUNDER proves that this direction is a smart one both for THOR and for the overall health and diversity of the Marvel Cinematic Universe as well.Starring Chris Hemsworth, of course, as the titular THOR, Love and Thunder shows our demi-god hero at a crossroads in his life and career. Into this world walks his ex-girlfriend, Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and chaos ensues as both are chasing the god-killer, Gorr (Christian Bale).This sort of premise set-up (and the fact that Hemsworth is playing THOR for the 8th time), could have fallen victim to banality and dullness, but under the watchful eye of Waititi (Writer/Director of the severely under-rated JOJO RABBIT), this THOR soars with the best of them and develops the overall arc and (eventual) pay-off of both Thor's and Jane's arcs precisely and (upon retrospection) in the only satisfying way that they could have ended. So, kudos needs to be given to Waititi for walking this tightrope and sticking the landing.Hemsworth, of course, is charming and buff as Thor and balances the action, romantic drama and comedic portions of this story well. Waititi brings more than just comic relief (though he has plenty of that as well) as the voice of Thor's buddy KORG, while Christian Bale is more than just one-dimensional (how can this actor be anything but interesting) as the main villain of this piece..What surprised me the most in this film is the portrayal of Jane Foster by Portman and how her character becomes the ""female Thor"" (that's not a spoiler, it's in the trailers) and does NOT become just ""Thor's girlfriend"". Portman has made no secret of her distaste of how her character became the femme fatale in THOR: THE DARK WORLD and refused to return to this character previously. Obviously, Waititi has been able to come up with a storyline - and an arc - that would interest an actress like Portman to return and Natalie nails it. She looked bright-eyed and energized by this part and by where her character goes in this film.And then there is Tessa Thompson's Valkyrie. This character is a strong part of Thor's story - and the story of the survivors of Asgaard (their destroyed homeworld). Thompson owns this part and is engaging and interesting to watch on-screen. Out of necessity, her character and story play a supporting role to the main Thor/Jane story, so her character didn't get quite enough to do for my tastes. But it did whet my appetite for a stand-alone Valkyrie film (make that happen Marvel).There are cameos and extended-cameos galore in this film - as well as TWO end credits scenes - so to mention them would be to spoil them, except to say that the GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY play a pivotal role, but for those who came to see a GUARDIANS film, you'll have to wait for GUARDIANS 3 to come out next year - this is a THOR film.A very satisfying entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and while not a perfect film (it does try too hard, at times, to mine the same, surprise comic gold of THOR: RAGNAROK), THOR: LOVE AND THUNDER delivers a stand-alone Thor story that drives both the characters of Thor and Jane forward in a smart, intelligent way...and when is the last time the words ""smart and intelligent"" were used with a comic book film)?Letter Grade: A-8 stars (out of 10) and can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",Helpful,•,2,5,bankofmarquis,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur10919398/?ref_=tturv_usr_133_t,8-Jul-22,
8,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8315823/?ref_=tturv_perm_134,A Very Fun Experience,"Being a huge fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, I must say that the first two instalments of the Thor franchise haven't been anywhere near my favourites. When Taiki Waititi was brought in to direct Thor: Ragnarok, he injected some much-needed life. Since then, Thor has been a much more enjoyable character to follow and I now look forward to seeing him every time. Hearing that Waititi would once again be back for the fourth film excited me a great deal, but I also knew it would be a very hard task to top the third film. Thor: Ragnarok is one of my favourite Marvel films, and while there are more than a few moments in Thor: Love and Thunder that harken back to what made Ragnarok great, it's not quite on the same level for me. Still, Thor: Love and Thunder is a genuine blast at the movies and here's why I recommend checking it out.Picking up after the events of Avengers: Endgame, while still being a sequel to the Thor films, the premise here is that Gorr (Christian Bale) who now wields a sword known as the ""Necrosword"", has a mission to murder every God in existence. After having killed many already, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is next in line. With the addition of a very well-done story that brings back Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), this film has a lot going for it. The villain storyline and Jane's storyline are both serious elements of the film, but otherwise, this is just a straight-up comedy, through and through. I liked the tonal shifts throughout the film because Taiki Waititi knows how to tread that line, even though a few moments tread a little too closely.If you were a fan of the silliness in Thor: Ragnarok, you'd probably love watching this film, but I will say that Thor: Love and Thunder dials it up to a hundred here. From giant screaming goats to a love triangle between his axe (Stormbreaker) and his ""ex-hammer"" (Mjolnir), I was laughing throughout. This will absolutely be a deterrent for some viewers though. Marvel is known to have a lot of comedy sprinkled throughout their films, but this one probably takes the cake for the amount of humour. The humour landed for me about 90% of the time though, so I had an absolute blast.Christian Bale is a fantastic addition here and is completely committed to this role, even though I wish he had a little more screen time. Where his storyline goes by the end may also leave viewers dissatisfied, but I kind of love how it concluded and I can't wait to see where those last few story beats lead. On top of that, I will say that Natalie Portman brings her A-Game here. I wasn't a huge fan of her in the first two Thor films, but her reason for being in this film was easily the best aspect of the movie for me. Again, like Gorr, I just wish a little more time was dedicated to her storyline. This is a film that clocks in at under two hours, but I believe an added 20 minutes or so could've fleshed everything out just a little more.In the end, this is the most fun I've had with a Marvel film in a while. Taiki Waititi's kinetic energy is on full display here, more than I've ever seen before (What We Do in the Shadows included) and Chris Hemsworth commands the screen with his portrayal of Thor, as always. The jokes fly a mile a minute, but I enjoyed that about this film, even though I was worried it would ruin my enjoyment. I do feel that it suffers a little from having multiple storylines and not quite enough time to explore them all, but I was ultimately satisfied with how everything played out. For being such a big story, I will also say that the scale of this one felt a little smaller than the rest of the Thor films. It almost felt episodic at times. Overall, Thor: Love and Thunder is absolutely a must-see if you enjoyed the silliness of Thor: Ragnarok, but some may be turned off. I personally give it a big recommendation because I had a lot of fun.",Helpful,•,4,4,kjproulx,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur23240045/?ref_=tturv_usr_134_t,9-Jul-22,

Perhaps even here it seems.We watched it on a Friday night. The popcorn was implied, it's a Marvel movie, so yeah all of life is at stake, or is it all of afterlife. But Taika is the man behind the curtain and the green screen pajamas, you know he's going to be clever but in a good-hearted way. There's a contrast of mortality, for mere humans as well as for the powerful beings.And no, I'm not talking about those powerful beings here flexing their reviewing might with ""1"" reviews (or the begrudging ""2s"" whose Mothers used to sing them Guns and Roses lullabies.

Even Spinal Tap did a few unplugged gigs.Speaking of outrage, I did catch a few minutes of the alternate version where Sonic Youth's early music was used as opposed Axl/Slash - and man that scene where Lady Thor takes out a certain son of a carpenter. Not sure I understood the whole pro-life is actually tied to ur-death motif. /sBack in the actual film, I did find an interesting contrast of superheroes and deities, granted deities that are pretty much no longer worshiped by anyone. Christian Bale was captivating on screen, and Taika does bring in some pretty big stars (and their kids per the credits).I get that it's not just incels who struggle with their impotence, and that while we may want heroes (or even hope against hope for honest politicans), life ends up being more complicated and disappointing than that.Love may feel like a treacly antidote.

All that changed when Taika Waititi took over the director's chair for ""Thor: Ragnarok"". Full of bright colors, poignant humor, and a complete reinvention of the character, ""Thor: Ragnarok"" is one of the most beloved stories in the MCU. Similarly, this film is bright, cheerful and flashy. It falls more in the comedy genre than action, which is both positive and distracting at times.The villain in this movie, Gorr the God Butcher, is one of the most fascinating antagonists in the MCU. His story is compelling and just looking at him will run chills down your spine. Christian Bale (""The Dark Knight"") nails his portrayal of the character and is one of the highlights of this movie.The film does a great job of recapping Thor's experience over the last decade and sets the stage without having to hop on Disney+ to watch the predecessors. The supporting characters are likable (especially Korg), the humor is exactly what you would expect from a Taika project and the runtime is well balanced.This is the first installment in the Thor franchise without his brother, Loki, and the absence is felt. Apart from Gorr, some of the new characters introduced were overly comedic and took away from the heart of the film. The second act was weak and focused more on setting up future installments than staying in the present.If you have seen the trailer, you know that the Guardians of the Galaxy are in this movie. Unfortunately, we will have to wait until ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" in 2023 to see them in action, because their screen time is extremely limited.There are moments with real character development and complex emotions, but those scenes are undermined by an onslaught of jokes. Personally, I love Taika Waititi's style and humor, but it might be too much for some viewers.""Thor: Love and Thunder"" is a popcorn flick. It is upbeat, visually impressive and transports you to another universe. The humor might be a bit excessive, but it's a break from the traditional MCU mold.

8,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8309258/?ref_=tturv_perm_143,A solid adventure that both satisfies and saddens,"""Thor: Love and Thunder"" is the 29th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the fourth solo film to focus around the Marvel superhero Thor. Directed and co-written by Taika Waititi (""Thor: Ragnarok"", ""Jojo Rabbit"") and again starring Chris Hemsworth in the lead role, it continues the God of Thunder's journey throughout the universe in a solid adventure that both satisfies and saddens.After the events of ""Avengers: Endgame"", Thor (Chris Hemsworth) has been in outer space with the Guardians of the Galaxy, visiting distant planets to help out their inhabitants with any problems they are facing. Some time later, Thor is forced to part way with the Guardians after he receives an emergency signal from New Asgard back on Earth. Upon arriving home, Thor is informed that a being known as Gorr the God Butcher (Christian Bale) has come into possession of the god-murdering Necrosword and intends to wipe out all gods from existence, with the citizens of New Asgard next on his hit list. With this new danger looming, Thor hurriedly recruits his associates Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson), Korg (Taika Waititi), and his old flame Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), the latter of whom has taken up the mantle of ""Mighty Thor"", to stop Gorr from his deicidal killing spree.Since he was first introduced into the MCU back in 2011, Thor's solo films have been, to put it mildly, a mixed bag. The first two struggled to find a harmonious tone, with an inconsistent blend of out-of-place comedy and unnecessarily dark moments preventing them from becoming memorable additions to the ever-expanding Marvel Cinematic Universe. In fact, if it weren't for the amusing antics of Loki (Tom Hiddleston), I assume most people would skip these two films without a second thought. All of this was rectified in 2017 with ""Thor: Ragnarok"" finally striking the right balance between humorous and serious themes, all of which can be traced back to the involvement of Taika Waititi. All of that remains here in ""Thor: Love and Thunder"", as it thankfully continues everything that made its predecessor such a great inclusion to the MCU.Though it doesn't deviate too much from the previous film in terms of tone, this one still retains the same amount of fun and energy that all the MCU fans crave. Here, we get to see Thor as a more upbeat character, who has worked through many of his personal insecurities that were holding him back following his fight with Thanos years ago. He is more optimistic and sure of himself, and despite causing the occasional collateral damage like most superheroes, he always finds ways to make up for it (or at the very least TRIES to).I like how over the course of three prior solo outings and four ""Avengers"" films, Thor has since developed some of the most relatable humanistic traits in the whole MCU, which is interesting considering the character is supposed to be a perfect god. We've seen him go through a wide range of personality changes, from self-important deity, humbled defender of Earth, depressed wreck haunted by his mistakes, and now a man contemplating what his future might bring. But it is in the latter example we see Thor delve deep into what is arguably the most important emotion of all: Love.Considering the film has the word ""Love"" in its title, it stands to reason that it will be the overarching theme its main character will grapple with. Long time MCU fans will remember Thor's original love interest Jane Foster, the astrophysicist from the first two movies whose belief in a scientific explanation for everything is shattered when she meets the God of Thunder for the first time. Though the two seemed to hit it off at first, certain factors prevented the pair from going any further, leading to their break-up and, in turn, her not appearing in the third film.Foster returns here with a vengeance as she makes up for her absence with her new identity as ""Mighty Thor"". Watching as Thor tries to comprehend the sight of his ex-girlfriend donning not only similar attire to him but also using a repaired version of his old hammer Mjolnir provided some amusing comic relief upon their reunion and the way he handles this situation shows how far he has come as a character. He now truly feels a love for someone unlike anything he has felt previously, allowing the story to take their relationship to levels not seen before.In addition to implementing all of these new romantic elements, director Taika Waititi also uses his eye for visual detail to the film's advantage. He shows us brightly coloured locations such as the Omnipotent City, a sprawling metropolis populated by various other gods, including Zeus himself (played by Russell Crowe). Waititi uses this place in particular to show how these gods all have different attitudes to what their titles may suggest. For instance, some of these gods actually care about the well-being of the less fortunate while others just find their positions nothing more than a burden. These moments allow for some quirky universe-building that only a film set in the MCU could properly pull off.But it's not all vibrant environments we get to see. There's also the Shadow Realm, a sinister place lit only by the colours of black and white. When our heroes arrive at this menacing location, the film starts to resemble those classic colourless feature films, tapping into that old school feeling of people exploring somewhere frightening. The movie's antagonist Gorr appropriately considers this place home and his dark intentions suit it to a tee. The way in which Waititi is able to balance these two polar opposite locations alongside one another is testament to his talent as a filmmaker and goes to show that his presence among the MCU staff is a welcome one.Returning to the role after a three-year absence, Chris Hemsworth demonstrates how much he has evolved alongside Thor as a character, going from a stoic overpowered god to a fun-loving hero not afraid to show his sensitive side. Hemsworth uses his signature Aussie larrikin likeability to bring out the amusement factor that makes what I call the ""Waititi-era"" Thor a more endearing hero than when he was first introduced. His scenes with Natalie Portman as Jane Foster had a believable warmth to them, which is surprising since I always thought they lacked chemistry with one another in the first two films. I guess it was simply poor writing in those movies because with the way the pair interact here you'd swear their relationship always had this much of a spark to it. With that in mind, Portman is clearly enjoying herself more this time, considering she has a more physical role in the story than before. It's nice to see her occasionally one-up her co-star during the film's action scenes as she manages to hold her own when the going gets tough.I also think Christian Bale did a good job as the film's main villain Gorr, a man hell-bent on causing the extinction of all gods. Knowing how talented an actor Bale is, it was nice to see him provide the character with more dimension than your typical MCU antagonist. Without venturing into spoiler territory, Gorr's backstory is shown to be quite tragic, immediately clueing the audience into why he is on this genocidal crusade in the first place. The best types of villains are the ones who think they are doing everything for the greater good (like a certain purple Titan wielding a gauntlet), and I did feel sorry for Gorr once I understood his motivations, although this of course doesn't justify him wanting to murder the innocent.Now four solo movies in, it's great to see how a hero like Thor has finally found the appropriate balance between a powerful god and a regular person. Though I think there is little else that can be done in future films to develop the character beyond what we have right now, we can still appreciate him for what he is already - a genuine person with relatable flaws. And that is what I believe to be one of the reasons why the MCU has been successful for so long - it shows that heroes, even literal gods, are capable of going through legitimate growth and changes to become better people. That and the casual humour of course. Either way, it has proven to be a winning combination.I rate it 8/10.",Helpful,•,143,156,MrDHWong,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur18374284/?ref_=tturv_usr_143_t,7-Jul-22,
7,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8309580/?ref_=tturv_perm_144,The comedy in this fourth Thor film often unnecessarily overshadows the story and drama sides.,"Thor: Love and Thunder is the fourth Thor film in the film series. Like the third Thor film, this film is directed and this time also partly written by Taika Waititi.In the film, after all his adventures, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is somewhat lost in his life and decides to go back to New Asgard. Before returning here, he learns that a dark creature called Gorr the God Butcher (Christian Bale) is on a mission to kill all the gods.When he arrives in New Asgard he wants to ask Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson) for help, but here he sees that his old hammer Mjolnir has been restored, but has found another owner. This owner is his ex-girlfriend Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), who has magically taken over his hammer and powers. Along with Valkyrie and Korg (voice of Taika Waititi), both try to stop Thors Gorr before he manages to kill more gods.With this film, Tor is the first superhero from the Marvel film series to have four films of his own. Taika Waititi managed to get the Thor series moving again with the third Thor movie and is trying to do the same again with this fourth movie. Together with other script and story writers from other Marvel projects, he managed to turn the third Thor film into a more appropriate comedy action Sci-Fi film. In this fourth Thor film, the writing comes only from Taika Waititi herself and the more aspiring writer Jennifer Kaytin Robinson. The fact that the writing now comes from fewer people is reflected in the film. This fourth Thor film contains too many comedy elements, which often unnecessarily overshadow the drama moments and other elements. The comedy also comes at the cost of some of the different storylines, making some of these seem a bit rushed and if not clear which can sometimes lead to a more long-winded feel.Fortunately, Taika Waititi knows how to provide beautiful and believable visual effects in the film and thus brings out different worlds of the gods in creative ways. For example, he brings out the divine sides of the Marvel film universe more clearly and more playfully than they tried to do in the Marvel film Eternals, for example. In this film he also manages to use rock music from the 80s as a soundtrack in a fun and appropriate way.The returning cast members once again reprise their roles in this film. Despite the lesser sides of the script, Taika Waititi managed to persuade Natalie Portman to return to the Thor film series. Portman gets more drama sides with this film, but also super power sides to work with. In addition to Natalie Portman, Taika Waititi also managed to get Christian Bale back to act in a superhero movie with the script and request of his children. After his time as Batman in The Dark Knight trilogy, he no longer wanted to act in superhero movies. Bale brings a darker serious side to this film, adding more darkness and some light tension.",Helpful,•,24,20,movieman6-413-929510,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur34790048/?ref_=tturv_usr_144_t,7-Jul-22,

The dialogue is atrocious, the attempt at humour is for children who has never seen a movie before, and the story is beyond contempt. This movie is also very short and it feels very rushed, very cut off like they wanted to make 40min more but did not have the budget or the studio hated it so they sliced of 5min here and there. And the acting... sorry but this is probably the worst acting I have seen in any Marvel movie. Every scene feels forced, and every actor look like they do to not want to be in this movie.Almost all the negatives I mention above I would blame on the director which leads me to my main complaint; the directing is absolutely horrible. This is badly put together, badly edited, too short, badly told and if actors that we know can put in a good performance do not that has to be blamed on the director.Everything else I mainly blame on the script. OMG this is so badly written, absolutely horrible. This movie is written by a 12yo blind and deaf fan of bad humour and then it has been added to by Darth Kennedy who was brought in to polish the script.

He hams it up a lot, but it feels purposeful. It's also fun to see him play the role of megalomaniacal villain and his motivations are very understandable, even if sorta under baked. Even the segment that takes place in Gorr's homeworld (dimension?) is easily the most visually interesting aspect of the film.Hemsworth is always good as Thor. He has great leading man charisma, but the way the character is treated as a joke for a large portion of the movie feels very strange and quite the departure even from Ragnarok, where ""goofy Thor"" made his debut. It's as if between that film and the two Avengers, he went down a couple of IQ points. Russell Crowe as Zeus was pretty fun, and I like how he was the sort of antagonist we don't typically see in these movies: a self indulgent, lazy narcissist.I also like the general comedic tone - to an extent - for the sole reason that it represents a change for the MCU. Just like Multiverse of Madness, this movie is really the product of an auteur, mixed with the MCU's requisite standards. While that might not sound good, it does mean the film feels refreshing and tonally distinct from other instalments, even if not always for the best.The Bad: As you're probably aware, Love and Thunder is basically a comedy. It's a funny movie, but it's almost trying so hard to be funny that it comes off as somewhat exhausting. Humour is obviously subjective, so what's funny to me isn't funny to you. I get it. But I think the humour here actively impacts the narrative.Bale's Gorr the God Butcher isn't a very threatening villain and despite some heavy stuff happening, Waititi seems intent on undercutting EVERYTHING with a joke. Jane has cancer? Gorr kidnaps children? The Gods are selfish jerks and maybe should get comeuppance? Difficult ideas are just watered down to the point where you can't take the movie very seriously.It's also hard to explain, but the type of jokes this movie engages in just...feels stale even by the end of the movie. I know in the depths of my soul that this movie will not stand the test of time. There are some jokes that are already dated that confusingly made it into this movie.As for the story, it's very basic and straightforward. Thor needs to stop Gorr and Jane is helping him. That's essentially it. Whereas Ragnarok was pretty clearly a commentary on colonialism and how societies will always, inevitably, have to reckon with it, Love and Thunder doesn't really go anywhere. It doesn't even have a premise; it's trying to be a romantic comedy, but has to also be a generic comic book action film as well. So what we get are both genres messily mashed together and the film never excels in either genre. I do have to say Portman and Hemsworth have pretty natural chemistry, but it's just not enough to carry the film.Tessa Thompson as Valkryie is just really bad. She seems completely checked out of the movie and her character has nothing to do. Watiti as Korg REALLY overstays his welcome and oh my god, those screaming goats. When I say that this movie has some jokes that are just run into the ground, it's these - three? - characters who are the worst culprits.I was shocked by how bad the visual effects were as well. Rumours about the toxic environment that Disney fosters for VFX artists are vindicate with this one. The movie has some very uneven CG, with several moments - some of which have already become infamous on the internet - when my jaw dropped at how bad certain characters and set pieces looked. It's not a good look for such an effects heavy movie.The Ugly: Waititi's distinctive style and sense of humour is all over this thing, and generally, if you find him and his stuff funny, I think you'll like this movie. But, whereas Ragnarok felt like a refreshing and necessary direction for the character to take, Love and Thunder feels like going in the direction for a bit too long and missing the destination. It's not a bad movie, but it's not a particularly memorable one and I can't imagine it gets better with repeat viewings.",Helpful,•,4,3,ryanpersaud-59415,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur65683941/?ref_=tturv_usr_152_t,17-Jul-22,
6,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8328592/?ref_=tturv_perm_153,An Above Average Mess Of A Film,"One of the most hyped films, Thor: Love and Thunder is out and I have now finally had a chance to watch it and here is my review for the film. The premise of the film sees Thor attempting to work himself out when he must team up with his ex Jane Foster in order to stop a new enemy.Main Character
Chris Hemsworth has now played Thor for 11 Years and he could play the role in his sleep. He is great in this film and he is just so good as the character and has made him into a really fun lead character. Thor had a great story arc in Avengers Endgame and it kind of continues here with his character getting an interesting deep dive with a continued progression which is good to see.Supporting Characters
Natalie Portman as Jane Foster was a pretty dull part of the previous Thor films but I actually liked her here and I definitely feel like this is the best she has done. Seeing her take up the role of Mighty Thor is really entertaining and seeing the two Thor's in action adds something fresh to the film. The story between the two of them is well handled and I thought this was the most chemistry that Portman and Hemsworth have had. Tessa Thompson is back as Valkyrie and she is pretty fun once again, her character doesn't get much development but she is always entertaining and Thompson is clearly having a lot of fun in the role. But there are some falters here, Christian Bale plays Gorr The God Butcher and it just didn't work for me. He was a dull villain who wasn't given enough time for you to really care and Bale switches from intense to goofy too often for me and it just makes his character feel inconsistent. Korg is one of my favourite characters in the MCU but he is in this film way too much and his overuse of comedy is too forced and takes away from the overall product. I think it shows that he is best in smaller doses and they shouldn't have him as front and centre as he is here.Story
The story is at its best when it focuses on the relationship between Thor and Jane. There is some real drama here mixed with some nice humour, in interviews it was claimed it would be the biggest part of that film and it succeed here. But the story just feels incredibly rushed and a bit all over the place, it tries to balance really serious moments with comedy and it really doesn't work at all with an ending that also didn't quite work for me.Script
The script is actually quite funny, its not as funny as Ragnarok but there are some chuckle worthy moments. There is some good drama here that is actually quite dark which I don't think people would be expecting to see here. But the film goes way too hard on the comedy and it just doesn't work, the two things clash and create this mess of a script.Style
The film looks really good, the action is pretty exciting and in this day of age the CGI looks really good. Seeing the two Thor's in action is really fun and made the action scenes a bit more fun then it would have been if it had just been Thor. But the film isn't paced very well, it clocks in at around 1 hour 45 and it feels rushed. Also as good as it is, there wasn't one action set piece that really stood out for me.Overall
Overall, Thor: Love and Thunder is an above average film that has its moments but it falls way short of expectations and I think only big MCU fans will appreciate it as much as me.Rating - 6/10.",Helpful,•,1,4,alindsayal,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur147091341/?ref_=tturv_usr_153_t,12-Jul-22,

I do like the trailers that got made for the film. The people that make trailers for films by Marvel Studios do a good job. The film itself, however, turned out to be easily the worst Marvel film so far. I didn't expect Marvel to release a film this bad, but it happened. This is the first Marvel film that I don't want to see again. I'd rather be apprehended by Elon Musk's private right-wing militia than to see Thor: Love And Thunder again. Well, fine, the film is not that bad. But I definitely don't look forward to seeing it again. What makes it bad is the fact that almost everything in it is played for laughs. Nothing can be taken seriously. There are too many jokes and too much silly stuff. I'd say that about a third, or at most half, of the comedy in the film is effective, but the rest is mostly cringeworthy. Christian Bale, as usual, attempted to deliver a good performance, but his performance got wasted on a film where it doesn't belong. Since this is a Marvel film, the costumes and the special effects that got made for it are good as usual. But, again, they're wasted on a misguided film. I don't know if it was Taika Waititi's intention to make the film this bad. It probably wasn't. He was probably given too much freedom to do whatever he wanted and this has resulted in something farcical. I like every Thor film by Marvel that came before this one. Thor: Love And Thunder has a 64% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes. It doesn't deserve this rating. The rating should be rotten, quite rotten. I've never trusted Rotten Tomatoes because of one simple reason. Most professional film critics in the West are not reliable. They are bought and paid for, they are politically motivated, or they simply don't know what they're talking about. Hollywood films have been getting worse for several decades already, but the professional film critics either don't realize this or they don't want to talk about this issue. Therefore, they award high scores to films that don't deserve praise, they clobber films that don't deserve to be clobbered, and they go about their jobs as if nothing has changed. This is why I almost never check what they have to say on Rotten Tomatoes. If Thor: Love And Thunder hadn't had some propaganda in it, I think that its rating on Rotten Tomatoes would have been much lower. Unfortunately, many people simply repeat what they read on a website like Rotten Tomatoes. If a film is certified rotten on this website, they think that it's a bad film. This is not how I think. But, anyway, since Thor: Love And Thunder is a film by Marvel Studios, I still went to see it in a theater. Not everything about it is bad. Some of the comedy works, especially at the beginning. The direction is misguided but fine. The performances by the actors are fine. But, overall, the film is a disaster because nothing in it can be taken seriously. In addition, the action is disappointing and almost non-existent. Of course, there is one thing that could have saved Thor: Love And Thunder in its present state, or at least partially redeemed it. This would have been an inclusion of Zeus's planned orgy in the end credits scene. Or we could have at least been shown how Rich Evans defeats Thanos singlehandedly in an alternate universe. But instead what we got was Zeus talking to his son Hercules about killing Thor. How disappointing.",Helpful,•,1,0,khanbaliq2,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur22131361/?ref_=tturv_usr_155_t,28-Dec-23,

This movie tried even harder to be funny than its predecessor, but trying is not the same as succeeding. It felt like a movie made mostly of tongue in cheek montages that occasionally remembered to add plot and stakes. Very occasionally. Why were the Guardians of the Galaxy necessary? Why did we need whole sub-plots about Asgard theatre troops? Why did Russell Crowe have to go THAT far with his whole schtick? Almost everyone other than Thor, Jane, and Gorr seemed like ironic cardboard cutout scenery. I appreciate the sense of humor, but it's not enough on its own.

4,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8310534/?ref_=tturv_perm_157,Too Short and Fast-Paced and Too Much Komdi,"I haven't felt this much disappointment in years regarding MCU movies, and I didn't even expect much after the mediocre reviews. I was really excited back when I first heard the news of Christian Bale joining the movie, but just as I expected, he had little screen time and the script focused more on the comedy and throwing jokes at us every second than give us a good story.Like I'm sorry, but did I miss something, or did Gorr only have 3 or 4 brief scenes before his first actual encounter and conversation with Thor? Like it felt like he had even less screen time than Hela. He had only 3 minutes of ""origin story"" and ""characterization"" in the beginning and that's it, he doesn't come back until nearly 40 or 50 minutes into the film. Really really hate it and am disappointed in how they did not give the minimum characterization to this villain, or even to Jane for that matter. It felt like they deleted at least 10 minutes of Gorr origin from the beginning. The whole movie felt like it was a recap of a 3 hour or at least a 2:30-hour movie. Like it doesn't feel like a movie at all, and it's all because of the mediocre script.It's the same with the Jane situation; we're just thrown into her story and it doesn't get the development it deserves because of the short runtime and there's just a tiny little bit of emotional attachment to this character and not the amount of attachment the movie wants you to have. And it's because of the mediocrely written scrip, it's because of the short runtime that has lots of times for Thor goofing around with the Guardians and joking, and not establishing its villain and giving him proper screen time and giving him and Jane good characterization.The whole script is written so weirdly that it feels like it's only included the plot points but not the establishing scenes and the essential ""let the scene breathe"" scenes. The whole events of the movie happen so fast and they are joined together in a way that doesn't feel natural or like an actual movie, it doesn't feel like this movie has 3 acts, it feels like 1 or maybe 2 acts. And I keep saying ""feel"" because it's my opinion after all and I don't want to present them as objective facts.I guess some of the scenes and jokes are funny, but it's so overdone that looks like the movie was written by a teenager for 5-year-olds. Of course, I knew that the movie was gonna have lots of comedy because Ragnarok made Thor popular again and they found their golden formula with Thor, but I didn't expect them to turn Thor into a goofball. What is it with their obsession to turn every character into a Star-Lord and a Guardians of the Galaxy character? Thor was perfect in Infinity War, the Russo brothers knew what they were doing and they knew how to balance comedy and serious, and that's why all of their movies are 8/10 or more for me and that's the reason their movies are the top fan favorites among all the MCU movies.When you think about it, the story and plot structure of this movie is not too dissimilar from Ragnarok, but for some reason, that movie that was also 2 hours, felt like an actual movie, but this one doesn't. So maybe they should've kept the writers?It's funny that Taika said they have the best villain in the MCU, while I feel like even Malekith that I don't remember anything about, had better characterization and origin?! Like after watching the movie, all I can say about the character of Gorr, is that ""he had a daughter and now he doesn't"" and that's it. And this was supposed to be ""the best villain ever""?! Even the most forgettable villain from MCU, Ghost from Ant-Man 2 had better characterization time and origin. Like I actually don't understand how they thought showing Gorr for 2 minutes at the beginning, without even showing what actually happened to him and his daughter and giving us a proper characterization, and then making him show up again after 40 minutes is good writing and good characterization and is gonna make the audience care. Baffling. I don't understand why they are deleting so much from the movies and making them only 2 hours that feel rushed and that they need more time for characterization and developing the plots and the characters, when they literally made the best-selling movie of all time with Endgame that was 3 hours? Even Spider-Man No Way Home had more than 2 hours of run time. So why not give Doctor Strange and Thor more time so they don't feel rushed!? At least Doctor Strange 2 still felt like an actual movie with a three-act structure and knew not everything has to be a joke. (Although arguably some of the most cringiest jokes of MCU were from that movie)Another thing I'm disappointed in is Michael Giacchino's music for this movie. I may have not expected much from this movie, but I had really high hopes for the music. And don't get me wrong, the piece is an absolute banger of a theme, but I expected at least 2 or 3 more themes? They uploaded the theme before the movie came out and I thought it was good and that there was also gonna be more in the movie, but it wasn't? It's just 2 or 3 other variations of the same theme? Really? That's it? Just one theme for the whole movie which occasionally is played as a sad and somber variation? I know that Doctor Strange 2016's themes were also mostly variations of the main theme, but they sounded different enough and had more themes. But this one only has one theme and that's disappointing to me. I wasn't really a fan of his Batman theme too, felt too repetitive and nothing iconic or memorable. Even his No Way Home had like some good different themes. I still wish he composed for every one of these movies (not Black Panther of course) andSo pretty much every aspect of this movie is a disappointment.What these movies need is more time spent in pre-production and I'm talking about pre-vis for the action scenes, I'm talking about more time spent in the writing room improving the scripts. How can this multi-billion dollar company not find good writers? Maybe bring back Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely? Because they seem to actually know how to write competent scripts that might have cringey jokes in them too, but have serious moments too and don't turn everything into a joke and rush things by cramming everything into 2 hours.Also, have we not gotten tired of villains summoning minions and demon creatures to fight for them and they just sit far behind and watch?! Even Hela had a decent fight scene with the Asgardian army in Ragnarok and that me feel like at least they will do a good fight scene with Gorr, but they didn't?! Like do they not realize how boring it is to introduce an already underdeveloped villain with bad characterization and laughably bad origin scene, only to have him sit somewhere and just summon demons to fight for him? Like imagine if instead of Captain America jumping into the battle with his shield and fighting the bad guys, he just stood there and sent some random guys to fight for him. Or instead of Thor going around with his hammer and defeating enemies, he just summoned some kids to fight for him... oh! That was actually one of the coolest scenes though, but you get what I mean.My disappointment with Gorr is immeasurable and my day is ruined.In conclusion, Gorr had a horrible origin story (his origin is ok, but not presented well. Might as well just write his origin on a black screen and not show anything) and worse characterization. He made decisions so quickly and changed his motivation and his mind so quickly and so many times like a teenager who doesn't know what he wants. Jane had a bad characterization too because the short run time didn't allow her story to become more developed and they could've presented her story in a better way. The action scenes are nice but what is action good for when you have a really bad script? Thor is turned into a more goofball and an idiot than he was before. The music is nice but only has one theme. Gorr has really awful screen time. The movie doesn't feel like an actual film. There are not 3 acts here, it feels like one act. Too short and rushed and nothing gets developed in this short run time. They have time for jokes but not actual character and plot development and decent characterization.Thoroughly disappointed in the villain and everything else, and I would've ignored some of the other problems if Gorr was actually well-written, had a good origin story of more than 5 minutes, actual good characterization and development, and much, much more screen time than this.",Helpful,•,5,8,MamadNobari97,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur45507551/?ref_=tturv_usr_157_t,7-Jul-22,

Welcome back to the exciting world of the Marvel Cinematic Universe! In this new addition, Thor enlists the help of Valkyrie, Korg, and ex-girlfriend Jane Foster to fight Gorr the God Butcher, who intends to make the gods extinct.This hilarious and fun movie was directed by the creative and playful Taika Waititi, as well as written by him with writing help by Jennifer Kaytin Robinson. Stan Lee gets writing credits for his visionary Marvel comics. Man, I miss seeing his cameos in Marvel movies.THINGS I LIKED:
Chris Hemsworth was made for this role. He's bigger and badder than ever. His trainer, Luke Zocchi stated, ""He is in phenomenal nick. He's the biggest he has ever been. He's the heaviest he's ever been. This extent of musculature required Hemsworth to eat at least 8 times a day during the entire duration of filming just to maintain all the muscle mass he had acquired."" There's a scene when we see Hemsworth completely naked from behind and shirtless from the front. Speaking about his physique, admiring Chris Pratt called Hemsworth a man-God. Ha ha Chris Hemsworth's son Tristan is seen in the movie as the young Thor.Who doesn't love Thor? He has more stand-alone films than any other MCU character.The cast features five Oscar winners - Christian Bale, Matt Damon, Natalie Portman, Taika Waititi, and Russell Crowe - and two Oscar nominees - Bradley Cooper and Melissa McCarthy.To catch everyone up to speed, an entertaining summary features video clips from Thor's past movies, plus a few new ones to fill in the blanks.Wow, I didn't even recognize Christian Bale until he started to speak! Initially, he turned down the role but his kids begged him to do it. His performance is exceptional and what takes the parody style of the movie into an Avenger battle.It's so great to see the beautiful and talented Natalie Portman again. She looks amazing.I adore the Guardians of the Galaxy, so I loved their inclusion in this story.So much humor, both visual and spoken.Fun, rocking soundtrack.So many fun cameos like Matt Damon, Melissa McCarthy, and...no more spoilers.Lots of flashbacks and fun Easter Eggs for true MCU fans.As with all MCU films, keep watching during the final rolling credits for another scene and sneak peek at what's to come.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
Not all of the humor lands. In fact, some of the cheap and quirky jokes get in the way of developing a powerful movie. Overall, the movie feels like a goof-fest and even a little embarrassing.What the heck was that accent supposed to be for Zeus? Russell Crowe's portrayal was way too silly and even disrespectful for the all-powerful Zeus.Christian Bale's character was interesting and completely underutilized. Korg had more screen time and lines than the villain in the film. Bad move.TIPS FOR PARENTS:

It seems unable to find the genre it wants to fit in, keeping the same humour from Ragnarok, but mixing it with horror in Bale's Gorr. Neither genre is able to build momentum, meaning typically funny scenes, which would have landed in the previous film, have far less impact, yet the comedy is too constant to allow any other tone for the film.For the most part, the performances of the cast are brilliant. Hemsworth is in phenomenal shape and perfectly encapsulates the Thor character that has come to be the norm, funny and zainy but able to pull the emotional parts off easily. Portman makes an excellent return, displaying the contrast of frailty and power superbly. Bale is outstanding, its a shame Gorr isn't allowed to flourish in a darker context given Bale's performance.Crowe, for me, had a very dodgy 'Greek' accent, and was used as comic relief in a time when it wasn't needed. Zeus was wasted as a whole. Axl/Astrid was also particularly rigid playing Heimdall's son.There is a period around the halfway mark in the Shadow Realm where everything becomes infinitely better, and Bale is able to shine. The use of colour (or lack thereof) is powerful and is the only time where a clear period of terror/darkness is created. They are great scenes, and everything appears to improve, even the CGI.The CGI largely looks pretty good, but particularly during the early stages of the film does appear less crisp, as is frequently becoming the case in MCU films released in this period. However, screen ratio is used very well, often switching, but without much rhyme or reason. Taking up the full screen does make those scenes look particularly good though.The story is from great source material and holds up, but often isn't executed the correct way, and characters feel a little twisted to fit the comedic tone. That's the issue with Love & Thunder, it does not replicate the fun success of Ragnarok, and doesn't have a lot else to fall back on.",Helpful,•,1,4,deepfrieddodo,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur123203865/?ref_=tturv_usr_162_t,16-Sep-22,

Love and Thunder still looks good, it has the same kind of visual sensibility that helped Ragnarok stand out from the pack. The fight in the shadow realm has some nice cinematography and choreography with the action. Jane's return is also intriguing from moment one, I can't go far into spoiler territory but they do find a new angle on it to make Jane as Thor unstoppable yet vulnerable at the same time. The rest of the plot isn't as unique or fresh but the creative team handled her character's return with a lot of tact.Writer/Director Taika Waititi brought the Thor movies back into the limelight with Ragnarok and a lot of the legwork was done through putting the focus on the comedy. It kept things breezy and Hemsworth can pull it off so Ragnarok avoided getting bogged down in the drama like The Dark World did. That mindset is present here, but it's regrettable that most of the comedic bits in Love and Thunder just aren't funny. Do you remember the screaming goat video? Hope you found that funny and get ready for that joke 10-20 times. Think Thor getting jealous over Mjolnir being reformed and ignoring Stormbreaker isn't awkward? It's actually hilarious....right? Humour is subjective but I can't remember the last time I saw a comedy in theatres where there was such a low hit rate with the jokes. Love and Thunder feels like it's trying too hard to replicate the spontaneity and surprise that Ragnarok had up its sleeve to diminishing returns.The MCU has larger names but I'm of the mindset that Chris Hemsworth is one of the more underrated actors in their stable. He's got all the physicality, he's capable of running the emotional gauntlet and he's really funny when given the opportunity. Love and Thunder gives him the chance to reunite with Portman and he's absolutely game, he smashes the bad guys and tells the jokes as required. It was nice to see Natalie back too, her departure from the franchise was very unceremonious and she's given more to do in Love and Thunder. She's a good addition to Thor 4 and her character felt like the most original part of the movie. Tessa Thompson is still doing her thing as Valkyrie, she's still got great chemistry with Hemsworth and while she's given less to do than you realize, she holds up her end of the bargain. Ditto for Christian Bale who gets a chance to be more hammy here and there but other than the opening couple of scenes, he's left playing the same couple of notes on the piano for the rest of the movie. He's a great actor and I thought he deserved more to do just like Thompson did. The Guardians are in and out of this movie so quickly, they're respectively fine in their bit. Casting Russell Crowe as Zeus was a nice twist and while he's clearly having fun, I thought the bit went on too long.As much as Waititi re-energized the franchise with Ragnarok, the end result with Love and Thunder just isn't at the same level. I had heard going in that the critics were nitpicking and that Waititi was making such weird and refreshing choices with the material. When the credits rolled I was just confused. What was so daring or different in this movie? There are macro plot beats (Jane's return, the city of the gods maybe?) that go a different way but the movie recycles a similar aesthetic, presents us with a largely two dimensional villain and it's the same old search for the Macguffin. To my surprise and while I think Taika is capable of incredible work (Jojo Rabbit was a huge surprise for me), this is just a lacklustre script and the film presents itself as more quirky and edgy than it actually is.If you had told me at the start of the summer that I was going to like Madness of the Multiverse better than Love and Thunder, I don't know if I would have believed you. Maybe expectations were too high but I feel like Waititi and his team just couldn't capture the same magic twice and what we were left with here was a decent looking and passable effort that was underwhelming overall. Most of the comedy falls flat and the story failed to keep me interested. As much as I enjoy Hemsworth as this character, unless we're partying with the rest of the Avengers, I'm not sure if we need another Thor solo adventure.

The premise is two-fold, with Thor (Chris Hemsworth) waging a war with the Gods to save a bunch of kids from the hands of a butcher named Gorr (Christian Bale). At the same time, he is also navigating his rocky love story with Dr. Jane Foster aka The Mighty Thor (Natalie Portman). Along the way, Thor encounters some old friends, makes some new ones and goes from flexing his big guns to doing a full Monty in a matter of minutes.Director Taika Waititi's personal take on pop culture, music, fashion and humour is pretty evident throughout the 120-odd minutes. Mind you, the film has some genuinely funny moments, but most of them don't actually involve Thor. You will see a lot of familiar faces from Thor's universe and multiple references to previous films and some cross-over moments. In fact, one of the best scenes in the film is a long show-reel that introduces Thor to the audience.What the film excels at is giving the audience a bang for their buck. The VFX, the sets and action scenes are top-notch. In fact, the fight scenes that involve The Might Thor and Gorr are some of the best choreographed moments in recent MCU history. Russel Crowe's Zeus act is hilarious and looking at him you can't help but wonder if this was the guy who once played a Gladiator.Christian Bale is rock solid as Gorr and menacing in most parts. Natalie Portman and Chris Hemsworth have great chemistry and their comic timing is on point as well. The soundtrack, especially the late 80's rock tracks, adds flavour to the big scenes.If you don't compare it to Thor: Ragnarok, then Thor: Love and Thunder is enjoyable. There are classic goofy Thor moments and then the larger-than-life action scenes.

Bale and Crowe are instead the film's biggest standouts, because they dare to supersize their performances.To summarise, Love and Thunder offers the usual lightning-streaked action and tossed-off gags, but this time, there's not enough heft behind the flashiness.My Rating: 4.5/10.",Helpful,•,19,17,pranayjalvi,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur62249628/?ref_=tturv_usr_183_t,9-Jul-22,

I love the humour Thor has but it used to be occasional, this film tries it every step of the way, endless jokes, the weird goats that literally lost it's comedic value by the second scream. Jorg was funny but also when you realise he made the movie he has a surprisingly big part.The story was just ok, chemistry was a bit off, you just didn't particularly care about the extras.

He should just be part of the big films and leave the solo ones.Sense Stan sadly passed I've found marvel films to have dropped off hard, this was a full on comedy and nothing like the original 3 where comedy was there it bits.

The attempt to re-hash the same elements in Love & Thunder however, backfired as the film has been deemed a disastrous blunder.Taika Waititi's brand of comedy blew out of proportion in Thor 4, with jokes coming up dry and REALLY overused. Multiple scenes were delegated to Thor's love triangle with Mjollnir and Stormbreaker, which failed to sell in the hundred times it was pushed down the audience's throats. Thor also, has been unfortunately relegated as the film's annoying clown, throwing more cringy punchlines than actual punches. His love story with Jane Foster was non appealing as well, due to the absence of chemistry and on screen fatigue. Between the uninspired comedy and cloying romance, airtime was wasted, airtime that could've been spent to further the limited positives the film had, such as more of Christian Bale's Gorr or Tessa Thompson's King Valkyrie. Shameful!Apart from the glaring mistake to turn Thor into the next The Fault In Our Stars, there remains a long list of mishaps. There is Russell Crowe's sheepish portrayal of Zeus, those UGLY costumes and a clichéd storyline to bring the film in deeper depths. The soundtrack, which put to good use some Guns N Roses songs, were good but feels EXACTLY like Ragnarok, diminishing the actual experience.Overall, Love and Thunder feels like its own parody. The film ultimately massacred Thor, its franchise's characters and the goodwill garnered by Ragnarok, by letting silliness take over to the point of annoyance. It wastes a terrific performance by Christian Bale and its relevance in the MCU is a serious question mark. This is easily Taika's worst film to date, and could be a mark that the MCU, is nearing its expiration date. 5/10.",Helpful,•,1,0,jaysanchu07,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur57103146/?ref_=tturv_usr_187_t,16-Jul-22,

He enlists the help of his friends, and a new unexpected hero. Unfortunately I really wasn't a fan of this film, and I just ended up getting really bored while watching it!Firstly, the cinematography was fairly decent but there wasn't much to talk about. I really enjoyed the black-and-white that was used in the film, it was tasteful and set an interesting tone. My main issue in terms of visuals comes with the CGI, which I thought was poor and some of the worst we've seen in the MCU so far. I'd expect more, as they obviously had the budget needed.The acting was good, and the characters continue to be as loveable as they always were. Chris Hemsworth is charismatic as Thor, and Natalie Portman really put her all into her performance, however I feel her character was rushed and wasted. Christian Bale was intriguing as the new villain but once again, I feel his backstory was rushed and felt incredibly basic.The humour for this film felt forced, and I much preferred Taika's approach in the previous film, Thor: Ragnarok (2017). This was a shame as I really enjoyed Waititi's previous works. A few of the jokes made me cringe, which most definitely wasn't what I expected.The music was fitting, but Guns N Roses seemed to be almost the only music used, therefore it got old quite quickly and had less of an effect as the film went on. I can't really remember the score, so I feel unable to comment on that.Lastly, the pacing was messy, and the tone was confusing. The film was both fast and slow, but It didn't balance it very well, and the film completely lost tension for me because of this.

3,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8310265/?ref_=tturv_perm_194,Assembly-line filmmaking at it again,"A lot of people expected the fourth and supposedly final Thor movie to be a passing of the hammer, and I don't blame them for detecting a pattern within the latest Marvel Universe titles -- at least the ones that concern the original Avengers:So far, Steve Rogers has handed his shield over to Sam ""The Falcon"" Wilson, we've seen a new Black Widow in the form of Yelena, and I'm pretty sure we got a new, younger Hawkeye in the Hawkeye TV show (I'm not gonna watch that), which is to say nothing of She-Hulk. And yes, the trailers for Taika Waititi's Thor: Love and Thunder made it seem as if Thor Odinson (Chris Hemsworth), who now seems kind of a joke, was going to surrender Mjölnir to Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), his bland love interest from the first two movies. Why her? Because it was in the comics, shush.Hell, pretty much all of these changes mirror the comic books. Passing a superhero mantle from one character to the next -- sometimes of a different race or gender -- is one of the medium's oldest traditions, so I could certainly see why people expected us to get a ""new"" Thor with this film (because apparently, first names are now mantles to be passed forth once a magical hammer abruptly repairs itself).However, after the latest Doctor Strange movie ventured into the Multiverse and changed very little in the process (despite adding such supposed game-changers as America Chavez and other stuff that likely won't be mentioned outside of the Doctor Strange or Scarlet Witch properties), I was genuinely thinking that the trailers were showing us an alternate reality; one that will only feature in this flick as a throwaway adventure and then never be acknowledged again. I won't reveal whether Mighty Thor is a permanent mainstay, but will report that I'm nevertheless troubled by the general directionlessness of Phase Four. What's this all for? What's the next Endgame? And why is the plot point ""Jane was snapped by Thanos and, due to a side effect of it, she now has cancer"" not an Onion headline?As the film begins, Thor is out adventuring with the Guardians of the Galaxy but is forced to reunite with Foster, Korg (Waititi's character from Ragnarok), and other older friends when Gorr the God Butcher (Christian Bale, who gets the best scenes of the film) starts exacting revenge on all ""gods"". That is, of course, the aliens that inspired the gods and goddesses of Earth mythologies (now including the likes of Zeus, as portrayed by Russell Crowe, who has the power to flick away Original Thor's robes and give us a good look at that regained ""god bod"" of his). He's not going around slaughtering deities willy-nilly.But in terms of more truly god-like (omnipotent) figures, the film also follows in the footsteps of Eternals by bringing in some more of Marvel Comics' more ""cosmic"" characters, specifically Eternity, who is a personification of the entire Universe and the source of Gorr's power -- so there's a decent explanation for why he would become something so impressive as a ""god"" butcher. Whether Eternity is still at the mercy of the Time Variance Authority or an angry witch who can ""destroy the Multiverse"" is anyone's guess. Could Konshu and Moon Knight rearrange the stars that comprise him at their own leisure? Who knows? It's useless to think too hard about Phase Four media.We also reunite with Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson), who is the ""king"" of New Asgard while Thor is off with the Guardians. Much fuss has been made about the fact that the film calls a female ruler a king, to which more smart-alecky viewers will explain that Asgard is a made-up fantasy world and so it's not our place to question how the word ""king"" is used in their pretend space-Viking culture. Funny that ""king"" is apparently the only Anglic linguistic unit that's used differently whereas the rest of their language mirrors ours pretty straightforwardly, but whatever. Go off, kween. I mean, qing!Another notable ""character"", I guess, is Mjölnir itself -- which, like I said, makes a very sudden return and seems more interested in Jane than Thor. Its relationship with Thor supplies many supposed laughs. Is it an old ex? Old roommate? Estranged kid? Pet? Simple: It's whatever joke Waititi felt for at the time.Thor: Love and Thunder is very much another Marvel movie. Like many of the post-Phase Three additions, however, it does mostly allow the director to keep his voice. Waititi isn't as unrestrained as Rami was with Multiverse of Madness -- which strayed a little too far from the MCU mold for some fanboys -- but he's possibly even wackier here than with Ragnarok, and we're treated to some wild, interesting-looking worlds (particularly the nightmarish pocket realm of Gorr).The film has enough zaniness to go around and I do like Bale's ""Come to Daddy""-inspired performance, but the VFX will often look incomplete, the dreaded Marvel comedy is worse than ever (capping many nice scenes with a cheeky wisecrack or silly character moment and so deflating them -- when it doesn't outright take older dramatic moments and treat them with all the dignity of a Seltzerberg parody), and some scenes are shot like some McDonald's tie-in commercial that managed to get the actors from the real movie involved. Much like fast food, however, you're not wrong for liking it; I'm not here to stop you. Having just seen the Tollywood epic RRR (which was both crazier and yet treated its characters with more dignity than this), my own patience with Hollywood is the lowest it's ever been, though I guess there's little to be done (even as the spread of RRR does re-ignite my faith).I just hope that you're watching this because you feel it genuinely enriches your incomprehensibly short time on this cosmic spec we so briefly inhabit -- the fact of which bolsters just how astronomically lucky you are to be alive to experience this age of art -- and not because you're too lazy and complacent to seek out whatever isn't Hollywood-approved product.

Overall, a movie that is poorly executed and cannot be saved with Thor's charm as it tries too hard to be funny with its meta jokes and constant volume of jokes (even when it mostly does not work) as this takes away from actually building a storyline that should really be developed, the relationship between Thor and Jane and how Thor comes to terms with being at the end of his character arc.Bad Direction (Really tries too hard to be funny and really is chaotic with trying to progress the story forward), Acting (Very Good from Chris Hemsworth (Really shows the experience he has with the character and effortlessly is able to command every scene he is in), Very Good from Christian Bale (Really shows the level of dedication he goes through as an actor as he is very captivating even in this villainous role), Pretty Good from Tessa Thompson (A good comedic relief that is menacing this time around and picks up where she left off from the previous film), Decent to Pretty Good from Taika Waititi (Plays the comedic relief character and has his ups and down given the script he wrote), Pretty bad from Russell Crowe (Really was not that convincing as Zeus as his acting was not there and his accent really did not sit right (which is surprising because this role was really written for him)), Decent to Pretty Good from Natalie Portman (Tries a bit too hard in this performance and really falters when it comes to the emotional side of the character (something that is surprising to me given her experience)), Very Good from Matt Damon (It was really funny how he is able to carry on his cameo from the previous movie and have such a small role even though how big he is), Pretty Bad to Decent from the rest of the cast (though Good from the Guardians of the Galaxy (really just stayed on brand for their characters given how short of screen time they had))), Pretty Bad Story (The overarching story was not that bad as it deals with Thor post Avengers as he is trying to come to terms with unfinished love, it is just not that well structured and the ending really is not that good; plus the general breaks from the narrative were really sloppy and not well executed (given that it was amateur style and it really was not that funny); also, for a movie that is meant to be about Thor and Jane's relationship it does a real bad job in helping develop it (we are kinda just thrown into what happens)), Pretty Bad Screenplay (The movie tries way too hard to be funny and because of it only 1/3 jokes really hit in the movie, plus most of the lines are really predictable and bland), Pretty Good Score/Soundtrack (though it is really annoying how much they play Sweet Child o' Mine throughout the movie), Good Cinematography, Decent Sound, Pretty Good Editing, Very Bad Visual Effects (Given the budget for the movie it is really alarming how unfinished and cartoonish it looks, it looks like they did not spend any effort to change this up before the release), Good Costumes (Did a good job in the Asgardian armor), Plot Structure was a real mess as the movie tries to follow a simplistic Marvel structure but tries to be quirky with it with different breaks and changes that it really hurts with the execution; also the rising action in the character arcs was really poorly done and the resolution really is thrown at the audience and the ending really takes away at what it was trying to build, Pacing was incredibly fast (and this is from the short runtime; the movie could have really benefited from 20-30 minutes added to help with developing and building character relationships), Build to climax was fine and pretty typical of Marvel; climax was incredible formulaic and predictable to any Marvel movie, Tone was pretty 80s and i think he did a good job in helping build this (but is too meta at times with how it is like this)",Helpful,•,0,2,cinemapersonified,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur82414298/?ref_=tturv_usr_200_t,13-Jun-23,

The whole movie is set up for this and I really didn't care. This is the fatal flaw of the movie, particularly since Endgame etc handled this aspect so well. The ending is simply meh and you don't really care.The strangest part about this movie is that it looks like its had a huge budget but some of it looks really bad and it has to be one of the least satisfying movies out there.

8,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8310654/?ref_=tturv_perm_218,A sparkling visual spectacle to be experience in theatres!,"Oscar-winning film-maker Taika Waititi's approach to superhero movies is directly in contrast with the edgier, darker turn most franchises have taken off late. While Robert Pattinson's smash hit ""Batman (2022)"" showcased a grittier, more ground-level caped crusader, ""Spiderman: No Way Home (2021)"" and ""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2022)"" ventured into the multiverse, opening up psychological thriller and horror elements for the MCU. Taika's unique blend of colorful storytelling and quirky comedy had single-handedly revived the Thor franchise which was down in the doldrums after the disastrous ""Thor: The Dark World (2013), infusing fresh new life and zest into the character with his quite fabulous ""Thor: Ragnarok (2017)"".While continuing in the same vein, leveraging his star man Chris Hemsworth's natural gift for sarcasm and comedy, Taika adds new elements to the arc in this edition, calling in not one, not two but three Oscar-winning performers in Natalie Portman, Christian Bale and Russel Crowe. The story follows Thor after the events of ""Avengers: Endgame (2019)"" with the God of Thunder seemingly reduced to a shadow of his former self, tired of his superhero adventures and suffering from a lack of purpose and meaning. He is, however, forced to take a break from this existential angst after Christian Bale's ""Gorr the God Butcher"" unleashes fresh hell on the universe, seemingly on a rampage to hunt down every God he can get his hands on.Armed with a mystical superweapon known as the Necrosword and the intensity and screen presence only an actor of Bale's caliber can bring in, ""Gorr"" is a fresh new interpretation of antagonists in the MCU and a fine adaptation of the classic character from the iconic ""Thor: God of Thunder (2013)"" comic. Waititi's storytelling brilliance doesn't stop there, as he warps in another fan-favorite comic book arc, that of ""The Mighty Thor (2016)"" where Thor's lady love Jane Foster becomes a female version of the God of Thunder and blends it neatly with the Gorr mythology.The writing, by Jennifer Kaytin Robinson and the director himself, is continuously engaging and is peppered with unexpected surprises to keep you on the edge of your seat. While the core story arc is painstakingly told, Taika pays close attention to expanding the universe as well, throwing up some juicy easter eggs that will be cannon fodder to the fans for months on end as well as teasing some universe-shattering extensions to the MCU in the mid and post-credits scene. That an upcoming story arc might feature one of my favorite comic actors in recent times was an absolute joy!Despite this apparent plethora of characters he has to work with, Waititi manages to keep his script tight and engaging and most importantly, short with a barely 2-hour-long runtime. With scenes involving Jeff Goldblum's ""Grandmaster"" and Peter Dinklage's ""Eitri"" cut at the editing table to accommodate this, there will be a significant section of the fandom that will wait with bated breath for the full directors cut version of this fine film. ""Thor: Love and Thunder"" may not rise to the groundbreaking levels of Ragnarok, but backed by solid performances, delivers wholesome entertainment and a visually grandiose theatre experience.

Love & Thunder clearly takes that position. This really makes me sad because I've always loved Thor as a character and all three of his previous films. This fourth one is a mess though. It tried so hard to be funny, but ended up just being silly. It honestly felt like a parody of itself at times. I couldn't take anything seriously because it didn't take itself seriously. The whole Zeus scene is just dumb. I miss the Thor we got in the first two films, and while Ragnarok was a big shift away from those, at least it was successfully funny.This film just went the wrong direction. Korg was not only unfunny this time around, he was completely unnecessary. I kept wondering why he was even there. He added nothing to the film. Valkyrie is fine, though also not super important. Thor, Jane, and Gorr seem to be the only characters that matter in this story. These three are easily the best parts of the film. While I wasn't a fan of Gorr as a villain for this film, Christian Bale gives one heck of performance. This is also the first Thor movie where I liked Jane Foster. I never felt like the romance between her and Thor had any chemistry, but at least her storyline is interesting this time.And it's almost impossible not to love Chris Hemsworth as Thor, even when he's starring in a bad movie. But I am ready, and it sounds like Chris Hemsworth is ready, for a serious, darker Thor experience. A Thor who is more viking warrior than goofball. Story wise, Thor 4 should have ditched this weak storyline and instead kept the Guardians of the Galaxy as part of the story throughout the movie. The tone of the film would have worked much better with this team than with the team we ended up with. Also, Thor needs Loki. The two of them together create magic.

While the plot is serious, and helps move along the MCU's overall plot, there are so many parts that are so ridiculous you can't help but enjoy the ride. Screaming goats anyone?The film picks up a few years after Thor left with the Guardians of the Galaxy at the end of Avengers Endgame. He spent those years regaining his physique, but set adrift mentally as he tries to process all the loss he had gone through over the last decade (or more when you count the blip that always confuses me regarding the Sacred Timeline).New Asgard seems to be doing well under the leadership of King Valkyrie. It has become a tourist attraction even showing a multitude of cruise ships docked at their port.After a few years, Thor finally parts ways with the Guardians to deal with his ""midlife crisis"". It was fun to see that team cameo in the first 20 or so minutes of battles and backstory, but Gamora was missing with no explanation.

She looks into the shattered hammer of Thor, which pieces are in New Asgard after Hela destroyed it in Thor: Ragnarok. She transforms into a fierce warrior that calls herself the Mighty Thor. Jane gets to do combat scenes, instead of being sidelined as the scientist. Together with Valkyrie, it was a lot of fun to see two strong female leads stand toe to toe with Thor, and then against Gorr (Christian Bale).I know this film didn't get as much praise as previous MCU entries, but I loved it. Russell Crowe as Zeus, Thor's unexpected but welcome nudity, those screaming goats, watching Jane and Thor's history from before the Infinity War, and the final battle involving the New Asgardian children makes for a lot fun. The making of documentary stated that they tried for a 1980s space adventure, and they pulled it off.Of course, Marvel fans must watch it because we watch everything, but the film does well for people who watch this as a stand alone.",Helpful,•,0,1,malmevik77,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur172500776/?ref_=tturv_usr_221_t,23-Sep-24,

3,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8328766/?ref_=tturv_perm_223,Not as great as Thor Ragnarok,"Who would've thought that the only MCU character (so far) to get 4 solo films would be Thor? The first Thor movie was an okay introduction and the second one was quite bland. In came Taika Waititi with Thor Ragnarok (2017), who made Thor a charismatic and fun character. Thor Ragnarok was no doubt one of the funniest and most enjoyable movies in the Thor franchise so far. It was no wonder that I was looking forward to Thor Love and Thunder when it was revealed Taika was returning as director. So did Thor: Love and Thunder deliver more fun or was this a big thundering step backwards?Firstly, Christian Bale was phenomenal as Gorr, the antagonist, in this film. He delivered an amazingly unsettling performance that made him incredibly creepy. He also delivers on the sorrowful moments as well that make him very sympathetic. Amazingly, he can be both frightening and yet kind of root for him. Natalie Portman finally returns to the Thor franchise as Jane Foster after being absent in Ragnarok. Her return is very ""mighty"" as she isn't just a doctor that is around but now a hero in her own right. It was great seeing her return and it's great to see that the chemistry between her and Thor (Chris) is still there. She has her struggles to deal with it and Natalie does an outstanding job of conveying the pain that she is going through. Chris and Tessa return as Thor and Valkyrie respectively and they are still great. Taika is still fun as the rock person Korg. Russell Crowe is pretty enjoyable to watch as Zeus as well. The whole cast did a great job in their performance.I also like the themes that are explored in the film. The exploration of love is a running arc for Thor throughout and I liked seeing him try to find ""himself"". There is also the theme of death in both Gorr and Jane's arc. It is handled wonderfully in both and I liked the resolution to it all as well. Legendary composer, Michael Giacchino, gives a colourful and bombastic score that works well for the movie. He also incorporates some great use of songs, similar to Guardians of the Galaxy, such as ""Sweet Child o' Mine"" by Guns N' Roses that just mesh well in the film. There are some pretty enjoyable action sequences but the most memorable is in the second act. There is a fight scene in the shadow realm that is just visually oozing with style.Unfortunately, the comedy in this movie does not work. I just found the comedy in this movie to not be that funny. Ragnarok had some laugh-out-loud moments but Love and Thunder just never get those types of moments. Additionally, a lot of the humour comes from Thor being an idiot. In Ragnarok, he was a lot more comedic but he had an arc and an important decision near the end. Here he is just a comedic idiot throughout and he never gets that sort of big decision as he did in Ragnarok. He does have an arc but it's very weak. It's genuinely a shame that the titular character has been reduced to a joke in his film. On that note, the comedy isn't as prevalent as it was in Ragnarok. Ragnarok was a comedy throughout with some strong serious moments sprinkled in. Love and Thunder mesh half a comedy and half serious and this tonal clash hurt the movie. The serious moments are when the movie is at its best but then a dumb gag happens and damages the moment.Christian Bale is the standout in this film but his character Gorr is barely even in the film. There is a whole middle act where he just isn't even there. He is also called the God butcherer but we don't even see him on screen actually butchering a god which is such a shame. Gorr needed more screen time to flesh out his character and show why he is a threat to the gods. They also don't show why Gorr killing gods is bad. There is one scene implying negative consequences but we don't see it either. This creates a problem where it feels like there isn't much at stake in the film even though there is supposed to be. The film just doesn't have much weight to it. In Ragnarok, Odin's death was meaningful, the brother's conversation was meaningful, Valkyrie's decision to help was meaningful, Thor embracing the God of Thunder was meaningful, and Thor letting Asgard blow up was meaningful. Love and Thunder just lacks a lot of these apart from one thing at the end that isn't even Thor.Overall, Love and Thunder is pretty disappointing. I expected something that was like Ragnarok but instead got something that felt like an attempt at Ragnarok. The comedy wasn't as funny this time and there are a lot more serious moments this time that is great but makes the comedy feel more jarring as it interrupts the moment. However, it is not downright terrible as there is enjoyment to be had here. It's just not a great Thor movie and definitely not as good as its predecessor. It's just okay and after over 20 MCU movies, okay just isn't good enough.",Helpful,•,1,1,MovieWarfare,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur112855274/?ref_=tturv_usr_223_t,12-Jul-22,

It was a more comedic but very sharp Thor film. Director Taika Waititi brought his very peculiar sense of humor to the MCU and it was refreshing. With Love and Thunder Waititi goes even further into comedy. So much so that the film feels like a self parody. I am all for silliness in superhero films but if you want an audience to be emotionally invested in a story you have to take it at least a little seriously. The film starts off as a full on comedy and the 3rd act gets serious but again, the shift in tone is jarring. Chris Hemsworth I'd good again as Thor and Natalie Portman is back as Jane Foster Thor's love interest. They have a good chemistry but again it's all so silly that when the film gets serious we should care more. Christian Bale plays Gorr, the God Butcher. He is the villain and is the best part of the film. A really good performance that is taken seriously but the rest of the characters are so busy being funny that it seems he belongs in a different film. Bale's great villain is sort of wasted. Is it entertaining? Yes. There are some really cool visually touches and yes some of the comedy works but I wish that the film would have been more of an adventure and less self parody....Grade: B-",Helpful,•,3,2,flicklover,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0266568/?ref_=tturv_usr_227_t,9-Jul-22,

There's a lot of ""could haves"" with this movie; it could have been funnier, could have been more sentimental, could have done with more spectacle. This is just another run-of-the-mill Marvel movie.Chris Hemsworth, Natalie Portman, and Christian Bale are all good here. Korg (Taika Waititi) is again the standout character, I love the comedic relief he brings. The movie starts off strong and ends strong but it's very messy throughout.Side note (and I'm not sure if this was just the theater I went to), but there were some weird audio issues like the sound mixing was off. The volume was very low at points like I couldn't hear a thing, and there were points where the music or the sound effects drowned out the dialogue and it was hard for me to hear what the characters were saying.Overall, not bad but no where near the level we've seen Marvel produce at.

5,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8311400/?ref_=tturv_perm_229,Marvel has stepped up its villain game lately.,"Taika Waititi amps up the zany craziness of Ragnarok to unbelievable levels in this film, both for better and for worse. The movie is often hilarious due to how unpredictably absurd it is, but sometimes suffers due to the overbearing need it seems to feel to always have jokes in every scene, regardless of whether they fit in with what's happening in the movie.But, this is nothing new for Marvel. I only bring it up because it happens far more often in this film than in any other Marvel outing.What is new in this film (and quite fresh) is the villain. Christian Bale gives a surprisingly both creepy and heartfelt performances as the God Butcher. Right from the opening we have a deep compassionate understanding for why he does what he does, and the conclusion of the story gives him a very satisfying conclusion for his journey as well.I just wish there was more of him. He gets a great introduction and a great ending in which compelling parallels are drawn between him and Thor, but throughout the rest of the movie he's just ""evil possessed guy."" The motivations are still there, but I wanted to see more of what he was doing and how his possession was affecting his mind or personality.I was worried about how Jane would be as ""Lady-Thor,"" and thankfully her presence in the movie is warranted. She's written into the story in a way that both makes sense and actually amplifies the emotional stakes, which are sadly nonexistent in a lot of these Marvel films.The action is mostly pretty good, but kind of a mixed bag. The camerawork and selective use of colors is fun and frenetic, but the overuse of CGI is sometimes far too noticeable and makes the movie look...cheap. Cheaper than any other Thor movie. Cheap is not a word I like to use when describing $200 million movies, but there isn't a better one to use for this.Endings are hard to write, and the ending of this film (no spoilers) both works and doesn't work. There's a satisfying payoff to the themes of love and loss, but at the very end the story asks us to care about Thor's relationship to a character who we have not seen and know nothing about.It's a sweet and charming ending, but it left me feeling...colder than I think the filmmakers wanted me to feel. And that's because they didn't put in any work throughout the movie to make me feel as satisfied as the characters in the movie are by the ending's outcome.I do recommend this film, for Christian Bale's performance and for Taika Waititi's very distinct (if flawed) absurd method of telling stories with a lot of humor and heart and ambition.

The lighthearted attitude worked fine with the serious attitude Thor has to the world and to himself. I said it a few times before - humor is probably the best cure for pompousness. But humor works best with set boundaries, most of these seem to be forgotten in this movie. And as far as I'm concerned it's plain shame since the serious part of the movie is one of the best I've seen in a long while. With Natalie Portman and Christian Bale both giving two of the best performances I've seen in superhero movies ever. And the rest of the leading roles didn't fall too far behind.But some of the jokes were so pathetic and pointless I felt like Taika Waititi got carried away by the idea of making Thor funny and pushed so far it almost ruined the movie. I get the point - most of the gods as depicted in our own myths are petty and even ridiculous, that would have been better pointed out in my humble opinion if they didn't play their roles as cartoons. Cartoons that look ridiculous and petty are almost commonplace. So - what's the point here did they feel the viewers wouldn't understand how pathetic the gods were if the roles were played straightforwardly? That means they wrote these roles all wrong. Did they feel there were too few jokes there - I don't know but if they did they were mistaken. There were already enough jokes as is, and still they kept piling more and more jokes - maybe they felt like the other part of the movie was too morbid so they wanted to counter it with an extra dose of jokes. That's the most likely explanation but in my book they were wrong to think so and that's mainly on Taika who lost a lot of points in my personal book for his poor sense of balance. I had to make a big conscience effort to ignore parts of this movie that practically made me cringe because the other parts were so good I didn't want anything to spoil them.Once again kudos to Natalie Portman and Christian Bale - they created real depth of character where only hints were written.",Helpful,•,0,3,ayoreinf,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur16320420/?ref_=tturv_usr_233_t,29-Jul-22,

Also, the reason I don't score this lower, is the fantastic performance by Christian Bale (nothing surprising here) and makes me sad that they wasted such a great villain in a movie like this, a great achievement not from the acting department made possible by Bale and Portman but also for the villain's background story, one of the richest I can recall from the MCU.Wasted potential, Marvel and Disney are sitting on their pile of money making this Phase 4 which has been overall very underwhelming, I know this won't happen, but they should either give audiences a break from Marvel or just reinvent the Universe and explore other characters and directions.",Helpful,•,9,6,thePopcornExplorer,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur36922988/?ref_=tturv_usr_235_t,8-Sep-22,

This time laughs and love in equal measure as action and universal travels, through Korg's unique style of storytelling.We find Thor where he was last seen, in the company of the Guardians, but a number of fatal occurences around the galaxy force a separation: the Guardians on one ship, Thor, Korg and Taylor Swift's goats through Stormbreaker's Bifrost portal to the New Asgard. Here, Thor, Valkyrie, and a new and improved Jane must confront a new evil: a powerful force intent on ridding the universe of Gods because of his heartbreaking circumstances. As always, Thor alone cannot conquer this evil so he must travel great distances to find an army.And here the religious zealots have a hissy fit, as the gods depicted are depraved, self-loving idiots led by an indulgent Zeus, played brilliantly by Russell Crowe (I'll have to wait until it is released on DVD to pause the line up of fabled gods to see if the more well-known ones are there, but I expect they are!).

The second half of it is more serious, with extra stakes, action sequences added and a few emotional moments. And that works too.What doesn't work is that the filmmakers haven't figured out a way to match these dark and funny bits together in a way that fits.

Weirdly enough they did this in the Amazon series The Boys as well - and that's a problem.The actors do look like they are still enjoying playing the characters. There were a few, such as the Guardians of The Galaxy, that should have stayed longer. And a few others, such as Korg and the Asguardian kids, that overstayed their welcome.

Think the last 2 movies including Dr Strange MOM has the same issue. These are movies that are created by their director to be completely 100% stand alone. Phase 4 of the MCU doesnt feel like the start of something new like phase 1 did.Will say that Hemsworth and Bale are still and always be the standout actors for the film. Its still so surprising that he has such perfect comedic timing, downside is that the script went 1 step to far in making Thor an Idiot. His whole arc from Thor 1 to Endgame that he went from the arrogant god to caring about everything and everyone, not letting collateral damage come to the forefront but within minutes of movie starting this has just been reverted. Bale as Gorr was great but earning the title of the God Butcher was a step to far, seems as though this was a Mordo set up from Doctor Strange level threat than actually the epic level threat. Only seeing the first god actually killed on screen was a disappointment. Thinking that Russel Crowe being signed on for 1 movie i hoped he might have been the shock that earnt him the title. Side note Russel Crowe as the campest version of Zeus ever was a great edition to the movie.Thinking this is where the movie falls down, the comedy in Thor: Ragnarok was perfection and trying to capture lighting twice doesnt always work out. There were some standout laugh out loud moment... Korg but there was a lot of jokes that didnt land. Either cringe or taking away from the story. This could have been a 2 part story which would have been even better. So much of the story was rushed, Janes redemption but also demise was so quick for such a poignant story line from the comics. Then the Goats, it was funny for the first 3 times then they needed to shut up!Im not going to say that i didnt enjoy the movie but i think i've fallen into the trap of overthinking what could be shown in the movie and ultimately being slightly disappointed.

But it can't quite decide what it wants to be.,"The first Thor (2011) is one of the best superhero films ever made. It had a clear storyline, great special effects, a great cast all around with a fine pick for the lead role (Chris Hemsworth), a stirring musical score, and a director (Kenneth Branagh) who knew how to lean right in to the mythical grandeur of the Norse gods. Yes, those were the days. Now in this fourth Thor film where are we? Norse god? No, a 'space Viking'. Serious warrior? More of a lovable doofus with muscles and a magical axe. It's all very entertaining and easy to watch -- things never drag, and visually, Love and Thunder is as striking as almost any thing Marvel has come up with. The Shadow Worls, the Hall of the Omnipotents, and the mysterious Eternity are terrifically well done things to look at. Also, for a cast that includes Natalie Portman and Christian Bale (and an over-the-top Russell Crowe cameo) how can you go wrong?So I enjoyed it. Go see it, you'll have a good time. But I also came away thinking that underneath the hood, this movie is fighting with itself, and for that I look right at director Taika Waititi. This thing can't decide what it wants to be. There's a lot of straight-on situational and romantic light comedy, which is fine, but the deep problem with that is that when things suddenly NEED to get serious (as they almost always should in superhero films; after all, the word 'super' is there for a reason, and saving the world/universe goes with the territory), it's hard to be convincing about the necessary shift in tone.Look at the other 'best' superhero films of recent years: the first Iron Man (2008). X-Men 2 (2003) and Days of Future Past (2014). Spider-Man 2 (2004) and Spider-Man No Way Home (2021). Wonder Woman (2017). The first Avengers (2012) and of course the big Infinity War/Endgame pair. What do these have in common? Yes, they have great characters and production values, but the ultimate key is that all of these films take themselves seriously, and that's how to make a fantasy world work. They lay out a storyline where the stakes are high, and then go at it straight on. If the movie can't even suspend its own disbelief while it's rolling then how can the audience do it? Waititi seems to want to have it both ways, or all ways, at once. Are we watching a sendup of superhero films or the real thing? I had the same issues with his Jojo Rabbit (2019), which was brilliant in certain ways but a chaotic mishmash of tone. It was less than the sum of its parts.Just to get the rest of my complaints out of the way, the first half-hour felt quite odd; the actors were delivering their lines in a quippy, offhand way as if they were in an episode of Seinfeld or Friends or whatever the recent equivalents are. And I was looking forward to seeing more of the lovable Korg and his off-center dialog that was such a fun part of Ragnarok, but it just fell flat this time. Tessa Thompson as Valkyrie was sadly underused and it looked almost as if she wished she was somewhere else.By this point, the Marvel film universe has almost completely disconnected from its original comics source material. (Case in point: it was very cool to see Eternity introduced as one of the Ultimate Powers of the universe -- he's rendered extremely well, just like the first appearance in the Doctor Strange comics. But he seems to be used as something like a wishing well, which is pretty trivial. Really, guys?) Right now it feels as if they are making up stuff as they go along, and interestingly, they are starting to run into the same storytelling complexity problems that the superhero comics have had for decades: continuity and retconning. If there's a Grand Plan for Phase 4 and 5 it's sure hard to see what it is.",Helpful,•,1,1,gcsman,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur66541531/?ref_=tturv_usr_257_t,16-Jul-22,

According to Chris Hemsworth, this movie was written by a 7 year old child but I had no idea that 7 year old children were allowed to be under the influence while writing scripts. Phase 4 has definitely been a stinking pile and this movie is the equivalent of throwing a thunder bomb to explode that pile and cover the audience with ""fun"", ""humor"" and ""entertainment"".The film is about... well its literaly just a bunch of excessive CGI mess, unbearable toddler humor and a plot that makes you want to scream like those goats. The only good part is the prologue with Christian Bale and after the MCU title begins to roll, everything feels like an incoherent parody where literally everything is poorly made whether its effects, choreography, dialogue, editing or pacing. Thor has definitely hit a new low as he has been degraded to a clown at a kids birthday party who is there to dress up in a cheap costume, talk to hammers, act like a bambling fool and get paid at the end of it all.You were excited for Guardians? How about 5 minutes. You wanted to see God Butcher in action? Forget about it. Instead, enjoy 2 hours of a talking rock. How did Mjolnir get restored? Who cares. How did Jane all of a sudden become a Woman Thor? Doesn't matter. Just stick your head inside a meat grinder and have fun because this is ""Entertainment"" from the comedic genius Taika. The plot actually invents new gimmicks that contradict themselves and the previous movies. I was hoping that at least the climax would pay off but instead, its kids fighting the villain with shiny plastic weapons and in the end, love is the answer.What's bewildering is how actors like Christian Bale, Matt Damon and Russel Crowe agreed to be in this garbagio; I guess the writing and CGI budgets were spent on their paychecks. People who watched this in the cinema should have been reimbursed and given money to see a therapist after experiencing this abomination.

He inhales pure Oxygen of NZ & keeps himself away from Disney's whitelines.Taika is a least funniest guy when he's doing sad scenes in his movies . Some say Taika was here before cgi happened. Taika has done more than 50+ cinemas which has broadened the minds of Kurosawa to Jodorowsky . Some say Taika was doing fortnight dance steps when he thought of ww2 & Jojo rabbit . Taika doesn't care about Taika's last said opinion. Truly a people's man. What a tank of comedy .

There were a lot of good moments and the movie is nice, but I felt it was geared too much towards 7-10 year olds. I felt like I am watching a Disney movie about a prince saving princess and the Worlds. There was not enough umph for adults. Some funny moments, a few cool cheesy fights, but felt lacking a bit in all of those. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't BAD, but wasn't as good as all previous ones.A side note would be about the 3D version which is what I watched. It was so ""bland"". If you are releasing a 3D movie and you know colors will not be as vibrant, why not crank it up a few notches for the 3d version, so that when you wear glasses it would show up at least somewhat colorful?!? Just common sense, no?As another side note, and this is just a personal opinion, the screaming goats maybe was not the brightest idea. AVX Dolby in theaters it was noise piercingly loud, I saw A LOT of people covering their ears.

I could not be more disappointed to find out that it took him here. With so much trauma, growth, and development being thrown out the window, this film turns our hero into a simplistic fool that cannot possibly have stood toe-to-toe with the Mad Titan and lived to tell the story. With a great director and great actors, you have to wonder how no one stopped the ridiculously childish humor, the unnatural pacing, and the story that goes from drama to comedy and repeats faster than you can blink. There are some redeeming features, such as some of the visuals and the little we see of Christian Bale (Gorr), but they are wasted underneath the burned memory of screaming goats.

Who would know?,"For those unaware of this perfectly ""normal"" mental condition, Thor is in love with his axe, and are afraid his axe is jealous of Mjølner, his ex. To complicate matters, Mjølner is no swinging by our old BRILLIANT scientist Jane Foster (Nat Portman with big abs), who NOW is The Might Thor. Why, you say? Well, sadly she has 4th stage termal cancer, but visiting Tønsberg, were Åsgård now is run by King (WHY not Queen??) Valkyrie, she spots the pieces of ol' Mjølner, and gets to be Thor. We will never know why. And Thor still loves the NEW Mighty Thor. So this is a love...triangle? Or something.Over to storytime? It's about a godkiller, cause a guy was upset with his God for destroying his family, so he found a sword called Kronos (That's actually the name of the God of War, which is pretty ironic), and starts killing Gods. All soon to the jam of several old hits from Guns N'Roses.In my ""review"" of Thor I mocked the story, talking about how stupid it would be if they got Greek mythology into MCU. BUT look no forther, cause, Thor, Mighty Thor Jane Foster, Korg AND Valkyrie travells to...someplace, and meets the mighty Zeus (fat Russell Crowe)....who is kind of a dick. But that part I liked, cause it's pure comedy. Specially the nice ladies around Zeus fainting when they see Thor's mighty....penis. That's F-U-N. Zeus lightning thingy looked btw incredible stupid, but hey, it's a cartoon movie.So, what did I think of Thor: Blood and Thunder? Oh, not Blood, but Love. It was ok'ish. Compared to the multiverse mess in other movies in stage 5 or whatever, it's a little funride, although director Taika Waititi really has to be hold in strains to keep from comedy which isnt so funny. Oh, we are going for a Guns N'Roses theme, so Heimdall's son wants to be called Axl, the biggest idiot of all vocalists.The movie doesnt do anything really to push the so-called MCU envelope any further. It's action in space, with comedy. I didn't shed a tear when someone ""important"" died, just whatever. BUT the most stupid thing comes in the end credits, when we get exposed to a new ""villain"". Yes, Thor will get hunted by Hercules, Zeus son. And he looked redicilous.",,,,,tindfoting,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur150749021/?ref_=tturv_usr_277_t,8-Sep-22,

He really pushes the silly humor aspect here, but for purposes of watching something fun on TV, it's quite good -- better than I was expecting actually. There are a number of running gags, and for my taste they all worked just fine. Christian Bale does fine work as villain-of-the-week Gorr. As endings go, this one is a bit unexpected, and it's pleasantly thoughtful (not just ""Kill the bad guy!"").If you look beneath the surface, there are actually some serious philosophical questions posed, not that they need to be considered (or even recognized) to enjoy the film -- they'll fly over the heads of many.1) If God (or gods) are ""good"", why are innocents allowed to suffer?2) Should one expect a ""reward"" in an afterlife?3) How should one make their life (and perhaps their death) meaningful?4) How does one come to terms with an inability to protect those you love?To be clear, I'm not saying this film is as good as Ragnarok, nor do I think it's a tearjerker in its serious moments. But such moments DO exist, and they're fairly well done. A longer (Director's) Cut might add to some characters, but we'd risk losing the carefully-controlled pacing. So it's fine as-is IMHO.Anyhow, I hope you understand that this film can be enjoyed on multiple levels. I give it seven (7) stars, which is currently above par.

3,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8399933/?ref_=tturv_perm_280,Thor: Love and Thunder Review,"Massive disappointment from both the MCU and Taika Waititi. Feels more like a parody of Thor: Ragnarok more than a continuation to that movie. Waititi's style works incredibly well for his other films but here it's just too much. The comedy undercuts almost every emotional moment and deflates almost any tension in every scene. The character development here for anyone who isn't Thor is underwhelming. Natalie Portman returns as Jane Foster and she feels more like a mandate from Disney to include her rather than Taika wanted to. I also don't think Portman is doing a great job here but the script she is given doesn't help her at all. Chris Hemsworth is good as Thor. It's clear Hemsworth is having a blast and his charisma kept me somewhat invested. Christian Bale's Gorr is a very mixed bag. On one hand you have a really fun, engaging, and great performance from Bale but that character of Gorr just isn't great. His origin is rushed and confusing before the film bizarrely chooses not to show him kill any gods besides one. A character called The God Killer only gets to kill one god on screen. Great job Marvel! The other actors like Tessa Thompson and Russell Crowe are doing a good job but their characters feel like an afterthought. The filmmaking here in general honestly feels a little bland. Taika's style is there but it feels awkward this time. The visual effects don't look great most of the time either however with the recent news about how Marvel treats it's VFX workers and how little time they have then it's understandable why they look incomplete. The film wasn't completely devoid of anything fun though. There were some fun sequences and fun jokes though. The black and white fight is very creative and fun to watch and The Rock at the end was pretty great. The rest of the jokes in this film really aren't that funny though. The screaming goats weren't funny the first time and they weren't funny the 15th time they made the joke. With the lackluster output that Phase 4 has given us, Marvel is in trouble right now if they don't course correct soon. If you enjoy Ragnarok then maybe you'll enjoy this but at the end of the day you can skip it.",,,,,theredsky,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur101697549/?ref_=tturv_usr_280_t,4-Aug-22,

There were some funny moments, some good action (though not really enough in my opinion), the cast did well, and the cinematography matched the caliber of Ragnarok.Small spoiler, but I did expect the Guardians to play a bigger role in this movie. They were hardly in it at all. I felt the movie would have been strong individually as well as to the MCU if they were a bigger part of the story.

6,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8547027/?ref_=tturv_perm_286,Gorr Never Butchers Any Gods,"Let's begin with what seems to be the biggest criticism of this film, the comedy. Having seen Taika Waititi's other films I felt fairly prepared for there to be a joke every 5 seconds, not every joke landed and there were moments when jokes didn't fit the tone but overall, I wasn't too distracted by it. I think this film failed in a lot of other ways but for me at least the overabundance of humour was passable.What I wasn't such a huge fan of was how rushed everything felt. Alright, maybe rushed is the wrong word, we spent ages watching the stuff that I was less interested in and then just skipped over the stuff I was there to see, namely Gorr. Gorr is the villain, played excellently by Christian Bale. Bale is one of the most talented actors alive so you would imagine he would be given time to show off, for some bizarre reason though, we never see Gorr the God Butcher, Butcher any gods. He kills one early on and then is relegated to off screen evil doing, while we instead follow Thor and his gang on their merry adventures. Whenever Gorr was on screen I was excited, but they only gave him like 20 minutes of screentime. Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Natalie Portman as Thor 2 and Tessa Thompson as Valkyrie were all good, but come on. None of them come near to the charisma that Bale brings to the table. So not only did the film just skip over all the most interesting parts, which reportedly were filmed but just not used in the final cut, but then the rest of the film is just a mildly entertaining comedy? I was disappointed.The best scene, that single handedly dragged this film up from a 5 to a 6 for me, was when Thor fights Gorr on a planet with no colour. The way this was shot was so different from the usual MCU fodder and actually seeing Gorr in his element was great. If the film as a whole had been as inventive and interesting as this one scene then I might have had a brilliant time. It wasn't and I didn't so before I finish I'll just throw in a few nitpicks just to kick this film while it's down.When Thor and friends seek help from other gods, the majority of the gods feel like really boring designs, they could have had so much crazy stuff here but instead just had a couple weird designs and played the rest safe. There are two goats, they annoy me and aren't funny. Thor's outfit is actually painful to look at. Just a terrible design. Korg is treated as a main character, he was better in the first when we just got small bursts of him, here it starts feeling like too much at points.This film isn't terrible but it just lacks in a lot of places, the ending was nice enough and certainly tried to get you more emotional than anything else in the film but it was difficult to feel for the characters after an hour thirty of them just quipping. Also all emotional value was ruined by the post credits scene.",,,,,emryse,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur128569426/?ref_=tturv_usr_286_t,15-Sep-22,

However, he did not expect that his ex-girlfriend Jane Foster had become Mighty Thor with his Mjolnir. Together with Valkyrie and Korg, they go on a cosmic journey to confront Gorr.Thor: Love and Thunder is the 4th film of Thor's journey in the MCU and is a large solo film series in the MCU. This film still seems to use the same formula from Ragnarok, starting in terms of comedy, colorful visuals and flexible acting. The film is set after the events of Endgame. However, it is really unfortunate. Despite thepost-Endgame story, there are many changes from Thor's character development in this film which is much looser and has a great sense of humor. This is a bit of a weakness of this film even though this film is quite entertaining. Too much comedy is brought and the humorous impression of Thor has an impact on the limited character development in this film. Starting from Gorr the God Butcher who should get a large portion as the main villain. Gorr's appearance here is quite extraordinary, but the lack of performance in the film does not give a scary impression in the movie and even sympathy for his motivation is not felt. Then Jane Foster's transformation into Mighty Thor is also a pity. Supposedly, we can see Jane's problem here which can be explored more deeply. Likewise with the presence of Zeus who actually makesadi boast in this film.Overall, the film performs entertainingly . It has a story premise that is less convincing even though it has brought Thor's biggest enemy. The conflict of the story is less deep. There are many conflicts that should be able to be explored far away. Many plot holes occur with the impression that everyone has understood the world of Thor. Both stories and conflicts are less capable of being densely constructed and fused. Love and Thunder became a rock n roll film for me with a memorable rendition of GnR's skirt music.

And I am so happy to report that he has done it again with ""Thor: Love and Thunder""! I still love his comedic take on Thor so much, it still works so well for me, and I was thrilled to see that he finally was able to make the Jane Foster character, as well as her relationship to Thor, work so well and come off as so likable! I finally cared about the relationship between Thor and Jane as well (for the first time in the MCU); I was so happy to see that the elements that didn't work for me in the past were able to become something so much more in this film, and I fully attribute that to Taika's skills at writing great characters and great relationships! He is especially skilled at blending his signature style of silly comedy with some heartfelt emotion, and that is on full display here! There are moments where the film had me laughing so hard, and then in the next scene feeling like I was on the verge of tears... and it didn't feel forced at all!This movie just made me feel good! Throughout the whole film I was smiling, and by the end even despite the few flaws it has, I left the theatre feeling happy and much better than I did when I went in. It has such lighthearted fun, while also dealing with dark subject material, but the playful way Waititi tells his stories with so much heart and humour just makes you feel so good while watching... it truly is such a blast! I love this film to death, it feels like an 80s action sci-fi space opera crossed with a rom-com, with a little bit of rock ballad mixed in! And it felt like such a perfect tone for Thor! The movie is a beautifully told love story about finding meaning and living in the moment with a lot of emotion and catharsis focusing on themes of change, spirituality and religion, and as I mentioned, finding meaning in one's self. I thought Taika wrote a wonderful story, brimming with so much great humour (if you liked the comedy style in Ragnarok.... you'll love this!) and lots of awesome action and emotion. I just can't get over how well it all worked together, I fell head over heels for it!Like I continue to say, I love how Waititi blends comedy and emotion. Despite how silly the movie can be (and I love that), it never sacrifices the story for a joke. In fact, the jokes and silliness seem to have an underlying thematic exploration beneath them; we start to see Thor as someone who uses humour to hide behind his problems and insecurities. The film really did a good job at articulating Thor's inner pain through the humour, it was brilliant. We see characters express themselves in deeper ways through comedy than they could normally. Plus, I just really like Waititi's comedic style and tone, and find it's unlike anything else we are used to seeing in comedy currently. It works so well for me... every joke and gag here had me laughing out loud. And the emotion of the film is so poignant too, from the incredible opening scene with Gorr, to small dialogue scenes between Thor and Jane (I loved those moments, they were quite well written). It hits so well and with so much impact, and doesn't feel forced or tonally off in any way... Taika just has a gift for blending these tones!It shouldn't be a stretch to say that I felt this film was written so cleverly and with so much heart! I thought it told a great story with some impactful meaning and some awesome comedy. It could be cheesy at times, but I loved that, it felt like it matched that 80s rock ballad style perfectly! There were also so many storytelling decisions that I found to be quite bold for Marvel. Heck, the film opens with a scene discussing religion, faith, and the notion of gods in such an intelligent way, questioning whether gods are worth worshiping, while also establishing our fantastic villain, Gorr the God Butcher. I truly found him to be quite sympathetic, thanks to some great writing, especially in that first scene, as well as Christian Bale's incredible performance. It's not an understatement to say he delivered one of the best performances we have seen in the MCU, and he has become one of my favourite villains among Thanos, Killmonger, Loki and Wanda! Bale commands the screen, he was menacing and terrifying, and yet still had moments where he was really funny, on top of showing an emotional/sympathetic side! He had this Pennywise-like sort of cheesy, creepy vibe to him which I loved; I just couldn't get enough of Gorr and Bale's performance. He also looked phenomenal too! But I think that leads to my biggest complaint for the film... we only get a few Gorr scenes, and while Bale kills it every time, I could've used a little more! And that brings me to my next slight issue... structurally the movie does feel a little messy at times, and scenes feel very rushed at the beginning. You can tell it was really cut down, so much like with Gorr, I would've loved to see a few more scenes added in, the movie felt like it needed an extra 15 minutes at least. It still works quite well as a final product, but I found myself longing for more and feeling like we were missing scenes here or there at many times throughout the film. An extended cut honestly wouldn't hurt the film, and because I loved literally every scene we got in the movie, I'd be so happy to see even more!The soundtrack in this movie was phenomenal. I loved Giacchino's score, and the heavy metal version of the Marvel fanfare was also really cool! But my absolute favourite element of it was the Guns 'n Roses focus! Waititi made great use of classic songs such as ""Sweet Child O' Mine"", ""Welcome to the Jungle"" and ""Paradise City"". I thought it was really cool to have to focus on one band, as it made the movie sound more cohesive rather than jumping around to different sounding music. It did however use a few other songs, and I love the use of Enya's ""Only Time"" and ABBA's ""Our Last Summer"" over some really fun montages, the latter of which is what really made me care about Thor and Jane's relationship. I love how we got to look back at a time when they were in love, and see all the mundane activities they got up to instead of just the superhero conflict stuff we saw in the last movies. The stripped down approach helped to make me finally understand why the relationship was so important to Thor, and seeing him reconnect with and come to terms with his current relationship status with Jane was quite perfect. I also loved how they compared this relationship to Thor's relationships with his ex-hammer, Mjolnir, and his current axe, Stormbreaker, and the way they personified the weapons was so funny to me! Chris Hemsworth really sold those scenes so well too! In fact, he sold everything Thor did in this movie perfectly, from the great action to the hilarious comedic moments. I really felt Thor's pain as he was looking for purpose in the universe. And did he ever look the part here... his muscles are HUGE. He is just perfect in this role and I love how he has evolved the character over the years! His chemistry with Natalie Portman here was phenomenal too, again, this is the best they've ever been together. I loved Jane's story, and while it was so cool to see her wield Mjolnir and take up the Mighty Thor mantle, it was the underlying emotional elements that worked best for me!Now, putting aside everything else, I truly enjoyed this film purely for how it made me feel. Because it made me feel good! I went in expecting a good time, and not only did I get that, but it actually improved how I was feeling as I watched the movie; I left feeling better than I did before I saw it! It just made me happy, it made me smile and laugh so much, and even the emotion found a way to touch me in really profound ways. So yes, I may be more forgiving of this movie than some, but for me it just worked so well and really made me feel good! So if you want a fun time at the movies that makes you feel good, I'd highly recommend ""Thor: Love and Thunder"". I love it to death, and honestly I have no specific reason why, I just felt so good after watching it and find it so unashamedly loveable! It may not be for everyone as it does use a niche style of comedy, but it sure worked so well for me! I just loved how happy it made me. It's unlike anything else in the MCU and really treads some new ground, so thank you, Taika Waititi, for this movie that brought a little extra light into my life! And genuinely, can we get Thor 5 like right now? I need to see it so badly!

Who would know?,"For those unaware of this perfectly ""normal"" mental condition, Thor is in love with his axe, and are afraid his axe is jealous of Mjølner, his ex. To complicate matters, Mjølner is no swinging by our old BRILLIANT scientist Jane Foster (Nat Portman with big abs), who NOW is The Might Thor. Why, you say? Well, sadly she has 4th stage termal cancer, but visiting Tønsberg, were Åsgård now is run by King (WHY not Queen??) Valkyrie, she spots the pieces of ol' Mjølner, and gets to be Thor. We will never know why. And Thor still loves the NEW Mighty Thor. So this is a love...triangle? Or something.Over to storytime? It's about a godkiller, cause a guy was upset with his God for destroying his family, so he found a sword called Kronos (That's actually the name of the God of War, which is pretty ironic), and starts killing Gods. All soon to the jam of several old hits from Guns N'Roses.In my ""review"" of Thor I mocked the story, talking about how stupid it would be if they got Greek mythology into MCU. BUT look no forther, cause, Thor, Mighty Thor Jane Foster, Korg AND Valkyrie travells to...someplace, and meets the mighty Zeus (fat Russell Crowe)....who is kind of a dick. But that part I liked, cause it's pure comedy. Specially the nice ladies around Zeus fainting when they see Thor's mighty....penis. That's F-U-N. Zeus lightning thingy looked btw incredible stupid, but hey, it's a cartoon movie.So, what did I think of Thor: Blood and Thunder? Oh, not Blood, but Love. It was ok'ish. Compared to the multiverse mess in other movies in stage 5 or whatever, it's a little funride, although director Taika Waititi really has to be hold in strains to keep from comedy which isnt so funny. Oh, we are going for a Guns N'Roses theme, so Heimdall's son wants to be called Axl, the biggest idiot of all vocalists.The movie doesnt do anything really to push the so-called MCU envelope any further. It's action in space, with comedy. I didn't shed a tear when someone ""important"" died, just whatever. BUT the most stupid thing comes in the end credits, when we get exposed to a new ""villain"".

He really pushes the silly humor aspect here, but for purposes of watching something fun on TV, it's quite good -- better than I was expecting actually. There are a number of running gags, and for my taste they all worked just fine. Christian Bale does fine work as villain-of-the-week Gorr. As endings go, this one is a bit unexpected, and it's pleasantly thoughtful (not just ""Kill the bad guy!"").If you look beneath the surface, there are actually some serious philosophical questions posed, not that they need to be considered (or even recognized) to enjoy the film -- they'll fly over the heads of many.1) If God (or gods) are ""good"", why are innocents allowed to suffer?2) Should one expect a ""reward"" in an afterlife?3) How should one make their life (and perhaps their death) meaningful?4) How does one come to terms with an inability to protect those you love?To be clear, I'm not saying this film is as good as Ragnarok, nor do I think it's a tearjerker in its serious moments. But such moments DO exist, and they're fairly well done. A longer (Director's) Cut might add to some characters, but we'd risk losing the carefully-controlled pacing. So it's fine as-is IMHO.Anyhow, I hope you understand that this film can be enjoyed on multiple levels. I give it seven (7) stars, which is currently above par.

Feels more like a parody of Thor: Ragnarok more than a continuation to that movie. Waititi's style works incredibly well for his other films but here it's just too much. The comedy undercuts almost every emotional moment and deflates almost any tension in every scene. The character development here for anyone who isn't Thor is underwhelming. Natalie Portman returns as Jane Foster and she feels more like a mandate from Disney to include her rather than Taika wanted to. I also don't think Portman is doing a great job here but the script she is given doesn't help her at all. Chris Hemsworth is good as Thor. It's clear Hemsworth is having a blast and his charisma kept me somewhat invested. Christian Bale's Gorr is a very mixed bag. On one hand you have a really fun, engaging, and great performance from Bale but that character of Gorr just isn't great. His origin is rushed and confusing before the film bizarrely chooses not to show him kill any gods besides one. A character called The God Killer only gets to kill one god on screen. Great job Marvel! The other actors like Tessa Thompson and Russell Crowe are doing a good job but their characters feel like an afterthought. The filmmaking here in general honestly feels a little bland. Taika's style is there but it feels awkward this time. The visual effects don't look great most of the time either however with the recent news about how Marvel treats it's VFX workers and how little time they have then it's understandable why they look incomplete. The film wasn't completely devoid of anything fun though. There were some fun sequences and fun jokes though. The black and white fight is very creative and fun to watch and The Rock at the end was pretty great. The rest of the jokes in this film really aren't that funny though. The screaming goats weren't funny the first time and they weren't funny the 15th time they made the joke. With the lackluster output that Phase 4 has given us, Marvel is in trouble right now if they don't course correct soon.

6,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8547027/?ref_=tturv_perm_286,Gorr Never Butchers Any Gods,"Let's begin with what seems to be the biggest criticism of this film, the comedy. Having seen Taika Waititi's other films I felt fairly prepared for there to be a joke every 5 seconds, not every joke landed and there were moments when jokes didn't fit the tone but overall, I wasn't too distracted by it. I think this film failed in a lot of other ways but for me at least the overabundance of humour was passable.What I wasn't such a huge fan of was how rushed everything felt. Alright, maybe rushed is the wrong word, we spent ages watching the stuff that I was less interested in and then just skipped over the stuff I was there to see, namely Gorr. Gorr is the villain, played excellently by Christian Bale. Bale is one of the most talented actors alive so you would imagine he would be given time to show off, for some bizarre reason though, we never see Gorr the God Butcher, Butcher any gods. He kills one early on and then is relegated to off screen evil doing, while we instead follow Thor and his gang on their merry adventures. Whenever Gorr was on screen I was excited, but they only gave him like 20 minutes of screentime. Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Natalie Portman as Thor 2 and Tessa Thompson as Valkyrie were all good, but come on. None of them come near to the charisma that Bale brings to the table. So not only did the film just skip over all the most interesting parts, which reportedly were filmed but just not used in the final cut, but then the rest of the film is just a mildly entertaining comedy? I was disappointed.The best scene, that single handedly dragged this film up from a 5 to a 6 for me, was when Thor fights Gorr on a planet with no colour. The way this was shot was so different from the usual MCU fodder and actually seeing Gorr in his element was great. If the film as a whole had been as inventive and interesting as this one scene then I might have had a brilliant time. It wasn't and I didn't so before I finish I'll just throw in a few nitpicks just to kick this film while it's down.When Thor and friends seek help from other gods, the majority of the gods feel like really boring designs, they could have had so much crazy stuff here but instead just had a couple weird designs and played the rest safe. There are two goats, they annoy me and aren't funny. Thor's outfit is actually painful to look at. Just a terrible design. Korg is treated as a main character, he was better in the first when we just got small bursts of him, here it starts feeling like too much at points.This film isn't terrible but it just lacks in a lot of places, the ending was nice enough and certainly tried to get you more emotional than anything else in the film but it was difficult to feel for the characters after an hour thirty of them just quipping.

However, he did not expect that his ex-girlfriend Jane Foster had become Mighty Thor with his Mjolnir. Together with Valkyrie and Korg, they go on a cosmic journey to confront Gorr.Thor: Love and Thunder is the 4th film of Thor's journey in the MCU and is a large solo film series in the MCU. This film still seems to use the same formula from Ragnarok, starting in terms of comedy, colorful visuals and flexible acting. The film is set after the events of Endgame. However, it is really unfortunate. Despite thepost-Endgame story, there are many changes from Thor's character development in this film which is much looser and has a great sense of humor. This is a bit of a weakness of this film even though this film is quite entertaining. Too much comedy is brought and the humorous impression of Thor has an impact on the limited character development in this film. Starting from Gorr the God Butcher who should get a large portion as the main villain. Gorr's appearance here is quite extraordinary, but the lack of performance in the film does not give a scary impression in the movie and even sympathy for his motivation is not felt. Then Jane Foster's transformation into Mighty Thor is also a pity. Supposedly, we can see Jane's problem here which can be explored more deeply. Likewise with the presence of Zeus who actually makesadi boast in this film.Overall, the film performs entertainingly . It has a story premise that is less convincing even though it has brought Thor's biggest enemy. The conflict of the story is less deep. There are many conflicts that should be able to be explored far away. Many plot holes occur with the impression that everyone has understood the world of Thor. Both stories and conflicts are less capable of being densely constructed and fused. Love and Thunder became a rock n roll film for me with a memorable rendition of GnR's skirt music.

9,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8322696/?ref_=tturv_perm_299,A feel good superhero comedy!,"It's no secret that I loved what Taika Waititi did with ""Thor: Ragnarok""; he made me fall in love with Thor again after really getting bored of the character in ""Thor: The Dark World"". And I am so happy to report that he has done it again with ""Thor: Love and Thunder""! I still love his comedic take on Thor so much, it still works so well for me, and I was thrilled to see that he finally was able to make the Jane Foster character, as well as her relationship to Thor, work so well and come off as so likable! I finally cared about the relationship between Thor and Jane as well (for the first time in the MCU); I was so happy to see that the elements that didn't work for me in the past were able to become something so much more in this film, and I fully attribute that to Taika's skills at writing great characters and great relationships! He is especially skilled at blending his signature style of silly comedy with some heartfelt emotion, and that is on full display here! There are moments where the film had me laughing so hard, and then in the next scene feeling like I was on the verge of tears... and it didn't feel forced at all!This movie just made me feel good! Throughout the whole film I was smiling, and by the end even despite the few flaws it has, I left the theatre feeling happy and much better than I did when I went in. It has such lighthearted fun, while also dealing with dark subject material, but the playful way Waititi tells his stories with so much heart and humour just makes you feel so good while watching... it truly is such a blast! I love this film to death, it feels like an 80s action sci-fi space opera crossed with a rom-com, with a little bit of rock ballad mixed in! And it felt like such a perfect tone for Thor! The movie is a beautifully told love story about finding meaning and living in the moment with a lot of emotion and catharsis focusing on themes of change, spirituality and religion, and as I mentioned, finding meaning in one's self. I thought Taika wrote a wonderful story, brimming with so much great humour (if you liked the comedy style in Ragnarok.... you'll love this!) and lots of awesome action and emotion. I just can't get over how well it all worked together, I fell head over heels for it!Like I continue to say, I love how Waititi blends comedy and emotion. Despite how silly the movie can be (and I love that), it never sacrifices the story for a joke. In fact, the jokes and silliness seem to have an underlying thematic exploration beneath them; we start to see Thor as someone who uses humour to hide behind his problems and insecurities. The film really did a good job at articulating Thor's inner pain through the humour, it was brilliant. We see characters express themselves in deeper ways through comedy than they could normally. Plus, I just really like Waititi's comedic style and tone, and find it's unlike anything else we are used to seeing in comedy currently. It works so well for me... every joke and gag here had me laughing out loud. And the emotion of the film is so poignant too, from the incredible opening scene with Gorr, to small dialogue scenes between Thor and Jane (I loved those moments, they were quite well written). It hits so well and with so much impact, and doesn't feel forced or tonally off in any way... Taika just has a gift for blending these tones!It shouldn't be a stretch to say that I felt this film was written so cleverly and with so much heart! I thought it told a great story with some impactful meaning and some awesome comedy. It could be cheesy at times, but I loved that, it felt like it matched that 80s rock ballad style perfectly! There were also so many storytelling decisions that I found to be quite bold for Marvel. Heck, the film opens with a scene discussing religion, faith, and the notion of gods in such an intelligent way, questioning whether gods are worth worshiping, while also establishing our fantastic villain, Gorr the God Butcher. I truly found him to be quite sympathetic, thanks to some great writing, especially in that first scene, as well as Christian Bale's incredible performance. It's not an understatement to say he delivered one of the best performances we have seen in the MCU, and he has become one of my favourite villains among Thanos, Killmonger, Loki and Wanda! Bale commands the screen, he was menacing and terrifying, and yet still had moments where he was really funny, on top of showing an emotional/sympathetic side! He had this Pennywise-like sort of cheesy, creepy vibe to him which I loved; I just couldn't get enough of Gorr and Bale's performance. He also looked phenomenal too! But I think that leads to my biggest complaint for the film... we only get a few Gorr scenes, and while Bale kills it every time, I could've used a little more! And that brings me to my next slight issue... structurally the movie does feel a little messy at times, and scenes feel very rushed at the beginning. You can tell it was really cut down, so much like with Gorr, I would've loved to see a few more scenes added in, the movie felt like it needed an extra 15 minutes at least. It still works quite well as a final product, but I found myself longing for more and feeling like we were missing scenes here or there at many times throughout the film. An extended cut honestly wouldn't hurt the film, and because I loved literally every scene we got in the movie, I'd be so happy to see even more!The soundtrack in this movie was phenomenal. I loved Giacchino's score, and the heavy metal version of the Marvel fanfare was also really cool! But my absolute favourite element of it was the Guns 'n Roses focus! Waititi made great use of classic songs such as ""Sweet Child O' Mine"", ""Welcome to the Jungle"" and ""Paradise City"". I thought it was really cool to have to focus on one band, as it made the movie sound more cohesive rather than jumping around to different sounding music. It did however use a few other songs, and I love the use of Enya's ""Only Time"" and ABBA's ""Our Last Summer"" over some really fun montages, the latter of which is what really made me care about Thor and Jane's relationship. I love how we got to look back at a time when they were in love, and see all the mundane activities they got up to instead of just the superhero conflict stuff we saw in the last movies. The stripped down approach helped to make me finally understand why the relationship was so important to Thor, and seeing him reconnect with and come to terms with his current relationship status with Jane was quite perfect. I also loved how they compared this relationship to Thor's relationships with his ex-hammer, Mjolnir, and his current axe, Stormbreaker, and the way they personified the weapons was so funny to me! Chris Hemsworth really sold those scenes so well too! In fact, he sold everything Thor did in this movie perfectly, from the great action to the hilarious comedic moments. I really felt Thor's pain as he was looking for purpose in the universe. And did he ever look the part here... his muscles are HUGE. He is just perfect in this role and I love how he has evolved the character over the years! His chemistry with Natalie Portman here was phenomenal too, again, this is the best they've ever been together. I loved Jane's story, and while it was so cool to see her wield Mjolnir and take up the Mighty Thor mantle, it was the underlying emotional elements that worked best for me!Now, putting aside everything else, I truly enjoyed this film purely for how it made me feel. Because it made me feel good! I went in expecting a good time, and not only did I get that, but it actually improved how I was feeling as I watched the movie; I left feeling better than I did before I saw it! It just made me happy, it made me smile and laugh so much, and even the emotion found a way to touch me in really profound ways. So yes, I may be more forgiving of this movie than some, but for me it just worked so well and really made me feel good! So if you want a fun time at the movies that makes you feel good, I'd highly recommend ""Thor: Love and Thunder"". I love it to death, and honestly I have no specific reason why, I just felt so good after watching it and find it so unashamedly loveable! It may not be for everyone as it does use a niche style of comedy, but it sure worked so well for me! I just loved how happy it made me. It's unlike anything else in the MCU and really treads some new ground, so thank you, Taika Waititi, for this movie that brought a little extra light into my life! And genuinely, can we get Thor 5 like right now? I need to see it so badly!

Taika Waititi's humor, although not consistently hitting the mark, brought a light and entertaining tone to the MCU. The characters, especially Thor, the Guardians of the Galaxy, Jane Foster, and Korg, showcased undeniable charisma, contributing to the film's appeal. Skillful editing kept the pace smooth, allowing me to lose track of time, and the narrative arc around Jane Foster added a compelling emotional dimension.On the flip side, the plot felt somewhat formulaic, lacking the innovation of ""Thor: Ragnarok"" and unfolding predictably. There was a noticeable missed opportunity in exploring more depth in the main storyline and secondary characters like Almighty Thor.

6,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8311437/?ref_=tturv_perm_304,"Serviceable ""fourquel"" has Waititi's style but lacks purpose","I've always found Thor to be one of the weaker A-list MCU characters, but I appreciated Taika Waititi's vision for ""Thor: Ragnarok."" His quirky humor, great soundtracks, and attention to deft pacing and comedic timing made that film, while far from perfect, a unique standout that helped create a fresher vision of Thor as a character that not only would ultimately set him up for ""Infinity War"" and ""Endgame,"" but provide a blueprint for how directors could still put at least a somewhat unique stamp of their own on the Marvel formula. I'm not necessarily a hardcore fan of Waititi (""Jojo Rabbit"" was not for me,) but still appreciate his idiosyncrasies and interests in using humor and irony to pepper stories in unexpected and distinct ways. With that said, given that I enjoyed ""Ragnarok"" and also love Christian Bale (who plays Gorr, the film's villain,) I was hoping this sequel would deliver. While it's not terrible by any means and a fine way to kill two hours on a hot summer day, it's much more forgettable than its predecessor and adds vanishingly little to the MCU as a whole.The film deals with Thor's post-""Endgame"" whereabouts, including his partnership with Jane Foster (the ""Mighty Thor.) Its primary plot line, however, centers around him and Jane having to rescue a group of kidnapped local children from the wrath of Gorr, a vengeful father who wants to kill all the gods. As anyone who saw ""Ragnarok"" and remembers its light, breezy, irreverent tone can imagine, the tone is emblematic of that film. Yet while the film can sometimes be entertaining, it just doesn't work anywhere near as well as ""Ragnarok."" The humor doesn't feel fresh and instead feels rather forced, the character development is surprisingly rather weak, and the stakes never feel convincing. There are plenty of ways to do comparatively lower-stakes MCU movies in a more interesting way (like ""Shang-Chi,"") but instead this feels more like a Disney+ miniseries concept than a theatrical movie in terms of plot depth and relative impact to the greater MCU. Even its themes of romance and the impact of interpersonal relations on the psyche feel blandly explored, and the emotional core there is in the story feels rather weak compared to ""Ragnarok."" To Waititi's credit, the film is deftly paced at a notch under 2 hours managing to never feel too long nor too short, he does serve up a good soundtrack (highlights include classic Guns and Roses songs,) and a few scenes have CGI visuals that are a cut above your average Marvel movie. Yet these stronger elements unfortunately don't match up against the film's relative sense of purpose or even a strong, original plot. Christian Bale is very good, unrecognizable, and menacing as Gorr, but he's almost criminally underused in the story, to the detriment of the broader narrative as a whole.

Unfortunately, this installment of the franchise is not very good, and simply lacks in areas the other Thor Films didn't. So Let's review ""Thor:Love and Thunder"".The problem with this film is it becomes too jokey, there's too many silly things that happen that it feels more like a Parody then a film itself, it doesn't have to take itself seriously, but when the film is too silly it just doesn't work. Much like the screaming sheep, and Thor doing the splits inbetween two trucks. It's funny because it's ludicrous, it's not funny because it's clever.Another thing is the Villain. He has a nice portrayal at the start but it then goes SiDeWaYs. He is made out to be a strong force to be reckoned with, but in reality he's a stale character with not much to do. And it becomes disappointing for the viewer.There are positives to take from the villain, was his daughter's death, it's a nice moment to sympathise with him, and it works well into the story. It shows her importance to him, and when she's gone it shows the effects and how he's feeling without her. It creates for this vengeful mission that went downhill in about 5 Minutes.Jane was also wasted. And her being like Thor really doesn't work. She was the love interest, and it takes away any potential tension the film has because it's played off for laughs rather then an exciting and impactful sequence. Also, Jane disappeared out of Nowhere so that's more so why it doesn't work.The other good thing about the film is it's effects, they look nice and colourful and give the film a well and grandish look, whilst also being well polished and nice to look at.

,,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8431563/?ref_=tturv_perm_314,"Brings the thunder, but not so much the love.","I liked Taika Waititi's last installment of the Thor series, Ragnarok felt like a fresh and exciting direction for the character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe with a good balance of humor, heart, and presenting the best replication of Jack Kirby's visual style in live action. However, even as I walked out of the theater after seeing that film, I didn't think it should be established as the standard for any and all Thor stories going forward, but it looks like many in Hollywood and its own writer/director Taika Waititi thought very differently, and as a result lightning doesn't strike twice.Firstly, there are many other epic stories from Thor's comic history that would make excellent blockbuster cinema and work fine in the continuity of the established Marvel Cinematic Universe, yet they decided to use more recent runs as the basis for its story - not that that is a bad thing per se, but it's still disappointing.I did like Natalie Portman quite a bit as Jane Foster in the first two Thor films and found her chemistry with Chris Hemsworth to be very good, so I was fine with Portman returning. Gorr the God Butcher being brought in felt like an interesting idea for the screen and Christian Bale playing them raised expectation, and then you have the introduction of other Gods with Russell Crowe as Zeus and that just excited the Marvel Zombie in me, but unfortunately Taika Waititi seems to be in-love too much with his brand of filmmaking and tries to recreate Ragnarok all over again and does anything but succeed in their attempt at doing so. The movie has too much humor to the point where any stakes and drama lack impact, and it will echo memories of the superhero movie duds of the late 1990's and early 00's with its desperation to entertain the viewer.I personally think there is still a lot you can do with Thor and his lore for the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but Taika Waititi should hand the directing duties to someone else - personally, I wish Sir Kenneth Branagh would return and reclaim this franchise. Branagh's 2011 introductory film was a solid representation of the Thor character and his cast of characters, it's operatic and Shakespearean drama coupled with genre filmmaking worked fantastically.As it stands, I would rate this as the worst Thor entry to date, even worse than The Dark World - because even that had more going for it and didn't treat nearly everything as a joke.",Helpful,•,2,8,Darwinskid,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur12357883/?ref_=tturv_usr_314_t,11-Aug-22,

4,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8311008/?ref_=tturv_perm_320,Drama ruined for the sake of comedy,"Love and Thunder, in my opinion, was very underwhelming. Ragnarok was a great movie, one of the best MCU movies, it balanced comedy and drama very well, this movie, does not. It's all over the place.The editing is choppy and scenes feel very rushed. The story is bland and uninteresting. It isn't bad, there are some good moments here and there, like some of the Jane stuff is pretty good and the flashbacks with her and Thor add much needed layers to their relationship. But that is all this movie has going for it. There was potential for an emotional movie here, with scenes that could have been real tear jerkers, but each of these scenes were ruined by some stupid, non funny joke. Taika is a pretty funny writer, but here his jokes fall flat 80% of the time. Chris is good with his line delivery, as always, but everyone else? Nope.Then there is the CGI... What has happened to the MCU movies after endgame? Aside from No way Home, every Marvel movie has had awful CGI, but the effects here are about the same as the recent MS Marvel show. Yes, they look that bad at times.The good thing about this entry in the Thor series, is Christian Bale. He is really good here, and he looks like he is having the time of his life. But his scenes are far few in-between. He doesn't show up much, but when he does his scenes are good. The villain itself is bad, maybe slightly better than that pathetic excuse for a villain in Dark World, but Gorr, is a disappointing villain.Overall, I think this movie is boring, it tries to hard to be funny, and in the process, ruins scenes that could have been great. It feels rushed, and the editing is choppy, poor visuals and an underwhelming villain. It's the weakest entry in the Thor movies, even worse than Dark World - don't hate me for that lol.",Helpful,•,7,6,Dannyboi94,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur65076361/?ref_=tturv_usr_320_t,7-Jul-22,

In market mechanism if you have an abundand supply of something while the demand remains similar, the price of said item goes down. That model works very well here because the more jokes you have, the cheaper they seem and hence the laughs are not there.The plot? Basically nonconsequential filler with just a few events that have any kind of meaning. I am bothered a bit that there is a deus ex son of Heimdall out of nowhere with no previous mention whatsoever. I mean, the kid was fine and likeble in the movie but he comes out of nowhere, like pretty much any other plotpoint.There were a couple of things I did like in the movie but that would be getting into spoilers. The main characters work well with each other (except of Corg, get rid of that guy ASAP please) and the Villain was good. Overall I wanted to give 3/10 but bumped it up because of Christian Bale.

8,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8316199/?ref_=tturv_perm_334,Love and Thunder Makes a Loud Noise In the Theater,"We've been waiting for this, Streamers. Thor: Love and Thunder has finally been released in theaters. The MCU is back before us with more content that we've been clamoring for. This movie follows Thor as he enlists the help of King Valkyrie, Bestie Korg and ex-girlfriend, Jane Foster, to fight Gorr the God Butcher, who intends to make all of the gods extinct.You know with these MCU movies we have to talk about the storyline and the bigger picture. First, a newbie could definitely just watch this movie and not be completely lost about what's going on. As Korg narrates at key points in the movie, he's able to bring us all up to speed. Secondly, I'm no comic book expert but to me this movie doesn't move the universe along that much if at all, which is good. I feel everyone is too wrapped up in how it plays into the phases and multiverse and blah blah blah, which just causes people to not be immersed in and entertained by the product in front of them (*cough cough* alluding to what people did to the Dr. Strange movie but no one asked me, so I'll move on). Lastly, this movie is full of heart. Thor, Jane, and Gorr will pull on your heartstrings throughout in unexpected ways. While some of their plot points weren't fully fleshed out, I recognize that it's hard to make these movies feel important after the emotional depth in Endgame. Nevertheless, Taika's direction and the writing definitely tried their best to fill the movie with heart and humor. Let's move on to the cast.Christian Bale does his thing as Gorr. He's so creepy in this. Bale has a way of slithering across the screen and being menacing even though he's not necessarily physically imposing. Marvel could've taken this to the next level in dastardliness, but it seems like the MCU is building to an overarching Big Bad and don't yet want to give us that Thanos-like figure. Who knows? We may have seen that Big Bad already, but the MCU hasn't truly featured them yet. Anyway! Thor, on the other hand, while goofy and fun, campy, and still beastly, he does come off a bit too corny. And, it's hard to say because some of the exact same moments are definitely going to be moments that people enjoy. The same goes for Korg as well. Taika does a great job voicing Korg, but at times it's a bit much or unnecessary. The fact that he narrates a lot of the movie could be a turn off to viewers. Korg is great in small pebbles but the whole rock mound gets a bit annoying. Our friend, Jane Foster can be annoying too but her bash head Thor-ness is definitely fun to watch. Marvel definitely found a way to make Jane come into her own and not just as a Thor carbon copy, which I enjoyed. I wish I could say the same for Valkyrie. They didn't really let my girl Tessa really shine in this movie. After Ragnarok, I think we wanted that boss chick featured again. Unfortunately, she was more of a bell and whistle than a co-star. Those are the people you come to see but there are a bunch of small characters that either melt your heart, annoy you a bit, make you laugh, or want to see more of. Srangely that mixture, actually gives a movie life. It's just Marvel doing Marvel things making you want more.Long story short, Thor: Love and Thunder while maybe not Ragnarok doesn't fall too far from the tree. Marvel, Taika and Kevin Feige just continue a strong MCU/Thor Franchise. This movie will make you laugh, hold on to your seat, awe at the action, suck back thug tears and more. Thor gets a bit corny but not enough to make me say don't see Bale's creepy Gorr the God Butcher.

I love Christian Bale but I hate the terrible Directing & writing, plus the main character arcs make no sense & devalue them all.Disney for some reason give people with really ""no proof of the talent required"" the power to write & direct a Marvel movie, in this case the power was given to Taika Waititi who ultimately does a dreadful job writing & also directing this film. With the big budget & a great cast of actors this film had real Marvel potential to be a great film but Taika Waititi was a poor choice.If Taika Waititi had wrote for a proper Marvel comic & came up with this exact story Stan Lee would have told him this was simply not good enough for Marvel, as the script does not make sense & in parts becomes too ""silly"".Now I'm all for a little bit of surprising ""humour"" in Marvel films as you would get in comics, but at it's core this is still supposed to be a serious universe that has serious consequences if the heroes fail & you have to feel that.By the end of the film the script & directing by Taika Waititi feels more like a parody of real quality Marvel films ( & comics ) which I find disrespectful.Now the film still gets 5 stars from me because parts of the film are really good & this is because of the acting ability of many of the excellent cast, for example Christian Bale is a truly magnificent actor whose overall performance in this film really is top notch ( I really feel sorry for him as a lot of the film script by Taika Waititi really ruined the film ) as Gorr is a great character.Chris Hemsworth as Thor is very good though the script seems to try to make him look more & more of an idiot ( as his character arc is declining here ).Some of the scenes Chris Hemsworth has to do are so poorly conceived & become so ridiculous I really feel sorry for him as we know he is a great Thor.Natalie Portman & Tessa Thompson both do OK however I feel the script they had to work with really did not help them to really show off their acting talent.Russell Crowe was not very good ( seems he does not understand that Super Hero films are meant to be taken serious ) as he acted in it like it was some kind of parody ( like he was supposed to be a parody or in a bad ""panto"" ).This was a very bad casting choice & when he arrives in the film it really does start to go more & more downhill from there ( Taika Waititi to blame mostly ).By the end of the film it starts to insult everyone's intelligence & becomes unbelievably farcical, as I certainly won't be adding this film to my Marvel collection as the appearance of the guardians of the galaxy at the start of the film actually gave the film a decent start but the script of Taika Waititi killed it.Disney have killed the Marvel movie franchise from being the juggernaut it was as simply they don't respect the Marvel universe enough to ensure it's image is protected instead they give directors with no previous big action super hero movie total control & just sit back as they destroy years of hard work that previous actors & quality writers & directors put in to build the Marvel Universe ( films such as Iron Man, Captain America & yes Thor ).The original film Thor (2011) with Director Kenneth Branagh & Writers
Ashley Miller(screenplay), Zack Stentz(screenplay), Don Payne(screenplay) must all watch this film & say to themselves what has Taika Waititi done & you have to ask what has co-script writer Jennifer Kaytin Robinson done?Jennifer Kaytin Robinson must take at least 30% of the blame though again if you look at her resume clearly she like Taika Waititi ( 70% to blame ) was no way qualified to write the script for this film, however their only defence is that if so,done offered you a boat load of money to do something such as write a film script why would you turn that down as the really idiots here are Disney.The Marvel films could have made billions for many many years but with these dreadful films killing off fans of the Marvel film series how much has Disney cost them themselves long term. Most likely they have lost Billions.So ultimately I can't really blame Taika Waititi & Jennifer Kaytin Robinson for taking Disney's money but if I see either of those 2 names attached to any future film or TV series I most likely will choose to give that film/show a miss.",Helpful,•,2,3,Web_Of_Doom,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur119169565/?ref_=tturv_usr_338_t,28-Sep-22,
6,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8379195/?ref_=tturv_perm_339,Another Entry on the List of Mediocre Phase 4 Movies,"Thor Love and Thunder is the latest Thor movie, as well as the latest Phase 4 MCU film. As far as the Thor movies are concerned there hasn't been one I flat out dislike. I enjoy the first movie. Dark World is okay. Everyone hates that one, but it had some hype moments for me, and I was never truly bored in it. Ragnarök is one of my favorite MCU movies. So, I was somewhat excited for this as it has the same director attached. Although, my excitement dwindled after seeing Dr. Strange 2 and seeing the reviews for this film. I personally have found Phase 4 quite disappointing. The only entries I think have actually been good are Spiderman No Way Home and Falcon and the Winter Soldier. Everything else has ranged from okay to incredibly subpar. Dr. Strange 2 especially has been one of the most disappointing MCU films for me. This movie, unfortunately kind of follows suit on that trend.I will say that I was never bored in this film. Other films like Dr. Strange 2, Black Widow, and Shang-Chi gat pretty boring in places. This film is fun on a dumb action movie level, so it has that over other Phase 4 entries even though it probably is on par with them on a quality standpoint. There first twenty minutes of this movie in particular were really strong. I was always entertained, though that's more to do with the actors than the writing. Chris Hemsworth is such a charismatic actor that you love to watch even when he's given garbage scripts. I really like the villain here. I love his design, and Christian Bale, as always gives a good performance. I found myself sympathizing with him a bit, which is more than I can say for most MCU villains. The film, like Ragnarök, is beautiful to look at.Many people hate Jane as a new Thor, but I didn't mind too much. Jane as a female Thor did not surprise me, as I know of her from the comics. This is actually the most I've ever like Jane in these movies. In the first two she was just the token love interest character, especially in Dark World. Here she's given much more to do and is given a sympathetic arc of her own. She also didn't outright steal the show away from Thor, which is what I was afraid of happening. I will also say, the film's ending surprised me. I did not think it would end that way, especially since the MCU has been becoming more woke these days.On to the negatives now. The other gods featured here are terrible. Zeus and the Greek gods are a complete joke. I'm a Russel Crowe fan, but he's awful here. This is his worst performance that I've seen from him. You know you screwed up when the Percy Jackson movies did the Greek gods more justice.Also, just like in Dark World, the humor is very hit or miss. Ragnarök had this problem to an extent, but the jokes in that were more hit than miss for me. Plus, you had Loki or the Hulk for Thor to work off of. You don't have that here. You have the Guardians of the Galaxy, but they're not in the movie nearly as much as the trailers led you to believe. Much of the humor fell flat for me here.Overall, Love and Thunder is harmless fun. It will entertain you while you're watching it, but it certainly is not one of the more memorable MCU movies. I'd say it's on par with Dark World. Sadly, much like a lot of Phase 4, this film feels very much like a throwaway entry.

Tessa Thompson drinking herself off an entrance? Gold. Thor hijacking Gamesmaster's ship (Don't touch anything"")? Another gem. Love and Thunder certainly began with hope when Thor throws his cloak at the beginning of the movie, but by the third song recycled from the Appetite for Destruction album alone (there was no other hard rock band they could use in a hard rock themed movie?), the film was showing its wear and tear. That's not to say Love and Thunder is a bad film, since the cast is all staying true to character, the pace of the movie is on point, the colour, the design, the shade... Love and Thunder is in fact a sharp movie, but the film itself is handcuffed to way too much continuity that has to be answered to.A god worshipping soul loses all faith when unanswered drought claims his daughter. Answering to a cursed sword's call to seek revenge, all gods are put on notice as they are starting to be exterminated. Thor, who returns to shape and spirit after his latest trials, has a target on his back as he holds something of value to this God Butcher.What I do like about Waititi's approach in Love and Thunder is the use of the children. Say what you will about the climax (it's a superhero film, people), Waititi's movies have usually featured kids as the protagonist and Love and Thunder could have used more of their screen time, particularly with Gorr, or have them enjoying New Asgard. What we get instead are some very tiring cliches bogging down an already heavy film. In the face of cancer and abducted children, we didn't need to know Korg's mating rituals. Thor's romance over a former flame (not Jane) was also adding to unnecessary screen time. The key that made Ragnarok feels effortless was the successful banter between characters and parties that made the plot hold. Love and Thunder, though flashy and full of heart, misses that same effortlessness, making for a sometimes tiring watch.",Helpful,•,0,1,Rex_Stephens,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur3379318/?ref_=tturv_usr_343_t,23-Mar-23,

So did it live up to Ragnarok let's see.The cast is all around great and the chemistry between Chris Hemsworth and Natalie Portman is on full display. They really brought their relationship to life in this one and I feel they handled it much better then the first two Thor films. But I do feel that certain plot points involving their characters were rushed and didn't deliver the emotional punch the writers were looking for. Christian Bale is the standout for me (which is exactly what I expected), his performance as the gritty intimidating Gorr is amazing and why I wish we got more of it. The vast majority of Marvel films have the issue of not focusing on the villain enough and this film is no exception. Every scene involving Gorr is incredibly well done and if they were to have given me more of that it may have been the best MCU film but the constant shift in tone taints the overall quality.Every scene that didn't involve Gorr was very comedic and I felt that the comedy was not handled well for a number of reasons. First when you set up a movie with a villain as dark as Gorr, you need to keep the tone consistent and this film did no such thing. There were a lot of well written jokes but they didn't at all mix with the overall story. Gorr has one goal and that is to kill all the gods and he does some pretty messed up stuff to achieve this goal so to take that premise and intertwine it with a romantic comedy you get what is a very weird feeling movie.The visuals are across the board great and one fight sequence in particular may be one of my favourite from the MCU. The music is very on point throughout the entire film as they pair the awesome action sequences with amazing classic rock hits.Overall Thor: Love and Thunder is a good film. Thor and Jane finally receive their deserved development and Christian Bales Gorr is nothing short of menacing. But the lack of a consistent tone makes for a weird and at times frustrating watch that taints the overall quality of the film.7/10

They would double down on the jokes, never giving the plot or character moments time to breathe and turn it into a tiktok video style clipshow for the ADS generation.What I didn't expect was for them to mess up the plot this badly.The setup of this was actually interesting. This could have been good, if not excellent.Take the opening scene (not a spoiler): Christian Bale's people are left to die by an uncaring god. He watches his daughter waste away and die. When he meets his god, the god is a fat jolly guy laughing and pointing at a fallen guy with the ""godkiller"" sword. How convenient. He then mocks Christian Bale who promptly kills him. It starts serious, but ends up as a joke.There are several issues with this. One, it is said gods derive their power from people worshipping them. Why then is this god strong and jolly? It would have been far more efficient for him to be a decrepit loser without any power, and Bale to renounce him then as worthless.Similarly, (again not a spoiler, because it's revealed in promotional material and in the comics) Jane Foster is dying of cancer. Expositionary dialogue reveals Mjolnir chose her to protect her. But it's also draining her life when she transforms and kills her faster. Umm, what? Is anyone proofreading this garbage before they film it? This fully contradicts itself.Not only is Mjolnir functioning again after being destroyed before, rendering that entire scene moot, but it's now better because its shards work like a projectile weapon. Nothing in this has consequences.A better setup: Have Thor bring the ruined hammer to Jane so she can study it. Maybe the hammer actually gives her cancer. And then the appearance of the villain sets in motion that she must sacrifice her own life expectancy to save the day and her love. Now suddenly it has gravitas. Self-preservation vs being a hero. Characters that make hard choices are interesting. Characters who just goof around are not.The entire movie is played for laughs. Every potentially serious moment is turned into a joke (except cancer, they don't joke about that). Worse, the jokes are terrible attempts at noisy slapstick. Screaming goats, remember that internet meme from 2005? It's back. Several times.Most newer Marvel movies since GotG tend to be tonally messy, but this is Ghostbusters 2016 level. Constant talking and bickering about nonsense, endless wink wink humor, references to pop culture, and again with an annoying Melissa McCarthy.As usual, the movie suffers from Marvel bloat as well. Too many characters with too little to do. This could have worked nicely as a small, somewhat thoughtful little character drama with Thor and Jane mending their relationship as she makes the ultimate sacrifice and learns to appreciate what it means to be a hero, and why Thor wasn't there for her because he was... saving the universe. But no, we get the Guardians, Valkyrie who does nothing except the director and Lady Sif, who is treated as a joke as well (the one joke that actually made me chuckle).For once, the critics got it right. This movie is a tonal mess, the acting talent is wasted on a subpar slapstick comedy, and the Marvel downtrend continues.Side note: The CGI looks atrocious. Every scene looks like a bad LSD trip with mismatching colors all over the place. My eyes were thankful for a particularly desaturated scene later in the movie during which I found myself rooting for the villain. Christian Bale wastes a good performance and seems to be the only one not in on the joke, that this movie is essentially a Naked Gun style farce. They did him dirty.Now in fairness, it's been said the original cut was 4 hours. Maybe it was more coherent. Maybe they excised some interesting character moments and ruined the pacing. Justice League showed what studio interference can do to a film, and Taika Waiti has proven that he can balance comedy and serious with his fantastic Jojo Rabbit.

I mean he is a fine character I guess. I don't even remember if I liked the previous movie. I think I did. It was the one with Hulk and Jeff Goldblum, or no wasn't there something in between? Did I ever see the Dark World, or was it called the Dark Elf, I won't look it up, that is how much I care. It's possible I saw that movie. Anyway that is all a blurr. Thor is fine, Chris Hemsworth is ok. Don't love him, don't hate him. Again, can't remember if I've seen him in something else? I do remember the all-female Ghostbusters remake but not much else. He is kinda been only Thor. So yeah, I don't know why I'm watching this film.Does anyone care about the MCU anymore? I mean seriously, is it still sold as the mix of multiple different genres and storyline into one big showdown? That sound awfully like a 2010s thing.

This movie is on the shorter side when you compare it to the other Marvel movies and in my opinion, it works to a certain extent. The pacing goes at just the right speed throughout the entire movie, except at a few spots where the movie does come to a halt, and makes sure to keep the audience entertained from start to finish.Even if the pacing for this movie wasn't the greatest, the story for this movie is still interesting enough to hook you along for this wild ride. From the very opening scene to the last I was hooked wanting to know more and see what happens next. I will say though the story for this movie does feel like it tried to take on too much for this story. Like I said the pacing works to a certain extent and I feel like if this movie was just a tad bit longer some things could've been explored more. With that being said, with the two main story points in this movie, the movie does a good enough job of exploring those points and keeping the audience invested.This can also be attested to the actor's work in this movie which was marvellous. Whether an actor in this movie had five minutes of screen time to being a main character everybody was bringing their everything to this movie. Due to this, the audience grows to care for these characters and wants to see them succeed. The standout performances in this movie for me were Christian Bale and Natalie Portman, who plays Dr. Jane Foster/The Mighty Thor. Christian Bale originally didn't want to play Gorr and I'm so thankful his kids talked him into it because I can't imagine anybody else playing this role. He was able to switch between so many different emotions that made the audience both scared and sympathetic towards this character. The same can be said for Natalie Portman's performance in this movie where she shows how much of a badass Jane Foster is as both a regular human and as the mighty Thor. I do wish though that some characters got some more screen time such as King Valkyrie, played by Tessa Thompson.One thing that Marvel movies are really known for is their hit-or-miss special effects, especially their CGI, and the special effects in this movie definitely were a hit. Sometimes the special effects can start out either way and then slowly get worse or better but here they remain the same throughout the movie. I especially loved the CGI on the screaming goats who stole the movie.The special effects in this movie really do help out with the cinematography which also was great. The cinematography for this movie was gorgeous and helped the audience visually understand where exactly they are by helping create these grand worlds.Now, I know it's become a common thing to hate on the comedy in Marvel movies and I will admit that the comedy in this movie might not work for most, especially this one recurring joke, but for me, it worked. I really enjoyed the comedy in this movie as it still didn't overpower some of the more serious moments and would come at the right time. It also helps that this movie wasn't afraid to actually have serious moments in this movie and let them be just that serious moments.The final thing I want to mention is the soundtrack for this movie and how much of a banger it is. From the musical score, composed by Michael Giacchino and Nami Melumad, to the songs they added into the background everything worked for this movie. Please Marvel do more soundtracks with retro music.In the end, Thor: Love and Thunder isn't going to work for some but if you enjoyed Ragnarok you'll probably enjoy this one as well.",Helpful,•,4,11,Benslie,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur69664646/?ref_=tturv_usr_355_t,10-Jul-22,

Let me start the review with saying Thor: Love and Thunder's first act (or first half,) is indeed not great. The humor falls flat a lot, the CGI is questionable at times( this is actually a problem throughout the movie ) and I just couldn't shrug off the corporate-lifeless feel during those parts. I was patiently waiting for the movie to move onto the more interesting scenes. And luckily, the movie did! (Sort of)When the movie entered the 2nd act and started to focus less on comedy and more on action and emotions, my investment improved quite a bit. (Even though jokes were still there and they were still kinda cringe, but they were better than before) The battle of the Shadow Realm has one of MCU's most visually interesting choices, and I actually had to hold back my tears during the final moments, did not expect the villain to be the heart of a MCU movie. But Gorr definitely would have benefited from more screen time tho. Since he was basically absent during the second act. Even though the movie does have some emotional moments during the final act, I'd say one of the biggest problems of the movie is the lack of tension / urgency. A character supposedly dies or gets injured badly, but turns out it is not a big deal later on. Also, The movie sort of feels like a 'Stepping Stone' type movie. While the movie overall was fun, I don't think there were any meaning ful arc for Thor. After watching the movie I am more interested in directions the Thor character can go after this one.Overall the movie definitely could have been better, and lowering my expectations did help my experience I think.

Gosh. Latest SM movie was also disgusting. New DS just average. What was the last the can be even called not bad? Black Widow? Eternals? Well, MAY BE! The last good were i'd say Avengers? MCU never had lots of good movies. I'd say Iron Man and Homecoming are the best, solid, last 2 Avengers movies are good(well, i suppose Age of Ultron and Civil War are not that far, but the first Avengers if you look and them now(personally i was in cinema on premiere in 2012, being 13y.o, Avengers entered theatres 1 day before my birthday) have bad dialogues, like they were written by some young schooler and spoils it all) and probably i'd say that i like most of all other Thor 3, though it failed in the end, and couldn't decide either it wants to be an epic action or entertainment.

Lately, Marvel movies haven't been reaching the quality they once did, so I wasn't expecting anything special, and that's probably why I'm not disappointed in the finale. It went by pleasantly quickly because there was a lot of action, which I thought was pretty epic in places, but there's just one catch. Story-wise, it's not such a joy anymore. There is a lot of humour. A lot. That's a classic with Marvel movies, but here there's perhaps I would say a little more of it. I generally don't like a lot of jokes in superhero movies. I prefer more serious superhero ventures, like Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy, but that's beside the point. There were several times in the story where one character was speaking to tell the story and that bothered me. I don't like it much and rarely like it, but sometimes it's cool, but here I didn't like it. Then as I mentioned the humor is really over the top here, which wasn't my cup of tea either. I don't want to spoil, but story-wise it wasn't a total win either. Well it was saved for me by the aforementioned action, which I enjoyed and which Marvel can and probably always will, except for Eternals.

After the highs of Ragnarok, this movie is really a letdown. Only Dark World saves it from being the worst Thor movie.Chris Hemsworth is back as in-shape Thor. There is a silly montage showing him getting back in shape. He is bouncing around with the Guardians of the Galaxy before returning to New Asgard when it is in trouble. Tessa Thompson returns as King Valkyrie and quizzically seems incredibly disinterested in the role. Natalie Portman is back after missing the last couple of movies and she is supposed to be taking over the mantel of Thor. Even Jaimie Alexander is back as Sif, but her role is so small and inconsequential, I'm not really sure why she bothered. The new villain is Christian Bale as Gorr, the God Butcher. He is okay in the role, but the character doesn't really elevate the movie the way Kate Blanchet did in Ragnarock. Even Russell Crowe gets dusted off to play Zeus...yea, the Greek god. And its cringe inducing.Oddly, there is almost no chemistry between Hemsworth and Portman in this sequel. Their romantic scenes have no spark and Portman seems so detached. I got no sense that they were in love. The events in the move have almost as little spark as well. There is nothing that hasn't been done in prior movies and it felt so blah. If this was not an established part of the MCU, this movie would have bombed...hard.One highlight is Matt Damon, Liam Hemsworth, Sam Neill and, even Melissa McCarthy, as the Asgard actors doing plays about the events of the previous movie.

To get on that road, though, takes a lot of patience.As fun as LOVE AND THUNDER is, the movie is also childish, idiotic, superficial, and features way too many Guns-n-Roses anthems. The first twenty or so minutes, where Thor goofs off with the equally-juvenile Guardians of the Galaxy, would tax even the strongest of Asgardian gods. Once the threat of Gorr, the god butcher, arrives on New Asgard's steps, the heroes' quest begins - and that is a most satisfactory story.Taika Waititi makes use of Chris Hemsworth's generous smile and biceps in a familiar and comfortable manner. Thor takes on the mantle of leader and proves he is quite sufficient in the role. Smashing and thrashing and joking (maybe a touch too much of the levity this time around, though) leads to a successful, and actually unsuspecting, ending where you are craving more.First and foremost, Thor is a hero.

Natalie Portman is fed an awful script, genuinely appearing uninterested in her role, and looks ridiculous as a female Thor - I literally pity her for having to appear in this filth, along with poor Christian Bale. If these producers had any actual brains, which clearly almost nobody working for streaming companies that make feature films does these days (Netflix is equally guilty of producing tripe features), when they read the proposed script and saw the name ""Zeus"" it would have been very clever for them to think to engage Liam Neeson in reprising his unforgettable performance as Zeus from Clash of the Titans, to the point that I might have given them one more crucial star towards a barely passing grade. Don't tell me Disney doesn't have the cash that this couldn't have been arranged, since Liam Neeson will seemingly work for loose change these days (not to detract from his work, he's excellent, but he appears quite easy to engage, similar to Nick Cage, who I also enjoy). Russell Crowe is utterly miscast as Zeus - his worn-leather face, stringy hair and obesity simply DO NOT CONJURE VISUALS WORTHY OF A GOD OF ZEUS' STATURE, PERIOD, to the GREAT detriment of that entire sequence. I'm surprised to see Christian Bale in such garbage, but none of the fault lies with him. The film has typically strong visuals (LITERALLY THE ONLY THING GOING FOR EITHER NETFLIX OR DISNEY THESE DAYS) but even the visuals are squandered, as mid-way through the film converts to black and white as they enter some sort of ""shadow realm"" thingy, and honestly, I feel they could have been more inventive making the visuals look good without using color. More routine, boring action sequences and bland storytelling ensue. Whatever, it's garbage, why am I making any effort going any further about it since Disney/Marvel didn't?

Most of the original MCU Avengers have retired, yet the sparkles, the Lord of Thunder, is still putting in the work to change odd bod into god bod. Following all he has lost - parents, brother, friends, planet - he has a lot of issues that he needs to work out. And into this mix comes Gorr, played by an amazing Christian Bale, who challenges Thors strength and other emotions, with his own quest.

Her transformation is straight out the comics, and not to be questioned, though given all the space magic we've seen in previous films, it's good to see Kat Dennings asking some good questions.But the main conflict comes from the Asgardian weapons; despite throwing Mjolnir to Captain America in End Game, it's obvious he still pines for the only object that properly pull him off and there is a lot made of that, to the point it does get juvenile. In fact, quite a lot of the script reduces the thunder god to a doey eyed hippy, which placed against the sinister Gorr - channelling a combination of Voldermort, Marilyn Manson, Joker and other creepy bad guys - makes the story leap from yelling goats and All Spice adverts, to shadow monsters and dead gods. Russel Crowes Zeus sounds like Borat, and while his scene is one of the better set pieces in the film, it does feel like it could have gone bigger.Marvel have access to a vast array of computer generated content, and there are some amazing set pieces, space ships and battle scenes, though I was left wondering if they'd tried deaging Hemsworth and Portman, that left neither actor looking that great.It was a fun pop corn film, with plenty of comedy and action, though tinged with sadness that Bale didn't get more screen time,.",Helpful,•,0,0,feyipuk,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur50483691/?ref_=tturv_usr_383_t,13-Jul-22,

You know a movie isn't great when even Christian Bale's acting isn't very good in particular.Overall this movie is a perfect example of how Marvel have fallen in terms of movie quality over the past few years. The one and only reason i am not giving it a 1/10 is because the CGI was good and the design of certain characters was fine.Before i end this i must stress how poor the characters are developed in this movie. The Butcher character in his first scene seems slightly interesting but quickly becomes boring. Zeus (a character that should be awesome to see in Marvel) is utterly abysmal. His character is boring and not serious at all. One of the worst (if not the worst) MCU characters to date.I personally believe that Taika Waititi is the most overrated director in all of cinema. None of the movies i have seen from this to Jojo Rabbit have been even average and he gets praised to the high heavens.

The focus has definitely been on the Disney+ content as mentioned by Kevin Feige in majority of the press conferences. Both Spiderman No Way Home and Dr Strange Multiverse of Madness were about exploring the multiverse concept mixed with nostalgia. While the other TV shows are exploring many new characters and storylines, we wonder how much of them will get integrated into the big screen releases. Amidst all this, Thor Love and Thunder somehow comes off as an unexpected breeze in the midst of a multiverse storm.Thor Love and Thunder definitely lives up to its expectation as to what was shown in the trailer and also manages to surprise you beyond that. The plot is about Thor taking on the new nemesis Gorr The Godbutcher while also exploring more on his life and love. The movie is not so heavy on action but it doesn't necessarily need it as well. Although the humour element feels recycled from most of the previous MARVEL movies, there are some really funny moments. The movie kind of carries the vibes of initial Thor movies and isn't as chaotic as Ragnarok. Michael Giacchino's score is impressive as always and the use of rock music to enhance the action sequence works once again.Thor Love and Thunder is all about characters and their arc. Chris Hemsworth continues his charming ways of playing Thor and at this point of time he's just living it. Natalie Portman's comeback as Jane Foster and also Lady Thor (or should I say Mighty Thor ;-)) is backed by a very strong reason. She may have had some issues with MARVEL in the past but I believe the script has been well adjusted to overcome all those things. Tessa Thomson as Valkyrie probably although a bystander is uniquely funny. It is Taika Waititi as Korg who takes all the cherry on cake with the majority of the humour associated with his character. Christian Bale is without a doubt impressive as Gorr The Godbutcher and also has a great character arc to support his performance. Most of us may feel he may lack a bit of screen time but considering the movie runtime it is just about fine. Along with the above there are multiple funny and interesting guest appearances in the movie including that of Russel Crowe which fit well.Thor Love and Thunder may not be an action adventure extravaganza like some of the recent MARVEL movies, but it is a movie with character and love.

Unfortunately, most of the humour falls flat as a pancake.Love and Thunder also manages to waste two of the biggest recent storylines in Thor's comic history and squander one of his best villains in Gorr the God Butcher. Thor himself has been reduced to a bumbling man-child, who spends the entire movie staring at Jane Foster like a lovestruck teenager with a hammer fetish.Talking of fetishes, someone involved in the film also has a serious Guns 'n' Roses obsession. The band are plastered all over this movie to a distracting level for some bizarre reason - tunes, posters. T-shirts all feature prominently, with even one character insisting he be called Axl!

Although not all his films were perfect, the direction that has been decided to take with his character has been an emotional and awesome reinvention of what used to be a character that lacked an interesting personality. This film builds upon the events of the previous films that Thor has appeared in and develops a character study of a man who has lost everything and is now in the midst of an identity crisis. This is brilliantly illustrated through the black comedy approach brought upon by director Taika Waititi who is able to balance the sillier aspects of the story as well as the dramatic undertones that breathes life into this film. The visuals are stunning, injecting the world of the Marvel Universe with color and life that is the equivalent of candy for the eyes. The performances are amazing with Chris Hemsworth owning his role as Thor by injecting an admirable balance of comedy and tragedy. Natalie Portman's return as Jane Foster was perfectly handled with her character arc being an emotional beat and justification for the previous films that she appeared in. However, Christian Bale as the antagonist, Gorr the God Butcher, was undeniably one of the film's greatest strengths. His performance was an artistic approach never fully explored in the MCU, delving into an emotional and sinister angle that makes him easily the best villain Marvel has produced. Although some may argue that the film is too silly for its own good, the comedy is brilliantly balanced with drama that will leave the audience in amazement at what it was able to accomplish throughout.

The movie had a engaging storyline with some great humour and action scenes with some great CGI. I think this Thor had the best character development for everyone and we got introduced to some new characters and saw some old. Thor is still badass as ever.I do have to say that some of the humour was forced.The main villain has a very sad backstory which really makes you connect with him.Chris Hemsworth is still badass as Thor but is also trying to find love now after pushing everyone away. Christian Bale plays the main villain Gorr the god butcher and he is terrifying every scene I saw him in he gave me chills running down my spine. Natalie Portman comes back as Jane Foster and is now Thor and she was surprisingly really likeable in this movie. She also had the best character development as well. Tessa Thompson is still Badass and had some pretty funny scenes but she did not get lot to do and she did not appear a lot in this movie. Taika Waititi is hilarious as Korg.

He doesn't quite manage to capture lightning in a bottle twice but he does deliver a perfectly acceptable blockbuster.In many ways Love and Thunder is one of the Marveliest of Marvel movies, something in bad guys past (admittedly something pretty terrible in this case) makes him go all genocidal and to complete his evilness he must find the magic macguffin while the heroes try to stop him via some snappy banter and middling action sequences. The film stands tall in that it has funnier humour than most of its stablemates and a villain that leaves their mark. You'd need to look far and wide to find an actor put in more work with so little time than Christian Bale as god shanker Gorr, elevating a character that could easily have been another Malekith the Accursed into one of the franchises most memorable villains.While Love and Thunder has no problem balancing its jovial tone with a menacing villain it is less successful at adding a stage four cancer story to the mix. The physical transformation in Natalie Portman's Jane from wasting away patient to shredded Mjolnir wielder is impressive and Portman looks like she is actually enjoying being in one of these for the first time but the story doesn't half bring an Asgardian size elaphant into the room. It's pretty hard to believe that in all his travels through the cosmos Thor hasn't been to one place he thinks might have a shot at curing cancer.A rather subdued film by Taika Waititi standards and there is no doubt the Marvel formula has been worn so thin its transparent but there is still fun to be had and Thor gets a satisfying end to his story.",Helpful,•,2,3,danchilton-71955,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur68828911/?ref_=tturv_usr_427_t,15-Jul-22,

It's true that he has his own aesthetic, but it's an aesthetic that feels calculated rather than one that has naturally manifested itself as his career has progressed. Love and Thunder was overloaded with hit-or-miss jokes, while the dialogue felt obnoxiously simplistic, as though it had been dumbed down to a level appropriate for a children's book. Still, there were certain scenes that worked to perfection, like the cinematically blissful battle in the shadow realm. And although he didn't have as much screen time as I would have liked, Russell Crowe emanated pure likeability as Waititi's rendition of Zues.

I was pleasantly surprised and loved the humor. The movie is indeed irreverent and I agree that it is strange to see the irreverent humor laid across the more serious aspects of it. That said, humor is one of the ways we cope with tragedy. That's kind of its main purpose in our psyche.To me, this film kind of sits in the series like Moonraker does in the James Bond series. It doesn't really have a point and is panned almost universally, but if you switch your brain off and watch it for it just for fun, it's enjoyable (at least if you have an open sense of humor I guess). I can see how most MCU diehards will hate it, because it does not really advance any overall plot or develop the characters in a way that is meaningful to the overall universe.One strength of the film is that it continues the overall trend of Thor being the most tragic yet most developed of the major MCU characters. He has had to deal with the most loss and the biggest psychological challenges of the series as a whole. I think what he does here, given the new challenges he faces in that way, is a very good depiction of how we should try to live our lives. Thor has been through a lot, but he just keeps pushing forward, and I think that is a testament to his character and the portrayal, despite all of the other parts of his story and this film. Natalie Portman and Tessa Thompson's roles fit into this perfectly, and they all look like they are having fun.I think the biggest problem here is not the film itself. It is that the MCU set such a high expectation for an overall storyline with the stones/Thanos, and doesn't really know what to do next. It has become a series of episodes that do not clearly link in the storyline. I think a lot of MCU fans are struggling with that, which makes sense given how tightly most of the series fit together previously. So again, you do have to just switch off a bit to really enjoy this, but for most people I think it will be enjoyable to do so, as long as you don't mind the screaming goats (which I found hilarious).",Helpful,•,3,5,vandykeu,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur40664607/?ref_=tturv_usr_442_t,11-Sep-22,

6,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8327419/?ref_=tturv_perm_445,Botched first act and underdeveloped villain,"Marvel Studios' Thor: Love and Thunder finds the God of Thunder (Chris Hemsworth) on a journey unlike anything he's ever faced - a search for self-discovery. But Thor's retirement is interrupted by a galactic killer known as Gorr the God Butcher (Christian Bale), who seeks the extinction of the gods. To combat the threat, Thor enlists the help of King Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson), Korg (Taika Waititi) and ex-girlfriend Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), who - to Thor's surprise - inexplicably wields his magical hammer, Mjolnir, as the Mighty Thor. Together, they embark upon a harrowing cosmic adventure to uncover the mystery of the God Butcher's vengeance and stop him before it's too late.Returning to the franchise after helming 2017's Thor: Ragnarok, Taika Waititi has once again put his unique stamp on the connected universe, creating a film that only he could. With Ragnarok, Waititi debuted a madcap rock-infused adventure romp with a far less serious Thor, creating a break from the previous two films that while, with moments of brilliance, didn't quite live up to the character's potential. Here in Love and Thunder, Waititi brings the same manic energy but slightly tempered, choosing instead to deepen the relationship between Thor and Jane Foster. The result is a film that is true to its name: love and thunder, bringing plenty of humor, action scenes, and a generous helping of character development.While there's plenty to like in Love and Thunder, the film is not without its problems, namely in its villain and its pacing. The first act is a jumbled mess of scenes, hopping all around the galaxy without giving the audience time to settle and orient themselves. The opening scenes lack the emotional gut punch of the original Guardians of the Galaxy; where James Gunn made us immediately care about young Peter Quill and his relationship with his mother, here in Love and Thunder, Waititi doesn't take the effort to fully develop the relationship between Gorr and his daughter. That, plus the subsequent scene after as Gorr meets his god, make for a rocky start to the film that takes a while to recover from. Speaking of The Guardians of the Galaxy, the team appears more as a reminder that they exist and a nice treat to hold us over for Volume Three than for any real plot specific reason, outside of them receiving the initial distress call. Each member, with the exception of Star Lord, gets one or two lines before they take off, making their inclusion for the most part unnecessary. Once the film settles, which unfortunately isn't well into the second act, the ride becomes smoother and more enjoyable.Thor: Love and Thunder doesn't do much to further the overall development of the Marvel Cinematic Universe; much like Ragnarok only has a scene of two that props up Infinity War, any longstanding ramification of Love and Thunder are either unclear or nonexistent. Not that that's a problem; the main focus should always be on the film at hand and not the tie in possibilities (looking at you, Age of Ultron). Still, while the fourth phase of the MCU continues to remain murky after the events of Love and Thunder, there are hints of future antagonists for the God of Thunder to clash with down the road.Starring Chris Hemsworth in his eighth outing as the Thor Odinson, Love and Thunder brings a return to form for the chiseled Australian actor. Gone is the flabby dad bod of Avengers: Endgame as the character emerges from his slump and continues to find his purpose in the galaxy. With director Taika Waititi choosing to tap into the previously unharnessed comedic abilities of Hemsworth, Thor as a character has become immensely more charming, if not a bit dumber for the sake of the jokes. This dumbing down of a person who was initially presented with the Shakespearean gravitas of a demigod wrestling with becoming king has ultimately suffered for the drastic change of tone. While Hemsworth seems to enjoy this lighter, campier version, the silliness of his nature juxtaposed against the seriousness of events can at times create a tonal imbalance that was present in Ragnarok and is again present here in Love and Thunder. Still, Hemsworth is never more loveable or dashing then when he's playing Thor and if it's a role he wants to continue to revisit, then it's a role that's guaranteed to keep the audience returning.As for returning, Natalie Portman makes her way back into the MCU as astrophysicist Jane Foster, the first character Thor meets while banished on Earth back in the franchise's first film. Initially unsatisfied with the direction of Thor: The Dark World, Portman departed and has only reappeared through cut footage in Avengers: Endgame during the time heist. Fortunately, lured back by the promise of becoming The Mighty Thor, Portman's grand reentry into the franchise is a bittersweet one: years have passed and when we pick up with Jane Foster, time has not been kind to her. As Jane suffers her battles, Portman once again proves that she's a top-notch actress, delivering the gravity, the humor, and holds her own in action scenes with Hemsworth. The chemistry between the pair is better here in Love and Thunder than it ever was in the first two Thor films; whether that's due in part to having new writers and directors that understand the source material or due to the time the characters have spent apart is inconsequential, it's great to see Thor and Jane mix it up again in both action scenes and in the classic will-they-won't-they trope that only works as good as the actors' commitment to it. Thankfully, in this film, both Portman and Hemsworth commit fully and almost all of their best scenes together over three films are collected in this one outing.Unfortunately, the restoration of Jane Foster's character comes with certain sacrifices, namely by way of Valkyrie, our favorite scrapper from Sakar. King of Asgard, thanks to the denouement of Avengers: Endgame, Tessa Thompson's presence is almost completely overshadowed by the return of Jane Foster. Thompson, equally as charming and charismatic as Hemsworth, doesn't have much to do in the film; a good bit of her time is spent observing Thor and Jane from the sidelines as the pair attempt to figure their relationship out. What little screentime she gets is mostly as a background character with a handful of lines. There's no development to her whatsoever beyond being a beleaguered ruler of her tiny fiefdom who longs to still mix it up in a good fight. Thompson's talents are mostly wasted in this film, which is a shame since she's featured so prominently in Ragnarok.Possibly the most underserved character in the film is its villain, Gorr the God Butcher. Played by Christian Bale of Batman fame, the actor jumped universes to embody one of the most menacing and problematic villains of recent Thor history. With a moniker like 'the God Butcher' and the means to do so, Gorr could easily have joined the ranks of Thanos or Killmonger in terms of threat level and sympathy, but the end result is instead a weak performance backed by weak writing. Far from Bale's best work, Gorr the God Butcher goes missing from the film for entire swaths of time as the heroes traverse the galaxy looking for help in defeating him. He comes alive far too late in the film's third act in a brilliant black and white set piece but by then the damage is done. Instead of a fascinating and complex antagonist, we get something akin to a Phase 1 villain with decent motivation but little development. Bale suffers for it and the film itself suffers for it.Written and directed by Taika Waititi, his second entry into the MCU, Thor: Love and Thunder once again has his fingerprints all over it. Waititi's trademark humor and oddball characters are on full display throughout, delivering a movie unlike any other in the cinematic universe. Where the filmmaker has stepped his game up, however, is in the cinematography department; he, director of photography Barry Idoine, and the visual effects team have managed to create some of the most visually stunning interstellar scenes the audience has been privy to within the MCU so far. While the Phase Four films continue to suffer from some spotty CGI, and Love and Thunder is no exception to this, it's clear that Waititi has thoughtfully crafted a movie that, while less colorful than Ragnarok, is still full of Walt Simonson-inspired treats.Overall, Thor: Love and Thunder takes the zaniness and camp of Thor: Ragnarok and doubles down. Taika Waititi's love of classic rock shines through again as the audience is treated to a number of well placed needle drops and cheer worthy moments. With a visual palette that completely differentiates itself from the rest of the MCU, Waititi has created a film that manages to stand out as one of the more distinct looking films in the oeuvre. Chris Hemsworth and Natalie Portman's chemistry is undeniable, and after almost a decade apart, it's a delight to see the pair together again. Even with its botched first act and underdeveloped villain, the film is still a fun ride in theaters.",Helpful,•,1,3,dmansel,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur123353548/?ref_=tturv_usr_445_t,12-Jul-22,

Thor: Love and Thunder was everything but boring. The jokes are shot off at every chance given, and the majority land well. In my opinion, it did the one thing Marvel fans are scared of: became a comedy. It was a fresh take on superhero movies in the sense that it didn't just have comedy, but can be classified under the comedy genre. Waititi has a brilliant, zany mind, and this movie really showed that. Christian Bale's Gorr the God Butcher was excellent, and truly a scary villain. Every character had good development as the movie progressed, and Chris Hemsworth was clearly putting a lot of effort into Thor's personality, which payed off. Plus, Natalie Portman's Jane Foster made an epic return, something anyone can get excited for. The movie also gave us a lot of new, exciting characters and things to look forward to in the future - something every Marvel fan loves. While the plot itself was a bit fast paced, and it kind of felt hard to keep up with the different scenes and settings at times, it still carried itself well.

However it misses on 90 percent of the comedy, and while that sounds like an extreme, this film is basically a joke after a joke from the first time we see Thor to the end. It never stops. While the comedy was horrible though you have to give credit to the action and visuals in this movie. They are tremendous and truly fun to watch. The standout here was Christian Bale, his portrayal of Gorr was incredible and he stood out as an actor in this movie. Jane Foster as the Mighty Thor works really well which I wasn't expecting and the universe it starts to make cannon in the MCU is also a huge plus.Overall Thor Love and Thunder is a bad comedy mixed with a great action film and a standout performance.

I can't think of any reason to give this more than 1 star, I would argue even 1 is generous because at least other low effort marvel offerings provide some degree of escapism with mindless but well done action, this doesn't even do that, it's not a case of style over substance, this movie simply has neither.",Helpful,•,4,0,Nob0dy,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur124292999/?ref_=tturv_usr_467_t,4-Aug-24,

Christian Bale was awesome and interesting to see them weave in Greek mythology too, but I'm guessing if they go very far with that, I'm sure half the Greek gods will end up sassy black people as well.Some people correctly criticise that there's too much humour in this movie, but it calms down after a bit.

This is an unabashed laugh out loud comedy, but with a lot of heart. And it ends on very high notes (including the final post credit scene) unlike Ragnarok does. (Not saying L + T is better than Ragnarok because that film was epic in scope and I possibly prefer it, if only slightly more so).In the previous Thor films, I honestly didn't think Chris Hemsworth and Natalie Portman had good on-screen chemistry, but that changed here. Wonderful chemistry between them. I'm glad they fixed that.The screenwriting is probably this film's strongest aspect for me. Taika Waititi & Jennifer Kaytin Robinson nailed the plot, the structure, the dialogue, and the pacing. Taika Waititi's comedic timing shined in directing. I loved the reoccurring gag with the screaming goats.Finally, that 80's rock n roll theme and the gorgeous end credits. This really dialed up the fun to 11.

Sadly there are lots of things that if changed could have made this the best Thor movie yet.Firstly the jokes; some were on point, like the banter between Thor and Star-lord, but i think we could have all done without Beer being poured over Stormbreaker and those damn Goats. Taiki does realise we're not in 2012 anymore right?Then there's the plot holes and some are pretty big. The biggest; Gorr baiting Thor to a trap by kidnapping kids, when he believes all Gods are selfish. Great logic there Taiki.Lastly and most unforgivably, both the Guardians of the Galaxy and Gorr are both massively underused. The GOTG are widely loved and provide funnier humour than Thor, especially when together and Gorr was played so well by Bale. We really should have seen him butchering Gods, otherwise he just looks menacing but there's no context.If this movie had have been made more darker, like The Batman, and focussed on Gorr, it could have been fantastic and if the GOTG were in more of the film it could have been hilarious.

Thor life history was narrated very comical and anyone who did not watch the previous 3 movies will understand. In fact any audience without knowing any back story can catch the concept. Mighty Thor or Lady Thor character was nicely used and good weightage for her as well. Zeus part was cool and most funniest. Valkyrie was also filling and the stone character also.Pros I felt:
Thor attitude always
Mjolnir & Strombreaker
The love part and core content speaking love
Comedy screenplay
Zeus character
BGM & musicCons would be:
Running time - below 2 hours and I'm frustrated as I wish even a 3 hour movie
Weakly designed Gorr character
Lesser time for Gorr
Villain less powerful
Lot of dark scenes - it is minimally visible in theatres
The shadow army is not worthyWhy I cried a lot on cons is because I expected Gorr like a terrific villain and he was just mummified with less preference. Even Thanos who was killing humans had such a built-up and character width - Gorr who kills Gods have just 5 mins of story.However ending was made emotional as always and good leads on the post credit scenes..",Helpful,•,5,3,Moviebuff_Chennai,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur148997147/?ref_=tturv_usr_514_t,7-Jul-22,
1,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8335349/?ref_=tturv_perm_515,Embarrassingly bad,"Thor Love and Thunder is a massive failure. Like Ragnarok, it doesn't take itself seriously. Unfortunately, in this case, the jokes are just not funny. So while Ragnarok carried its audience along through its humor, Love and Thunder fails to do the same, and the audience is left staring at a not funny film that doesn't believe in itself. Soon enough the characters abandon the screen and the worst risk of all superhero movies materializes: all you see is grown-up people in superhero costumes. It's embarrassing for the actors (aren't you a bit old to be wearing superhero costumes?) and by reflection, for the audience.I find that poor directors can hide their weaknesses for so long, and Takia Waititi is one such director. His most famous films, Jojo Rabbit and Thor Ragnarok were generally weak, but went by, disguised in some humor that worked okay. Without that artifice, the gaps of Waititi as a filmmaker are fully revealed in this new Thor.",Helpful,•,11,7,apereztenessa-1,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur16170123/?ref_=tturv_usr_515_t,15-Jul-22,

The jokes were dry as a potato chip and I wanted to turn the movie off and stop watching because it was just that bad!!!! I never cared for Natalie Portman and her acting anyway therefore to see her playing the role as the new Thor was ridiculously stupid!!! I'm so thankful that I didn't pay any money to see this movie or else I'd really be upset!!! I feel like I've been cheated out of my time for even watching this nonsense!!!!

There's a blatant neo PC ideology (that has nothing to do with the majority of folk) forced onto the canvass & on this occasion, it doesn't sit or stick.Really disappointing effort from Taika Waititi. I'm a fan of his work, but, this film is, by far, the worst thing he's done for a mass market.Bad writing, directing, editing, acting; it's basically a bad film.3 stars is generous. Very!

The kids (to not spoil) were a riot near the end. Great use of GnR tunes. Absolutely mouthwatering pit shot from Tessa Thompson (too bad not the same from Portman....remember Black Swan?).Cons: Plot was so so. Too many jokes for its own good. The goats scream was funny the first couple of times. 500 times later it was just bad. Thor is a male bimbo. Underused Bale. Crowe can't find a gym or sound Greek.I hope the next film is better. It feels like Marvel shot their shot in Phase 1 - 3 and is just floundering now. I hope they can find their footing again soon. Just throwing out content isn't going to cut it in the long run.

I had to watch this in four separate segments because I got bored and had to turn it off a bunch of times. I finally made it through the whole movie and I'm pretty disappointed. I thought the new Dr. Strange movie was bad, but this is worse. The only redeeming part of this movie is that the special effects were still decent. Anyone who paid full price to watch this at the movies theaters must be mighty Thor pissed.

But Taika Waititi change everything for the third installment. Now everybody love Thor. But after watching this one, I think Thor has lost his way.This movie amp the comedy up too much. While it's nice to see funny movie, but if it's too silly then it's no good. The third has better balance between comedic and serious scene. This one feels shallow and meaningless. Honestly without Christian Bale as God Butcher, this movie would be a disaster.But is it that bad? Not really. As usual we see Thor God of Thunder in action. He looks stronger than before. Accompanied by Korg, Valkyrie, and surprise surprise, Jane Foster who now has Thor power and wield Mjolnir. As I said Bale portraying Gorr is the best thing here. He outperform other actors and actresses. The action as good as usual. So is the CGI. Russel Crowe as Zeus is fun. And we also get to see The Guardian of the Galaxy team in action.They say Thor will return again.
