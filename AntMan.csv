The last few MCU films have been lackluster at best. Not counting the sort of stand alone Spider-Man No Way Home. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is supposed to start the Phase 5 of this thing and if it goes on like this it's going to get worse!!! This film is of course competently made, looks good and is not horrible but is completely uninspired and like pretty much everything out of the MCE factory since Endgame it's totally forgettable. The reason that the MCU was so successful is that the films had characters we cared about. Stakes were there, of course they were lightoments but there were heroes to root for and some pretty good villains. We cared about what was on the screen. I didn't care at all about what I saw in Quantumania. Not that every film from Iron Man to Endgame was great but they were mostly at least better than average. The two previous Ant-Man films were among the weakest but were still more memorable than this one. The acting in Quantumania is fine but but again no one to really care about. Even Paul Rudd who is usually very engaging seemed just flat and disinterested here. He seems to be phoning it in. The only notable performance is Jonathan Majors as Kang the Conqueror but he alone can't save the film from being a complete snooze fest. I was actually bored fir much if the film.Just below average in an MCU that is just churning out film after film with diminishing results. I think Kevin Feige and company should go back and see what made these films good when they first started. They are getting so formulaic and forgettable.Below average.....Grade: C-",321,66,flicklover,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0266568/?ref_=tturv_usr_1_t,18-Feb-23,

What a let down; sure, sitting in the nicest seats for the best visual, motion and sensory experience was great, but I felt like I was watching a Looney Tunes story, instead of any type of story that is part, or compliments the MCU timeline. This was literally one of Marvel's dullest and most unnecessary movies to date. The entire story was cliched and predictable, and there was more CGI than there was any type of interesting story, let alone one with any substance. Even the normally awesome and hilarious humor in the previous installments was absent in this one. Almost the entire film is taking place inside a CGI story, so there was no need for any movie sets or locations... this was all green-screen nonsense. It's a very generous 6/10 from me, only because I still enjoyed the fun ride in my upgraded seats, although the money spent would've been more fun at an amusement park.",707,195,Top_Dawg_Critic,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur64798417/?ref_=tturv_usr_3_t,17-Feb-23,

Add that they made Kang, the main villain out to be a chump and it appears Marvel has no plan moving forward. Not Kiang the conqueror but Kang the chump.This movie adds to the malaise of poorly written disappointments that is permeated the MCU since Endgame.

You don't feel that this is his story. He is just there. And the story is not even that good. You can feel the lack of great characters from previous movies. They were setting the tone of story and we don't even know what happened to them after previous movie. It's hard to believe that the director is the same person who made two prior movies.

6,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8875350/?ref_=tturv_perm_7,A bit unfocussed,"I enjoyed watching Quantumania. It's a mostly solid and fairly entertaining movie. But relative to MCU standards, it's a bit underwhelming and feels like more of a throwaway movie than something memorable I will keep coming back to.My biggest issue is that I wasn't fully engaged for at least the first half of the movie. I was enjoying it but I wasn't locked in. The story was unfocussed. When the villain becomes prevalent, the movie jumps a level. But it doesn't completely make up for the much weaker first half.The other thing that surprised me was not being mesmerized by the visuals. It's very creative and I didn't notice poor CGI like some others. But it didn't wow me like it frequently does. Maybe we're just getting spoiled with the visuals in movies like Doctor Strange 2 and more recently Avatar 2.There is still a lot of good here. It's pretty funny but doesn't overdo it. This is the second movie in a row where the MCU seems to have dialed back on the ""insert joke here"" strategy. It's probably a result of the negative reaction from the cartoonish Thor 4. Also, I love the villain. I won't say who in case you're smart (and crazy) like me and don't watch trailers. But he's so damn awesome.As someone who loves almost everything in the MCU, Quantumania is near the bottom of my MCU rankings. And it's making me a little nervous that it comes only two movies after Thor 4 which is below it (5 stars). But I still have faith and am not joining the MCU doom and gloom crowd. Phase 4 has three of my favorite entries in the entire MCU (Shang-Chi, Loki S01, No Way Home) and I only disliked two (Eternals, Thor 4). They just need to be more consistent while also not playing it so safe.(3 viewings, opening Thursday IMAX 2/16/2023, IMAX 2/28/2023, 10/5/2023)",234,93,FeastMode,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur104603847/?ref_=tturv_usr_7_t,17-Feb-23,

Apparently this movie was focused on being acceptable to a broad audience range, including young people, Quantumania loses some of its sharp refreshing focus. The created living entities of the quantum universe are more anthropomorphic (human-based) perhaps to be more relatable to children does not reflect the diversity or original forms of life or new-life that would really make this film stellar. As even as special as the set designs and special effects make for a gorgeous setting, there is still room for more crisp, detailed and immersive design work. Some backgrounds end up being mere basic animation projections that do not come up to the level expected of contemporary Marvel productions. Yes, this movie provides an amazing backdrop or canvas and yet the substance and plot of the movie does not rise to the same level.

Concerned with being picked apart by the internet and Neil deGrasse Tyson. I really enjoyed that Quatumania does more of that old school 70s style weirdness while still having things that hint at the science that inspired it. There are crazy creatures, landscapes and communities all over the place. It put me in the mind of something like 'Flash Gordon'(1980) and that's exactly what I've been hoping for from an Ant-man film.It's not Oscar bait, but it's fun with a cool world that they play in. The cast is entertaining and Johnathan Majors especially, is fantastic as Kang. The film does start to tie all the strings Marvel has been placing together.

Overall the humor was like the rest of the previous movies. The cast was all stellar. Doesn't really dive that deep into Kang's story, but what we did get was sufficient. Johnathan Majors portrayal was excellent, just wish he had more substance to work with. The visual effects were definitely spotty. Blue screen overload, wish they took more time blending in the effects with with actors. This leads into Modok, as a concept. I didn't mind his backstop changing, just wish they went more practical with his design.

Thanos and his Infinity War are now part of the past in a timeline that has been upended by the discovery of the multiverse. The hype surrounding Ant-Man and the Wasp 2(?) seemed impossible to meet. The same weight was put on the Multiverse of Madness which cracked under the pressure of expectation. Unfortunately, QuantumMania suffers the same fate. Kang is intimidating, powerful and compelling but has been muzzled and restrained by a screenplay that lacks courage and risk when it mattered. Majors is fantastic as the character and I can't wait to see him develop this character and other variants further. However, I can't help but see a missed opportunity here to plant Kang like a unavoidable tree in the multiverse saga. It feels like Marvel prefers to put all their eggs in the basket of Loki season 2 rather than a feature film.It's not all bad though. On the contrary. The film is often times charming, engaging and genuinely funny. It has some fantastic set pieces with inconsistent CGI which has become the new norm for Marvel as of late. Our main cast of characters are solid, though I can't help but feel Hope has been left by the wayside here. Quantum Mania is a solid entry in the MCU but lacks any weight to be memorable or revolutionary. It had a great opportunity to shock and surprise but chose to play it safe and missed out on some great potential.",158,108,glennmeerten06,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur54651770/?ref_=tturv_usr_17_t,15-Feb-23,
7,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8888265/?ref_=tturv_perm_18,"It's okay for a standalone movie, but for setting up Phase 5. . .","Let's start out with this, I had no big expectations for this Marvel film like I did with Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, and there was a reason why. I wasn't expecting much from this movie, plus I wasn't a big Ant-Man fan to even begin with . . . The previous Ant-Man movies didn't leave much lasting impressions on me, and I was meh about the whole series and the superhero in genreal. So when I heard that this movie was coming out, well of course I was going to see it opening weekend just so I could be on top of the game of seeing it, and not being ruined by the movie. I wasn't seeing this because I was really interested into it . . . Not really, anyhow. But after watching this movie twice in theaters the same day, I can say this: it falls short of what I was hoping it would be, but it deliver a solid set up for Phase 5!I'm not really into the Multiverse, Time Variants, and the Quantum Realm because they just make not only my heard hurt just thinking too much of them, but it makes the MCU timeline even more confusing (than it should be). So to begin with, I wasn't into the Quantum Realm so I could care less if they explored it or not, or if they got trapped in it or not. It was just another big expansion on the MCU side just to get more revenue in, is how I see it. But after watching this movie, I guess you could say it got me to enjoy the Quantum Realm a tad bit better, and fully appreciate all the bright visuals and colors they did to make the Quantum come alive. I mean, beautiful world an all, but I could still care less.This movie sets up not only Phase 5 very well, but the villain for it quite amazingly! If you're like me, you could agree that Phase 4 was a very weak and if I'm going to be honest, a bit unneeded Phase. The only two movies that carried the whole Phase 4 on its back was Spider-Man: No Way Home and Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. No other mentionable movie that was released during Phase 4 made the best impression (although: Doctor Strange 2 could make it). So after an exhaustable Phase 4, we finally move on to I hope a better Phase, Phase 5. Now look, if Marvel/Disney does this right, Phase 5 could be the most interesting Phase since Phase 3!Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania by itself was a decent, average movie that had its moments while also having their cringy moments also. But for the beginning/start-up of Phase 5, not going to lie: it sets up Phase 5 very well. We get introduced to not exactly the most menacing/mean villain of all time, but it's the powers he has and its the other variants of him that just may make Phase 5 villain(s) the most interesting to watch . . . To see how Marvel and Disney unfolds his intentions, his powers, and the affect he'll have in the MCU timeline (that is, if they do it right of course). Kang was an interesting villian in this movie . . . He was played by a Johnathon Majors who actually did a great job, so I'm excited to see more of him in later Marvel films. Johnathon Majors has potential in the MCU, and if Marvel and Disney does it right, it may just be the biggest role Johnathon has played in his movie career . . . Or it could be the somewhat of a downfall, just depending on how Marvel and Disney plays out Kang.But Ant-Man just being a standalone movie in its series does farily alright. I think the beginning struggled to catch my attention. I think the first time watching it I was just waiting for Kang to appear on the screen, and kind of caring less of what playing at the moment. People/Critics alike raved about Johnathon Majors' performance, so of course I wanted to see if hey did actually a good job . . . And after watching it, I think he did a great job! But this movie has some interesting points that they brought to the table; maybe I could have taken the whole thing serisously if the 3rd act of the movie didn't just go a bit out of hand. I felt like the 3rd act of the movie was the downfall of the movie. It's just got a bit out of hand and that cringy speech in that movie didn't help at the least.The 1st and 2nd act were interesting enough, but my favorite moments were when we were trying to understand the villian Kang a bit more. He was easily the best part about the movie, and outshadowing everyone's elses role in the movie, and not lying here. He's just a villian we have never gotten before, so I'm interested on how they're going to handle Kang, and he might be one of my favorite villians that has been brought to big screen. The other characters in the movie that weren't main characters like Scott and Hope, were more or less so unmemorable and they were in the shawdows in a lot of the movie. So basically, any characters in the movie that didn't have a big role were sidelined people who were underused in the movie.M. O. D. O. K. Was the worst character in the movie and also one of the most unneeded too. I struggled to comprehend/digest him fully, and to be honest I could really care less about him. He wasn't an annoying character, he was just one that made me question why we even have him in the movie to begin with. But besides that character, this movie undergoes a lot of underused characters, and more or less put them in the shadows. Really unfortunate that we didn't get to understand these people in the Quantman Realm more.Besides some questionable choices for the movie, a cringy speech, a 3rd act getting a bit out of hand, characters being underused, and a character not needed, this movie is a bit solid. For being a standalone Ant-Man movie it was okay, but for setting up Phase 5 and its villian, it did a great job! It was a movie that I enjoyed more on my secondtime and understood more. It's not I would want to see over and over, but it's one that I'm glad I saw how they setted up Phase 5!",11,3,chgames-28385,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur135574361/?ref_=tturv_usr_18_t,23-Feb-23,

He is the comic relief. He shouldn't lead the universe. I think that it should be Loki. His TV show is what introduced Kang anyways and he could be the unlikely heroic lead. The MCU is becoming unbalanced as the TV shows are overshadowing its supposed superior theatrical releases.As a movie, this feels trapped in the CGI strange world of superhero green screen. It's too chaotic at times. Most of it is super CGI. Kathryn Newton is the new hottie which is a strange thing to say. I miss the baby-faced cutie of the original Cassie. I don't like Janet in this one. Michelle Pfeiffer is stuck in playing the troublesome character. After some time, I realized that she needs to be separated from Hank. They could be arguing over the experiment when it goes off. She is just set up wrong. At the end of the day, this is a pretty simple story and it's the modern-day standard for the superhero movie.

The Quantum Realm is now perfectly habitable, but there's a universe-conquering villain which links into what Miss Pfeiffer was doing all those years, and....Doesn't really matter. What matters is that this series within the Marvel Cinematic Universe was good because of the sense of humor of the creators, and that's all gone.

This is bad news as far as Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) is concerned. She spent decades inside there and has harboured some secrets about it.Before the latest experiment is shut down, they are transported inside the weird, wonderful psychedelic world of the Quantum Realm. They meet an old friend of Janet, Lord Krylar (Bill Murray.)Now things have changed, everyone is afraid of Kang The Conqueror (Jonathan Majors.) He once saved Janet until she found out what kind of person he really was.Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is light and frothy. It has all the nourishment value of a McDonalds Thick Shake.

Hopefully to give a bit of joy and entertainment, while also having a deeper cut. Not too deep mind you - most of the time. And that is how you should experience this too. On an Imax screen if possible, but with an open mind (even more important).The movie works - not because it without flaws. Not because it makes sense (probably not even all the inner logic is ... tight) ... but because it is fun. And all that without Michael Pena! I won't say who is in this - you either know or you will find out. The movie begins with Ant Man reintroducing himself to us. If you have forgotten who he is - or if you haven't seen any other movie yet. It makes sense to be up to date ... but it is not necessary. And it is what makes this even more fun.The movie also channels a lot of Science Fiction ... well movie history before. It's not that Star Wars did not steal .. sorry, homaged other Science Fiction stuff, so if you see Star Wars here ... if you see Pixars lamp here (I'm quite sure I am not the only one who does), if you think of Lord of the Rings when you hear the tower line ... heck even the ""get to the chopper"" line can be spotted ... well tweaked and all that. But still if you look hard enough ... there is a lot to enjoy.And the movie has quite a few things to entertain the adults too. Not just the hints to the past of Michelle Pfeifers character (she had needs too), but also the use of curse words. Even with a ""holy"" in front of it, it did surprise me to hear the s word twice in the movie. I was not offended and I would hope no one else was.And I have not even gotten into the story - into the plot of the movie. It works as I already wrote without any prior knowledge ... it does link to other things though ... and the post credit scene especially is a foreshadowing of the best kind ... some even call it one of the best post credit scenes Marvel has done yet. You decide ... one thing is for sure, if you suspend your disbelief and just go with the flow ... the cast is fun enough to make you forgive its missteps ... be it almost botched character arcs ... jokes that may or may not work with you ... and the overall tone of the movie.A tone that switches - the same way Jonathan Majors seems to be able to switch. What a great find for the MCU - charismatic, yet able to draw you in. Maybe he is not that bad after all? But isn't the devil the most charming of them all? Or at least that is what they say ... while Christian Bale gathered a lot of praise for his Thor villain ... Kang is here to stay - I had to do at least one more pun and you know it.Ant Mans daughter who is recast for the movie - she seems to have a bright future ahead of her. There is a lot of rumor going around about the MCU and their planning for the future ... and the future is for the young ones ... isn't it? So sit back, relax and enjoy this movie that (re)intoduces us to Kang ... and if you are not Comic Book savvy ... don't worry, you won't be left behind ... no pun intended to close it all up.",6,20,kosmasp,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur5876717/?ref_=tturv_usr_29_t,18-Feb-23,

Jeff Loveness and Jack Kirby, was just rubbish. It was such a far out there storyline that it was near impossible to take serious. Luckily the movie was kept afloat by the over-the-top and impressive CGI special effects.The acting performances in ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" were good, and they definitely had a good and solid cast ensemble for the movie, with the likes of Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly, Michael Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer, Jonathan Majors, Kathryn Newton, Kathryn Newton, Bill Murray and Corey Stoll.The special effects, wardrobe and props are off the charts in ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"", but then again, that is the case with all Marvel movies, now isn't it?

The concept was a scientist (Michael Douglas) had developed a technique to shrink the size between atoms some 25 years earlier but shelved it, and in fact denied it, because his protégé has evil intentions for it, making the world a more dangerous place.Then that was followed up with the 2018 ""Ant-Man and The Wasp"" where together Ant-Man and Wasp must protect the secrets of the shrinking technology.Now we have this one, 2023 ""Quantumania"" and, as the title suggests the whole family, including Ant-Man's daughter, get sucked into the Quantum Realm when an experiment goes awry. Once they are there they first have to figure out how to survive, how to fight the evil man who can bring all parallel universes together for evil purposes, then get back to their own reality.Being a Scientist myself this type of fictional story is naturally appealing to me.

You certainly developed the piece of communications kit that lands everyone in the quantum soup, but the blame really must go to Peyton Reed and Jeff Loveness for directing and writing this latest emanation from Marvel's increasingly un-special film factory. It starts off with a great little device that could quickly put Papa John's out of business before we are sucked into the cantina from ""Star Wars"" (1977) where our recently arrived travellers find themselves pursued by the ridiculously un-menacing ""M. O. D. O. K"" - a sort of robotic killing version of the golden statue from the top of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" (1981) after it had had a good time with ""V. I. N. C. E. N. T"" from ""The Black Hole"" (1979) - before Michelle Pfeiffer ""Janet"" explains to her family (and to us) just what has led them to a predicament where they must avoid the evil clutches of ""Kang the Conqueror"" (Jonathan Majors). Now this gift that keeps on giving for this studio never struggles to impress visually, and the imagination of those who create these magical effects and alien shapes and sizes must be commended. However, this latest offering featuring, in my view, the weakest of their arsenal of characters is just entirely derivative and unremarkable. Aside from a very few bon-mots from Paul Rudd the dialogue is dry and the action scenes are all concentrated in one or two sequences whilst the rest of this serves as little better than colourful padding for the thinnest of storylines. Rudd is quite an unassuming kind of actor. Engaging, yes - but somehow just too lightweight for the grandness of the surrounding imagery. Michael Douglas (""Pym"") features sparingly and the cameo from Bill Murray might have worked better in ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" - here it is almost laughable. If these are to keep coming off the production line as thickly and quickly as seems likely, then somebody somewhere is going to have to spend much more effort on developing stronger and more compelling stories because the audiences are surely immune to the vibrancy of the special effects by now.

The cast is outstanding and everyone delivers a strong performance. Jonathan Majors was a tremendous villain and his mannerisms and the way he delivered his lines was perfect. The CGI and special effects to create the universe and the aliens in it were awesome. The makeup, masks and costumes were first rate. There were elements of the plot that were annoying, like how often Pfeiffer failed to inform her family about impending dangers, but the action sequences made up for where the storyline was flimsy.Overall, this is an above average addition to the super hero genre that I would score this a 6.5-7/10 and recommend seeing once.",16,21,kevin_robbins,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur131783850/?ref_=tturv_usr_38_t,17-Feb-23,

It calls out the complacency that can come with success in doing good. This also gets into communication and media, and their role in societal change.

7,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9032048/?ref_=tturv_perm_45,Typical and forgettable Marvel film,"I should start this review with the ending of the movie. After saving the world - again - Ant-Man is asking himself hard questions, like did he doom the entire Multiverse or not. He goes ""Nah, it's fine"" reminding himself that the world doesn't make sense and we shouldn't be asking so many questions. It was a clear jab at the people who would predictably criticize the film for its lack of meaning or consistency. It's also an advice for viewers going in, if they want to enjoy the film: leave your brain at the door.That being said, the film was a bunch of familiar faces playing characters that didn't seem to fit their history in a full CGI dream world. That is it. The movie could have just as well been an Alice in Wonderland sequel, where she shrinks and grows using magic mushrooms to kill a multiversal Red Queen. It makes no difference whatsoever.So was the film entertaining? Barely. The visuals were nice, things went pew pew and boom, had a lot of McGuffins and Deus ex Machinas, we even had entire CGI bars (and some actors) borrowed from whatever Marvel are doing in Star Wars. The story was clear, too, as nonsensical as it was. The characterization was bad, though. I mean Evangeline Lilly was barely in it (the haircut did NOT help), MODOK as Darren was pointless, Cassie was annoying as hell - that girl needs a good spanking - not taking responsibility for anything and then telling people what they should do, and Hank... Michael Douglas came, did his lines like a professional, went back home and got drunk questioning his life choices. Even Ant-Man was swinging wildly from courageous dad to hysterical buffoon. Paul Rudd did what he could with it, but it was bad.That leaves Kang. I have to say that I have a feeling every time I see Jonathan Majors on screen. It's a creepy, filthy feeling. It does not feel good. I don't know why and probably I will never know, with the personal issues the actor has nowadays and the publicity around it. But he was a good Kang. Better than in Loki, that's for sure, his acting was spot on. I feel like the script did him a disservice, because he could have easily become one of those legendary villains that makes you root for while hating him at the same time. I didn't see it in Loki, but I did see the potential of a great villain in this film. With the expected two end-credits scenes completely shattering that potential.The classic comic book villain histrionics have got to go. They don't help stories, they don't inspire anyone watching, they don't provide any useful hint for real life just a small emotional catharsis that feels shameful at the end, like a bad wank. It's a made-up fantasy of the bad guy emotionally collapsing under the weight of their defeat while heroes somehow derive strength from theirs. Is it that hard to care for your villain as you do for your hero, writers?""Kang will return"", says the last image of the film. I now doubt that very much.Bottom line: a forgettable and completely pointless film that manages to be somehow entertaining based almost exclusively on CGI and the charisma of the (poorly used) actors.

Humans are comparatively fragile, and they scream in pain as they're being trampled to death. Such verbalizing is strangely absent from this scene during ANT-MAN AND THE WASP: QUANTUM-MANIA.

Certain episodes of 'Loki' show it very well and 'Dr Strange in the Multiverse' is reasonably good. However, this mix of the quantum realm, multiverse, introduction of numerous characters, continuous sci-fi/action and frequent switching from comedy to drama results in a bit of spectacle-driven mess.Thankfully actors like Paul Rudd, Jonathan Majors, Michelle Pfieffer, Michael Douglas, Kathryn Newton, and Evangeline Lilly manage to elevate the script to an entertaining level with their performances.Visually it contains some great imaginative designs within the quantum realm, but I'm not sure if it compliments the best aspects of the Ant-Man and Wasp characters. Seeing them shrink and grow in real world environments like San Francisco provides endless fun, but in this setting it is not the same.The humour is hit and miss for me, done in that self aware Marvel style that attempts to develop dramatic moments only to shoot them down with various quips that make it all feel like a pointless exercise.

But relative to MCU standards, it's a bit underwhelming and feels like more of a throwaway movie than something memorable I will keep coming back to.My biggest issue is that I wasn't fully engaged for at least the first half of the movie. I was enjoying it but I wasn't locked in. The story was unfocussed. When the villain becomes prevalent, the movie jumps a level. But it doesn't completely make up for the much weaker first half.The other thing that surprised me was not being mesmerized by the visuals. It's very creative and I didn't notice poor CGI like some others. But it didn't wow me like it frequently does. Maybe we're just getting spoiled with the visuals in movies like Doctor Strange 2 and more recently Avatar 2.There is still a lot of good here. It's pretty funny but doesn't overdo it. This is the second movie in a row where the MCU seems to have dialed back on the ""insert joke here"" strategy. It's probably a result of the negative reaction from the cartoonish Thor 4. Also, I love the villain. I won't say who in case you're smart (and crazy) like me and don't watch trailers. But he's so damn awesome.As someone who loves almost everything in the MCU, Quantumania is near the bottom of my MCU rankings. And it's making me a little nervous that it comes only two movies after Thor 4 which is below it (5 stars). But I still have faith and am not joining the MCU doom and gloom crowd. Phase 4 has three of my favorite entries in the entire MCU (Shang-Chi, Loki S01, No Way Home) and I only disliked two (Eternals, Thor 4). They just need to be more consistent while also not playing it so safe.(3 viewings, opening Thursday IMAX 2/16/2023, IMAX 2/28/2023, 10/5/2023)",234,93,FeastMode,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur104603847/?ref_=tturv_usr_50_t,17-Feb-23,
6,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8949887/?ref_=tturv_perm_51,Lang Bang Kang?,"With the exception of ""Spiderman: No Way Home"", phase four of the Marvel Cinematic Universe was certainly more of a ""like rather than love"" period. Phase five, which starts with ""Quantumania"" is off to a similar start.Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) and his family are pulled back into the Quantum Realm and become embroiled in a civil uprising that is taking place there. The inhabitants are rebelling against Kang The Conqueror (Jonathan Majors) a Kang variant banished and trapped in the Quantum realm by other versions of himself. Though still unable to escape, thanks to help by Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) when she was trapped also, he was able to gain some of his powers and take control. Kang attempts to negotiate a deal with Lang, to recover a part of his ship and facilitate his departure.Interestingly, or perhaps confusingly would be a better term for it, one of my principal problems with this Ant-Man movie is that it doesn't really need to be about Ant-Man. The ability to get small, or big doesn't ever really play that much of a part in the plot, nor does his abilities as a skilled thief. It could just as easily have been any hero sent to do this. Visually, this also sacrifices any of those scenes from the first film, where the characters interact with a giant version of something. This is not to say that Rudd does anything wrong. He's just as charming and funny as he ever was. Johnathan Majors is great as is the rest of the Van Dyne/Lang family. (Incidentally Cassie keeps calling the Van Dyne's Grandma and Grandpa - which implies that Scott and Hope have married?).I really liked the idea of what they do with MODOK in this film, even if it's perhaps an underutilisation of a character they could have gotten more out of. It's clever how that's worked into the wider story. It's a frankly awful visual effect though, perhaps the worst in the whole MCU, worse than a ""She-Hulk"" walking wide shot.I don't know this for a fact, and I don't post reviews with spoilers, but it's hard to argue that some of the late moments of the film don't come from reshoots and their decision to pull away from a darker, sacrificial one, is the wrong one for me.I'm not going to stop seeing these film, I can't imagine even a really bad one would make me do that, but I sure wish they'd make another one I love pretty soon.",1,2,southdavid,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0715971/?ref_=tturv_usr_51_t,25-Mar-23,
5,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9552090/?ref_=tturv_perm_52,"""Quantumania"" is fun and places the heroes to explore a new world full of possibilities, but the generic and not ambitious visuals and action sequences frustrate the audience","Mixing a premise as absurd as it is silly in an envelope of childish fun among conceptual strangeness, ""Quantumania"" presents a narrative of comical misadventures and universal dramas about family and friendship. The film also creates good connections between the characters, especially in Scott's relationship with Cassie, and in the way Janet's secrets impact her relationship with Hope and Hank. But speaking of Hope, Wasp is unfortunately the film's weak link, and doesn't even justify her name in the title. Unfortunately, the script doesn't leave any space for the character, who seems like a mere supporting character with half a dozen lines in a film in which she was supposed to co-star. This probably happens for two reasons: the first is because the film needs to develop Cassie Lang, as Marvel supposedly has plans for her; and the second is because the nucleus to which she is inserted throughout the film, which is that of Hank and Janet, needs to give much more prominence to Mrs Pym, after all she is the viewer's link with Kang. Added to this, we have the entire presentation of the Quantum Realm and its inhabitants, which reduces the screen time of several of the characters, especially to maintain the entire focus of the protagonist on Ant-Man.Hope (Evangeline) is not unimportant, on the contrary, but performs the same function as Michael Douglas' character. Both are constant allies who gain a specific moment in which they become vital to the success of the good guys' plans. Paul Rudd, on the other hand, remains very comfortable as the Avenger who takes himself least seriously and, perhaps, the one in which bravery sounds closest to us. Scott is not the embodiment of an Apollonian superhero ideal; he is far from being a modern incarnation of Greco-Roman deities. He is a guy whose exceptionality remains camouflaged by his attitude close to conventional. In fact, the cast is the great value of the film that inaugurates the vaunted phase five of the Marvel Universe. And in the new stage we have not only the concept of the Multiverse, but the richness of the Quantum Realm. And just one additional comment about Cassie: Marvel will have to work on the character, who proves to be unbearable, appearing on screen as an idealistic young rebel in the name of the ""injustices"" she witnesses, even if she breaks the law to do so and, most importantly, due to the fact that she is another one of those boring and uncharismatic characters who is super intelligent and a prodigy, capable of creating in the basement of her house (and in secret) a super technological telescope capable of capturing the signal from the Quantum Realm. It's hard to digest and swallow this convenient genius.Following the line of the recent sequels to ""Thor: Love and Thunder"" and ""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness"", Jeff Loveness' script also addresses the effects after Thanos, and whether there is anything that can be extracted instantly and disguised by the childish humor with which the plot unfolds, Quantumania is a film about time, revenge and reparation, but this is far from any real weight that the text manages to achieve. This is largely because the drama is tied to a development that is not exciting for the characters, especially for Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer), who gains more prominence as a bridge to Kang (Jonathan Majors) and Cassie (Kathryn Newton), Scott's teenage daughter. And what is most impressive here is how much Peyton Reed believes he is directing a more mature and objective film for the beginning of a new era for the MCU, since it is just another false tip of what the studio has been doing: ""the more subtle humor and more drama"", in addition to several repetitions of other films as a world composition.Even if it is not affected by major holes, Loveness' script has some problems balancing the huge range of characters and events that it sets out to follow. Focused on the relationship between Scott (Rudd) and Cassie (Newton) and the threat that Kang (Jonathan Majors) represents to the multiverse, the script throws some of its characters to the side, making the Wasp played by Evangeline Lilly become little more than a cameo in his own film. Even M. O. D. O. K., a secondary antagonist whose debut in the MCU has been highly anticipated by fans, is reduced to mere comic relief minutes after his first appearance. Reed and Loveness' failure in Hope's participation is compensated, however, in Kang's construction. Played in a menacing way by Majors, the MCU's new villain arrives leaving his mark, being the film's highlight. Not only are his background and motivations well structured, but Jonathan Majors delivers an incredible performance as the villain. His Kang, more methodical and obsessed than actually cruel, oscillates from moments of control of the situation to the most complete despair and pure anger in a fraction of seconds, and the actor has complete command of every nuance of the character. Even though he's not a two-meter-tall purple alien, he imposes fear. A primordial fear. Human. The final confrontation between the antagonist and the heroes, in fact, is one of the most impactful since the Mad Titan snapped his fingers in ""Avengers: Infinity War"".Returning to talking about world building, it becomes terribly comical when we enter the Quantum Realm and realize that there are visual and narrative nods that refer to ""Arthur and the Minimoys"", ""A Bug's Life"", ""Sharkboy and Lavagirl"", ""Avatar "" and ""Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith"", but there is nothing that points to an effort by the studio to be creative, or in fact, that it is seeking to have more identity. The setting to which the quintet moves is a sumptuous collection of specimens and forms that denotes creativity. Even though the film has an excess of digital layers (there are few organic textures in the scene), the artificiality does not bother or compromise. But the idea when drawing from other fantasy and science fiction films is to create the illusion that new elements are being worked on in the MCU, however, it all boils down to laziness and convenience of making a visually and narratively calculated feature, driven to the exhaustion of its formula. Therefore, there is no excitement left for a film that also deals with the field of possibilities and mirrors parts of other films instead of creating, at least, its own characteristic.Are the jokes surrounding the bizarre MODOK (Corey Stoll) a little tiresome? They are. Does the action never get as exciting as in other Marvel books? Yes, it is true. All scenes seem pasteurized and without a trace of originality, which reduces much of the production's impact. That feeling of an entire film filmed on green screen increasingly tires the viewer and leaves productions without identity. Furthermore, the film has a subtext that antagonizes centralizing fascists and community socialists. Cassie demonstrates from the beginning a social conscience linked to everyday problems - while she worries about the homeless, Scott is very attached to the extraordinary narrative of saving the world. Well then. Faced with the antagonist with genocidal intentions, filmed at one point as if he were Hitler organizing Nazi troops (definitely, this shot is similar to the records of great dictators in History), the one who calls for rebellion is precisely the girl concerned about the world at its lowest. Details. There is even a mention of the benefits of socialism spoken loudly by Dr. Hank Pym. A totally cliché message that nods to the more progressive side of Marvel, increasingly present in its productions, especially after phase 4.So far, nothing new for the most attentive viewers.""Quantumania"" builds the villain and the empire (pardon the pun) around him as the great threat that could finally take Ant-Man and the Wasp out of the ""cafe au lait"" category. The problem is that not even a mission that involves the death of entire universes is enough for production to leave its comfort zone. The obstacles presented to the heroes are accompanied by almost instantaneous solutions, as if afraid to challenge the audience. A fear that makes no sense, considering that this is the third Ant-Man film - and the 31st in the MCU. At this point, audiences know what to expect from a Marvel film, and lowering the stakes isn't exactly the way to respond. If the film falls short in its mission to validate the franchise in its universe, the film succeeds in expanding the heroic family dynamics. The relationship between the characters and the distribution of their screen time keeps the story captivating until the conclusion. With that, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" comes to an end with a mix of sensations. Far from being a catastrophe, the production is fun and places beloved heroes to explore a new world full of possibilities. Even though it wasted the chance to close the trilogy with the grandiose epic that its protagonists so long for, the production is entertaining enough to avoid being ranked among the low points of the MCU.",0,0,fernandoschiavi,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur33162918/?ref_=tturv_usr_52_t,9-Jan-24,

You ruined Star Wars, so instead of losing another billion on a new chapter, you disguised a MCU movie into an unofficial ""Episode X...Size Does Matter.""Actually, this is literally Star Wars, Star Trek for the villain and a Marvel movie all combined into one. Heck, one character was totally using the Force.I'm uncertain the reason I rated this higher than the previous two Ant-Mans (which I thought were just okay, but enjoyable) is because my expectations were INCREDIBLY low. To the point, I thought I was going to hate this. Though, yes, it definitely has its issues. Comedy, or the lack thereof, was one.For a series that thrives on comedy, mostly from Paul Rudd and definitely Michael Peña, this one had so many jokes, but only 1/3 worked. I didn't hate the jokes; they just were mostly DOA. And I have NEVER known the great Bill Murray to be this incredibly unfunny. Well, to be fair, he wasn't funny in Charlie's Angels (2000) and Ghostbusters (2016.) Here he served his purpose and couldn't be less Bill Murray.What also didn't help was the lack of Michael Peña. He had thee very best scene of the Original Ant-Man and every other character in this third movie tried to take his place annnnd failed. I mean, again, I laughed a few times. Just cringed at the lack of thought they put in most of the ""humor.""The movie doesn't waste any time getting the family that talks to ants together shot into the Quantum Realm. Trapped and separated, the group tries to reunite and go back home, only to run into a pretty good villain, Kang, hellbent on joining them to seek massive revenge.I did like this entry. Especially if you view it through Star Wars Eyes. It's just a fun romp with excellent acting and wonderful screentime from Michelle Pfeiffer and Jonathan Majors as Kang The Conqueror. Heck, Michael Douglas was also fun to see on screen - I'll never tire of seeing him.The only ones I thought were meh, but serviceable were Ant-Man, himself, Paul Rudd who seriously didn't seem like his heart was into this, Evangeline Lilly as Plain Jane Wasp and the annoying, zero-personality daughter played by Kathryn Newton.Also, a few of the creatures were pretty fun and unique. Well, except BIG HEAD. That design was just incredibly awful. Mimicked a ""live action"" Humpty Dumpty with a human head in place of the egg. Looked disgusting, cheap and completely out of place even in this Realm of weird and exotic creatures.DEFINTIELY leave your brain at the door and don't ask too many questions. It's at the same level as Black Adam (except with WAY better FX) and Thor: Love and Thunder. If you liked those superhero movies, you'll most likely have a good time here.***Final Thoughts: I was warned I absolutely need to see the final two end-credit scenes.

Our heroes get sucked into the Quantum realm through sheer stupidity, and there's a whole world and secrets to reveal and blah blah blah.Much of this seems designed to create a bunch of cool visuals, with unusual scenery and strange humanoids. It's all perfectly fine, but none of it makes you go ""wow, how beautiful"" or ""wow, how imaginative."" It's just a bunch of random stuff in a random world visited in a random fashion.The most random thing is probably Bill Murray, who has one irrelevant scene apparently because he had a day free and someone was like, hey, why don't we stick Bill Murray in this?The best performances are Kathryn Newton as the feisty, likeable Cassie, and Jonathan Majors as Kang. Majors is particular impressive, being one of these villains who don't see themselves as a villain and speak about their plans in a persuasive, sincere way that almost sucks you in.As good as Majors is, though, the character is underbaked. He keeps talking about not living through time linearly but it's not clear what that means, since he doesn't expect anything that happens. The best he does is, after it happens, he says, ""yeah, I knew all this"" which is as persuasive as any time some dude says, ""Yeah, I totally knew that the whole time.""There's not much comedy, what there is isn't that funny. There's a bunch of special effects action, but none of it is that impressive. There's not an original moment in the movie.Still, it's watchable.

Ant-Man & the Wasp: Quantumania is a lifeless & lacklustre entry that has the ambition but not the vision to bring its quantum universe to life with any cinematic flair and isn't just the weakest of the three Ant-Man films but is arguably the worst offering in the shared universe.Directed by Peyton Reed, the story finds Scott Lang & his family accidentally transported to the quantum realm where they discover a new threat. All the elements that made its predecessors fun, lighthearted & small-scale adventures is gone in this latest outing as it comes packed with terrible visuals, cringe writing, uninspiring action & bland storytelling. Even the world building & character designs have a juvenile quality to them.Strongly abiding by the Marvel formula and deficient in even the basic filmmaking aspects, the film never manages to create any sort of intrigue or interest despite the uncharted territory the plot takes place in. The dialogues are atrocious, its attempts at humour fall flat every time and the performances are mediocre at best. Much is said about Jonathan Majors' impressive input but his work stands out only coz the rest are much worse.Overall, Ant-Man & the Wasp: Quantumania is the latest eyesore from the crumbling franchise that's been on a downhill journey for some time now and may have just hit its lowest point with their latest run-of-the-mill garbage.

This was literally one of Marvel's dullest and most unnecessary movies to date. The entire story was cliched and predictable, and there was more CGI than there was any type of interesting story, let alone one with any substance. Even the normally awesome and hilarious humor in the previous installments was absent in this one. Almost the entire film is taking place inside a CGI story, so there was no need for any movie sets or locations... this was all green-screen nonsense.

During dinner at the home of love interest Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) and her parents Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and the recently returned Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer), Cassie showcases a device that can map the Quantum Realm where Janet was lost by sending signals which Janet is none too happy about for reasons she doesn't share. The device opens up a worm hole sucking in Scott, Cassie, Hope, Hank, and Janet sending them to the Quantum Realm with Scott and Cassie in one area and Hope, Hank, and Janet in another, where they soon find themselves caught between a resistance between the denizens of the Quantum Realm and the tyrannical despot Kang the Conqueror (Johnathan Majors) who has a connection to Janet.Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is the third film in the Ant-Man series and the first film in the fifth phase of the MCU. The third Ant-Man movie was intended from its inception to be larger scale with director Peyton Reed stating his intention was ""a massive world-building undertaking"" citing the aesthetics of Heavy Metal magazines as an influence. You can't fault Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania for its ambition, but in execution it has many of the flaws of Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness without some of the redeeming points that compensated for that film's messy screenplay.I will say once again Paul Rudd is good as Ant-Man with his likable down to earth charm making him an endearing presence in this universe. I also liked Kathryn Newton as Scott's daughter Cassie with the two having a nice natural chemistry and still building on the father/daughter dynamic that has been a strong emotional core of this franchise. The movie is also a bright and colorful film with lots of details and some inspired setpieces such as a scene involving multiple possible versions of Scott Lang or hyperintelligent ants but unfortunately the story and the nuts and bolts are where we begin to see the weaknesses. Quantumania is much more serious minded entry for Ant-Man in the same way that Thor: Ragnarok was a tonal departure from the prior Thor movies, but where it worked there by refreshing the character, here the tonal shift feels like it takes out a major part of the Ant-Man movie's appeal. The movie also has way too much stuffed into it as it's more focused on setting up Kang the Conqueror than exploring the Quantum Realm and while the Quantum Realm looks visually interesting, there's not much world building and the denizens of the realm they introduce just sort of get overtaken by the visual noise that makes this feel less like an Ant-Man movie and more like a Star Wars clone. We also have Corey Stoll returning as Darren Cross who is now M. O. D. O. K. And it's honestly a lateral move as he was underwhelming as a character in the first film and he's not much more interesting here.Quantumania isn't the worst MCU movie, but it's definitely one of the lower ranking entries in that it's so stuffed without much development on its own story and more focused on setting up plot points for other films. It's perfectly serviceable even if not particularly exceptional.",1,0,IonicBreezeMachine,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur117926588/?ref_=tturv_usr_72_t,18-May-23,

I am sure the CGI'd butt cheeks of how did that pass quality control M. O. D. O. K, a little hole loving alien who utters the phrase ""milk juice"", the site of Douglas strutting into another mindless big city battle with a horde of ants flanking him in what's akin to the worst version of The Charge of Rohirrim you could conjure up or just the general sense that no one cares enough to even pretend will surely do the trick.It's been an incredible run but now all we can do is sit back and watch as the MCU gathers speed and launches itself out of the water for one spectacular if miss judged jump.Final Say -Ladies and gentleman it's time for Thor: The Dark World, The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2 and Eternals to move aside, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is now the worst MCU film yet with all the signs pointing to it likely moving aside itself as the ship it's a part of slowly but surely sinks.1 1/2 over priced coffees out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)",101,92,eddie_baggins,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur8462477/?ref_=tturv_usr_73_t,16-Feb-23,

The created living entities of the quantum universe are more anthropomorphic (human-based) perhaps to be more relatable to children does not reflect the diversity or original forms of life or new-life that would really make this film stellar. As even as special as the set designs and special effects make for a gorgeous setting, there is still room for more crisp, detailed and immersive design work. Some backgrounds end up being mere basic animation projections that do not come up to the level expected of contemporary Marvel productions.

Why am I saying that? Well, for starters, the story's been written and narrated like a prologue, more like an introduction to the freshest super villain of the Marvel Cinematic Universe than a movie that is solely based on Ant-Man and his heroic adventures.I would go as far as to say that the entire family of Lang was treated like supporting members of the cast, that too in their own franchise, as the narrative was too invested in giving Kang all the limelight; he has got more cool scenes to act in, he's been lent stronger dialogues, and because of all that in the end he turned out to be a character with maturity and a certain level of depth with a clear goal and purpose unlike Ant-Man or any of his kith and kin.Now, is that good or bad? Actually, it's both.On one hand, Ant-Man has been treated like a trivial addition rather than lead protagonist, but on the other hand, we've got ourselves a great new villain who stands firm and could hold his own.

I'll be honest, I've been checked out of the last ones as it feels like they are just introducing characters and not progressing to a major story. That is until this one. What I will say though is that I've enjoyed my time. It just hasn't inspired me to want to continue watching the MCU output. Something else is that Ant-Man and The Wasp make fun movies, especially since I like Paul Rudd.Now for this one, we are after the events of Endgame. Life has gone back to semi-normal. Scott Lang (Rudd) is happy with Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly). They have a makeshift family with Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Cassie Lang (Kathryn Newton). Hank is working with Cassie who wants to know more about the Quantum Realm. Janet doesn't want to talk about it and is closed off there. Cassie is also getting into trouble as she is socially conscious.Cassie created a device that can search the Quantum Realm. This gets this group into trouble as they get sucked in. It is now that Janet reveals what she did when she was trapped there. She met someone else in a similar situation. She helped them, but she saw what was in their heart. Also, what their plan is if they ever get out. This character is from the future and named Kang (Jonathan Majors). He is behind the Langs, Van Dyne and Hank getting sucked into the Quantum Realm.That should recap and get you up to speed with what this movie is doing. What I'm glad about is that we finally get who our next major villain to replace Thanos, Kang the Conqueror. I don't know much about this guy. What I do know is that it makes people excited. This seems like it fits since Kang is a time traveler who is destroying other timelines in the multiverse. I'm excited to see where things will go now.Outside of introducing this villain, this was my least favorite of the Ant-Man movies. It isn't the acting. Rudd is solid along with Lilly, Douglas, Pfeiffer, Majors and Newton. If anything, Rudd doesn't bring as much humor as normal. We get back Corey Stoll in an odd role. I love that they used M. O. D. O. K. The execution on screen though wasn't great. We also got a cameo from Bill Murray which was wild. I also liked Katy M. O'Brian, William Jackson Harper and the voice of David Dastmalchian. The acting is solid, but it takes a backseat to the action and effects.I'll then finish this out with the filmmaking. What I'll give credit to here is creating this fictional and smaller world of the Quantum Realm. There is limitless things that can be done here. I'll also credit the effects. This is CGI heavy, but they do look good thanks to the Disney money. Not everything though. I do want to say that. Other than that, the action sequences are good and the soundtrack works.I'm recommending this to MCU fans who want to continue the story. I don't think this is a great film, but where it goes from here has my interest piqued finally.My Rating: 7 out of 10.",2,3,Reviews_of_the_Dead,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur23318905/?ref_=tturv_usr_76_t,22-Jun-23,
10,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8875216/?ref_=tturv_perm_77,Best MCU movie Since Endgame.,"All that is out the window with Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, the third entry in the series and the first to kick off an MCU phase instead of capping one. Not only does director Peyton Reed's movie take place almost exclusively in the Quantum Realm (exploring it much more extensively than ever before), but it also puts Scott Lang/Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) and company up against the next major Marvel menace: Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors), a power-mad tyrant who can move through all of space and time. He threatens not just ""our"" reality, but every other one out there. Most of the film takes place at a far remove from the Marvel Universe we know, down in the subatomic Quantum Realm that characters from previous films have visited (Ant-Man), gotten stuck in for decades (Ant-Man and the Wasp) or used as a series of temporal highway bypasses on their way to saving the universe (Avengers: Endgame). Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania has just enough entertaining moments and a heartfelt family story, plus knockout performances in Michelle Pfeiffer's Janet van Dyne and Jonathan Majors' Kang the Conqueror, to make up for its more underdeveloped aspects. The exploration of its central themes, new characters, and the Quantum Realm itself only goes skin deep, leaving it feeling high on spectacle but low on substance. Even so, Quantumania works as a culmination of the Ant-Man series, a way to start things in motion for Phase 5, and a promising roadmap of where the Multiverse Saga is going. Of course, many MCU fans may wait and see what audience scores are like. Generally speaking, audience scores trend higher than critics for most superhero offerings, and I would probably expect that to be the case here. But I would be surprised if this was a huge disparity as this always seemed like a pretty risky film. I also think it may be worth noting that so many new Marvel films keep popping up in the bottom ten here, like the even higher profile Thor: Love and Thunder and Multiverse of Madness. The MCU does feel like it's has its magic in phase 4 here. Serenely untroubled by pressures to break box office records or win Oscars, the Ant-Man films seem content to be clever entertainments with heart, but not so much that they become cloying. From the size jokes to the running gags to the casting of Rudd, who has spent his career behaving as if he's a random regular guy who stumbled into stardom and finds it all quite silly, the series manages to be light but not inconsequential, whether a given scene is sentimental (anything involving Scott and Cassie) or cheerfully deranged (the climatic fight at the end of the first movie atop a Thomas the Tank Engine train set). Ant-Man is officially a member of the MCU's starting lineup, the Avengers, but feels like a replacement player who gets a text when Thor calls in sick. This new movie validates Scott's not-quite-insecurity (he's not deep enough to be existentially tormented) by having him get mistaken for other superheroes. He takes it in stride. Two films ago, he got fired from Baskin-Robbins, and before that, he was in jail. Happiness, like size, is a matter of perspective.",10,34,moviesfilmsreviewsinc,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur59184301/?ref_=tturv_usr_77_t,17-Feb-23,

Based on the trailers, I didn't have high expectations and I was still disappointed and underwhelmed, as I loved the first Ant-Man and liked the follow up. That said it was still OK.There are somethings I liked, Paul Rudd was his usual likeable self. Jonathan Majors was a decent enough Kang, at least for the first half of the movie. There is a good family drama underneath all the cgi nonsense, that really should have been the movies main plot point. It works when it's about the family. I thought Michelle Pfeiffer was great and I really liked Michael Douglas, too!!Did they recast the daughter??What I didn't like, was once it got down to it,in the second half, Kang was just another disposable Marvel bad guy. Bill Murray was a distraction and this will not help his career.A big problem for me was it bottled what could have been a great ending. It looked like it was leading to a something I would have liked and then it went in another direction. I also would have liked to have spent more time with Jentorra played by Katy O' Brian. She has a decent sized role, I wanted more of her.All in all, I'm it's down there with the bottom half of the MCU movies for me, but not right down there with Thor 2 and Iron Man 2There were seven other people in my screening.

It surpassed my expectations, to be honest. Great cast, entertaining action, super interesting world building (my favourite from the MCU for a while, in that regard) and the humour is good.Star of the show in my opinion is Michelle Pfeiffer. I don't recall her standing out in 'Ant-Man and the Wasp', but here she's excellent from beginning to end. Elsewhere, Jonathan Majors is brilliant - great to see that guy all over the place recently. Paul Rudd remains a strong lead, while the likes of Michael Douglas and Kathryn Newton are positives too.Love the Quantum Realm setting. I'm nothing like an MCU nut, I'm only aware of the films, so didn't know what to expect, but the place looks fantastic - from the enviroment to the creatures; shoutout Veb.

Despite sharing the title Evangeline Lily gets very little to do but Michael Douglas is the scene stealer with the best humour and a lot less expositional dialogue this time around.Kang is a generically evil character here but in the hands of Jonathan Majors he is an absolute force of nature, elevating this one note character into a softly spoken menace who brings the film to life whenever he's on screen.Peyton Reed's direction is fine, it looks competent overall with a few visually impressed moments but struggles to establish real scale within the quantum realm. The CG is the same as it always with these, hit and miss throughout and alternating from impressive to awful within the same scene.The music by Christophe Beck is a bit of a letdown, none of that playfulness or sense of fun that makes the previous Ant-Man scores so memorable is here and it only really comes to life during the credits.",2,2,masonsaul,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur94560739/?ref_=tturv_usr_81_t,18-Feb-23,

A spin on the Ant-man franchise and for me was a hit! Feels like a contextual vehicle for Kang the Conqueror. Some elements don't quite work. But those are minimal, and I didn't leave the cinema effected negatively by them in any way. Scale is big acting was impressive! Comedy aspect to the franchise still still very alive. It all worked and flowed in a fun weird way. Nothing mind blowing.Synopsis:
Super-Hero partners Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) and Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) return to continue their adventures as Ant-Man and the Wasp. Together, with Hope's parents Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), and Scott's daughter Cassie Lang (Kathryn Newton), the family finds themselves exploring the Quantum Realm, interacting with strange new creatures and embarking on an adventure that will push them beyond the limits of what they thought possible.",99,120,andrewchristianjr,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur79190944/?ref_=tturv_usr_90_t,15-Feb-23,
6,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9952226/?ref_=tturv_perm_91,Over-CGI'ed and Underwhelming,"Ant-Man 3 unfortunately falls flat despite its high aspirations. One of the film's major drawbacks is its heavy reliance on CGI, which quickly becomes overwhelming. The constant barrage of digital effects lacks the charm and inventiveness of its predecessors, often leading to scenes that feel visually cluttered and devoid of genuine impact. The CGI-heavy sequences, while some technically impressive, fail to create the immersive experience one would hope for.Additionally, the narrative struggles to hold interest. The plot meanders without delivering substantial excitement or emotional depth. The story's attempts at grandeur feel hollow, as the film fails to fully engage with its characters or develop its central conflict in a meaningful way. The stakes feel unearned, and the attempts at humor and dramatic moments often fall flat. The film's villains, while visually striking, lack the menace or complexity needed to make them compelling. Their motivations and actions feel clichéd and underdeveloped, leaving the conflict feeling somewhat one-dimensional.In summary, Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania is a visually overdone and narratively uninspired entry in the Marvel franchise. Its reliance on CGI and lackluster story make it a disappointing follow-up that doesn't live up to the series' previous charm.",1,0,Abdulxoxo,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur106279729/?ref_=tturv_usr_91_t,13-Aug-24,
4,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9005705/?ref_=tturv_perm_92,A wave of exhausation has taken over the MCU! [+43%],"The MCU formula needs a major revamp. They're basically making Antman/Scott Lang look like a chump here, just to elevate his daughter Cassie to a generic, whiny girlboss. Hope doesn't have much to do in the film except in the climax, while Dr. Hank Pym looks absolutely bored. The whole film rides on two people really: Janet (Pfeiffer) and Kang (Majors). And frankly, between the two, I did not enjoy Majors' performance in this (he was fantastic in Creed III). I understand that one film isn't enough to build a supervillain, but Marvel surely knew how to do things better before. Kang seems to lack a definite purpose (other than the hunger for power) in annexing the multiverse, as opposed to Thanos who had a valid reason.The worst bits of writing go to Cassie Lang (Newton) who's only good at making her dad look bad (even when he was pivotal in overturning the Blip) in the present, and doing stupid things like sending signals to bad guys in the Quantum Realm. The CGI is a mess, and makes you wonder why the studio spent $ 200 million to create such a bizarre-looking film. Also, why explain major plot-points in a matter of seconds whereas entire scenes are wasted in the name of uninspiring humour? Interest levels in the MCU continue to wane, with this entry being one of the worst they've come up with thus far.P. S - M. O. D. O. K can go suck on a toe!P. P.

6,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8886317/?ref_=tturv_perm_93,It was worth it but doesn't fill our excitement.,"Even if it's on an incredibly small scale, something significant is happening in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The third installment of the Paul Rudd-starring series about a divorced father turned ex-con with a remarkable shrinking suit, Quantumania is also the first movie in Phase 5 of the MCU's overarching, 31 movies and 8 TV shows strong storyline. And it is important. Even if understanding the implications would necessitate a doctorate in molecular physics.Focusing on the pleasant San Francisco day makes it much simpler to imagine Scott and the rest of the lovely blended Lang-Pym-van-Dyne family enjoying their happy post-Blip life. That is, until they are drawn into the ""Quantum Realm"" of the subatomic realm by a teenager fiddling with a MacGuffin device. Why does that matter? One benefit is that Michelle Pfeiffer will get more screen time since she does a great job of putting all the crazy science fiction in emotional reality in her role as the original quantum investigator Janet van Dyne. She is just a working mother who feels guilty and believes that protecting her family by hiding her own previous traumas will help.The Quantum Realm is unquestionably worth visiting, with its microfauna forests and pulsating glowing creatures. Star Wars parallels that were sparked by the trailer are neither unfair nor off-putting, but this prolonged stay does rob us of some of the core Ant-Man movie pleasures: there are no recognisable, everyday objects to size up or down. Whatever strange but unexpectedly prevalent miniaturist kink ""smol"" sights appeal to is thus painfully unfulfilled.Also, there is no room for beloved side characters like Agent Woo, played by Randall Park, or Luis, Lang's former cellmate, with his heist-planning antics and famously drawn-out tales. Everything must make way for Jonathan Majors' eagerly awaited debut as Kang the Conqueror, Phase Five's new Big Bad.Which leads us to the crucial question that may affect your upcoming multiplex visits: Does Kang bang? He does, indeed. In The Force Awakens, Adam Driver was an emotionally charged it-boy, and Majors possesses that same energy. Observe how, even while he throttles his victims, his eyes frequently become wet with pity. The MCU moves forward relentlessly through ""phases"" and ""sagas,"" but what's the point if there's no opportunity to sit, think, and have a laugh with old friends? Kang would undoubtedly grasp this fundamental complaint about this effective movie product in his more melancholy moments.",3,1,Mysterygeneration,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur104853183/?ref_=tturv_usr_93_t,22-Feb-23,

My official score would be about an 8.8 out of 10 stars or maybe a 9.2 out of 10 stars, just because twice in the beginning of the film a character keeps something a secret for no real reason. But after that it is smooth sailing! Kang is a freaking beast! The special effects are great, the action doesn't disappoint, you get everything! A slugfest, shoot outs, battlefield action. They really did this well. The humor this there but doesn't take away from the movie's grand scope. This is the kind of movie you will be mad at yourself for if you do not watch it on a big screen! Characters are well developed. You do not have to worry about any kind of forced political or social messages, so yes it is safe for kids to watch.Who are these reviewers ranking it so low and why??? What movie did they watch? Trust me, this is an outstanding Marvel movie. It makes up for Thor 4 being trash. I liked the first Ant-Man movie, I honestly hardly even remember the second Ant-Man movie; but for Ant-Man 3 I can tell you this feels more like an Avengers movie because of how epic it feels and I am not complaining! Totally worth the price of admission! I can not watch to watch this again. I might even rewatch Loki season 1 before I watch this when it drops on Disney plus.

While being carried on the back of a strong performance by Jonathan Majors, Ant-Man: Quantumania is strictly a setup film, which is somewhat pointless, because it sets up what Marvel fans already know. Regardless of leaving little to no impact, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania's visuals are where it shines, literally and figuratively. In a film that takes place almost entirely in a CGI world, Marvel creates its own Star Wars and perfects every minute computer generated detail.Picking up after the events of Avengers: Endgame, with the entire world rehabilitating, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania kicks off (or flies off, because... ants). The audience sees the new luxurious life of Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) - Hero, father and self-proclaimed ""author."" The story quickly introduces the new struggle Scott has for raising his newly teenage daughter, Cassie Lang (Kathryn Newton). When Cassie reveals she has been tampering with Quantum Realm technology, it's too late. The whole Ant-Man crew gets shrunken down into the Quantum Realm (a subatomic world beneath Earth). The rest of the story follows the whole family venturing to find a way out of the realm, while Kang the Conqueror hunts them relentlessly.For the past couple years, Marvel has had major controversy regarding their CGI and VFX artists (mainly with their Disney+ shows). At least for Ant-Man: Quantumania, they seem to be back on track, or starting to be. The images are impeccable and matched with a strong score; the auditory and visual experience is automatically enhanced. IMAX is the correct way to view the film. Despite the irrelevant plot, Jonathan Majors conquers the show. He emphasizes the true power of Kang, with a blood-curdling scream that'll make sure he is thought about well after the credits roll. Although, the film fails to utilize him to the extent they could have, leaving the audience wanting more, and not in a positive way.Like all the other films put through the Marvel formula, this film does not disappoint with its fair share of comedy, foul language and violence. When dealing with a villain known for annihilating entire worlds and timelines, of course the audience will see a lot more than a simple punch thrown on the big screen. In terms of gore however, it does not go there to a large extent. Underneath the antics, the story pairs with a large theme of family, and teaches the moral that love of all kinds always perseveres.I give Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania 3 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 8 to 18, plus adults.

People clamored for the next movie and I would rush out to the theatre the first week to go and see it because I knew, I KNEW, that whatever you put on screen, it was going to be fun. It might not make me think too much, it might not evoke deep thought or emotion, but it'd be pure fun. Then came COVID and my faith was shaken. It's funny, because there was a line from Iron Man 2, ""If you make God bleed, then people will no longer believe in him."" Marvel, you're bleeding.Quantomania is... Fine. There were moments that were funny, but beyond that this movie was utter nonsense. There were no stakes, no sense of what was going on, if anything mattered, it didn't even try to... WHY WERE THERE PEOPLE DOWN THERE?! The only real saving graces here were in the actors. Rudd is as charming and funny as ever. Douglas had some amazing moments that were just really fun. And Majors. Wow. Great great job. I have questions as to how his powers shifted throughout the movie, but that's not him. He gave that character some serious gravitas and interest.For the time being, Marvel was still able to put enough fun in this movie to overwhelm all the stupid, but only just. Those margins are getting thinner and thinner. As someone who has loved these characters since childhood, long before the MCU was a thing, I really hope they sort themselves out because I would love to return to the days when these movies were just raw fun.",3,1,questl-18592,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur102601261/?ref_=tturv_usr_96_t,25-Sep-23,

As always with Marvel, the abundance of digital effects makes the film a visually stunning journey with settings, creatures, and characters reminiscent of the world of Star Wars or the wacky misadventures of Futurama. The group consisting of Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly, Michael Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer and Kathryn Newton are a huge star for the film. The introduction of Kang after the Loki series is already a glimpse of what is to come in this phase 5 of the MCU, which is a very good start to start this next phase. Modok is quite a bizarre and cartoonish character, but he has a certain air of the original Modok. One detail that can be noted is that unlike the previous Ant-Man movies, there is a little less humor here and more seriousness. Even so, Scott Lang's humor continues to hold. This movie is a very good start to phase 5 and an amazing viewing experience that is endlessly entertaining.

8,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8875545/?ref_=tturv_perm_98,"Big, Small, Antman's Got A Little of It All And Sometimes Too much","LIKES:The Graphics/World Design
-Marvel really has a great budget to create worlds from our imagination and this installment continues to make it happen.-Lavish colors, odd beasts, a world that Strange World was trying to make but with more thought and layering.-Great cultures, a comic book sense of atmosphere, and a new world to which lots of foundations may just build from in the future.-Feels like a strong mash up of Star Wars, Marvel, and Battlestar with pinches of other movies to help spice up a few things with them as well. Nice references indeed.The Comedy At Times
-The comedy is awesome often thanks to writing and Paul Rudd making the lines come to life.-The snarky humor and sarcasm works very well, and I truly did laugh a bunch at how he just owns AntMan and makes it work on levels to be fun.-There are plenty of aggressive lines that will be there for people to enjoy, several filled with cursing so caution, but it works when in balance and timed just right.-And some running gags add a little spice to the mix as well, and that was awesome to say the least.-Overall, the comedy works for me, but there are limitations to be mentioned at a later section.The Action At Times
-The action does have these moments that show Marvel can still make a good fight.-Choreography has some flavor, the powers are fun, and the use of that awesome design comes out pretty well.-Several moments have some impressive strategy behind it, and again surprises me with how some of these stunt people can move.-And there is musical and visual support to help make everything come to life and have that movie magic that we love in these films.-Throw in some emotional moments that work to add that bite and edge, and several comedic moments, and AntMan 3 really helps add a little more sauce to the factor that many come to these movies for.The Character Development At Times
-Kang is the lead for me on this film, in just how much they took the one moment we had with him before and amplifies it so well. He gets a lot of time to flourish and I totally agree that he is worth it.-As for Scott, again he and Janet get some surprising levels that I love and these moments really help amplify those who seem somewhat forgettable, a joke of the movie, and really bring them to the forefront to be the heroes we want.The Acting
-Marvel is not often loaded with duds, so I can't say that I was surprised to see a strong hand played for this film.-I'd say just about everyone hits their mark, but I have limited room, so I'll stick to the three top listed and go from there.-Rudd is hilarious, hands down a solid balance of comedy, emotion, and bravado that establishes the themes of this movie and often does not stray into overacting. So natural in his delivery he keeps entertainment and drama in check.-Lilly was fine in her time on the screen, but I can't say that Hope had the same punches or influence on me as the past. She seemed a little laid back, lackluster, and then finally picks it up but not to the degree I've seen her in other films.-Majors though, wow, Majors kills this role. The man knows how to articulate movements, add elements to his speech and craft this role so well. Kang is such a layered villain and Majors destroys it with the way he incorporates so much into one man. What a fantastic ability to do so much.DISLIKES:The Pace Is A Fast
-Normally this is a good thing, and by the end you'll see why it might be a bit bad.-Quantumania really has a lot of things launching from it, and not everything was fleshed out, thought through, or detailed as Phase 1 and 2 were able to do for the most part.-It was great to see so much, and yet, it moved a tad too fast for me to really get everything down and have that commitment.-Perhaps they tried to launch too much and had they toned back, several parts of this could have had a consistently strong bite that these climactic moments had.-Though my bladder was happy, I think this one needed to slow down a bit in my opinion.The Character Development Is Bland At Times
-With that pace, some development felt a bit simplified and lacking.-Hope gets little for me in terms of truly worthwhile investment, and Hank is more comedic than truly amazing, lost to a secondary character status.-Several other new members are there to have an inconsistent bite, and though there are shining moments, there are sadly not the same speed that I like in my character stories.-Thus, these blander moments aren't the worst, but given the magic of Avengers and Civil War, I guess I expected more in this tale.Many Elements Feel Simplified:
-Again, there is a lot of potential in this movie, and yet... did it fully achieve it?-Some levels, yes, there are these champion aspects I wish I got more time with and had smoother transitions.-And yet other things just felt so watered down. Several cultural tribes and relationships. New characters who had abilities to dig out things, but were comedic only, and even several elements of exploration were lost.-All this build up at times sometimes just flops out and again, we are left with a bare bone, C-grade means to tell the tale.The Comedy Forced Sometimes
-There is plenty of good laughs to be had and I admit again I chuckled a bunch, especially some of the adult jokes.-But... again we have been robbed of balance and sometimes the comedy tried too hard to be funny for me and tripped up the momentum to be had.-A running gag about how to punch sometimes flopped for me, other times it was just stopping to joke during an action scene, and other times was just a joke going too far for me that it lost its edge for me.-I'm not saying it reached levels of Thor, but... I can also say sometimes the edge needed to win and stay while the jokes were left behind.The Action Could Have Been More
-Again, there are moments where the action is on fire and some of the best I've seen in a while.-But that doesn't mean it approaches the level that other films have done and given the buildup, I guess I feel more of it than other films.-Many action sequences last less than 5 minutes, with a tad simplification and a minimization to the chaos they could have had.-A few bad guys to beat down or at least scare off? Maybe a run in with Kang earlier and fleeing from him to an extent far less trivial.-And they still have not gotten big battles with lots of pieces the due time and natural development I know they can do.-Thus, the action could have been more in my opinion.The VERDICT
The opening hand for Phase 5 is heavy and truly a visionary wonder to behold. AntMan's third trip to the screens is loaded with a bunch of things you might like in regards to your movie with action, comedy, edge, emotion, and stakes that have been absent in a lot of Marvel's productions. It really has a lot of good in my opinion and has done the job of set up and entertainment to the point that there is a lot to uncover. Some good character use, a dab of emotion, and some focus on evolving characters is a nice foundation, and the comedic antics with the comic capers of fighting further help add the spice to things that I like in a movie. Not to mention, Majors really is a welcome addition for me and what he has done with a villain in terms of exciting layers. And yet, the movie still has balance issues, primarily in the form of doing a consistent job of handling everything and not doing too much. I think there was a lot they try to accomplish, which they kind of did, but I just think more time or less content would have helped with character usage, action, and that full effect I like to see in other movies. Still, I don't think this is horrible, nor do I think it is perfect, but the opening gamble was enjoyable for me. My scores are:Action/Adventure/Comedy: 8.0

However, it falls short compared to its predecessors, leaving many fans disappointed.Plot
The film begins with Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) and his allies, Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) and Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), attempting to rescue Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer), who has been trapped in the quantum realm for decades. Along the way, they encounter a new villain, Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors), who threatens to destroy the multiverse. The team must work together to stop Kang and rescue Janet, while also dealing with the challenges of their own personal lives.Characters
Paul Rudd continues to deliver a charming and charismatic performance as Scott Lang, showcasing his growth as a superhero. Evangeline Lilly shines as Hope Van Dyne, bringing depth and emotion to the role. Michael Douglas is a standout as Hank Pym, bringing gravitas and wisdom to the team. Michelle Pfeiffer is a standout as Janet Van Dyne, bringing a sense of nostalgia and hope to the story. Jonathan Majors is a standout as Kang the Conqueror, bringing a sense of menace and intrigue to the story.Atmosphere and Visuals
The film has a darker and more serious atmosphere compared to its predecessors, with a focus on action and adventure. The visuals are impressive, with well-choreographed action sequences and innovative use of the quantum realm. The film's tone is more dramatic and intense, with a focus on family and team dynamics.Conclusion
""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" is a weaker entry in the ""Ant-Man"" franchise compared to the first two films. While it manages to balance humor, action, and heart, it fails to live up to the high standards set by its predecessors. The strong performances and engaging story make it a must-see for fans of the first two films, but overall, it falls short in delivering the same level of excitement and entertainment.Rating: 6/10.",1,0,drlex-15751,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur128266142/?ref_=tturv_usr_101_t,29-Oct-24,
6,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8877353/?ref_=tturv_perm_102,A decent but underwhelming experience,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is fine. It's nowhere near Marvel's best but it just about holds its own.Mostly this is because of Jonathan Majors, who is up there with Michael B Jordan's Killmonger as one of Marvel's finest antagonists. His performance is chillingly clinical and powerful. I don't think pitting him against Ant-Man is the best pairing however. The humour that goes hand in hand with Scott Lang contrasts the seriousness of Kang a little too starkly for my liking. I would have liked to have seen him up against a more serious Avenger.The rest of the performances are all good. Paul Rudd brings his charm to Scott Lang as ever. Kathryn Newton is a nice addition to the Marvel family, although I do think the chemistry between the two is a little weak.Where this film really gets let down is the story. Dare I say it I got a little bored. It just feels quite simple and underwhelming. The writing isn't great which doesn't help. The humour didn't really land for me either.It does boast some enjoyable visuals, with plenty of colour and vibrancy.I can't help but feel at this point that Marvel just needs to slow down. There is just so much Marvel content being pumped out that the action sequences, story lines, even the jokes, are just becoming far too formulaic and phoned in. When these films were coming out once, maybe twice a year that was more forgivable, but with 3 or more films and several TV shows each year the Marvel formula is getting a little tiresome. As a result I can't help but feel that Ant-Man is a victim of Marvel's success, resulting in a lacklustre and ultimately forgettable yet enjoyable film.",7,7,ethanbresnett,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur114450253/?ref_=tturv_usr_102_t,18-Feb-23,

How Marvel introduces their next main villain who struggles beat the ants is what the movie is all about.Ant-Man films are the kind of escapist cinema within the MCU that simply delivers on harmless fun.

I've always want to like Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania more than Ant-Man And The Wasp, and definitely not wanted to like it less than the first Ant-Man, and it all came down in the middle, even though in a lot of ways i do like Ant-Man And The Wasp better and sometimes this one better, but all the way through i enjoyed the movie and i can even safely say now after thinking about everything that's going down, Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania is a good if not a great MCU movie in a long time for me, now, did i get the hate?, not really because i do get some of the cheesyness of it, some of the CGI for me if not all of them for everybody, and even though that was my real two problems of the film, besides that, i think the film are mostly great, in terms of the story, characters, and acting for the most part, it's a fun straight forward intense journey that takes place in this weird CGI fest world, and i enjoyed it, Jonathan Majors was great as Kang, Paul Rudd and the rest of his family was good, even Bill Murray have a very pleasant little appearance and performance in the film, but the one that absolutely deserve to be credited is Corey Stoll as MODOK, sure his CGI face wasn't that good and sometimes a bit too much but his performance is amazing and it's pretty caught me off guard, it's nice to see a good MCU movie again after two miss in a row for me (Thor: Love And Thunder and Black Panther: Wakanda Forever), and overall Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania is a pretty great opening to the new Phase of the MCU.",91,142,HabibieHakim123,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur105506099/?ref_=tturv_usr_105_t,17-Feb-23,

The film introduces Kang to us, who I assume is going to be the next big bad, just like Thanos. It's setting up our villain. Not a bad thing at all, but it took away from Ant-man. It felt like this wasn't really his movie, he was just there and so was everyone else. The story felt very rushed. It was all action and very little story telling. They tried to make into this ""big thing"" from Janet's past that she never wanted to talk about. But it was poorly executed and came off almost boring, it had too much foretelling.I loved the Quantum realm itself. The film did a great job showing it and the creatures. But I think it could have dived more into showing the realm and the stories of the creatures. Instead it focused on other things it really didn't need to.

But that isn't enough to make for a good movie.It would have been nice if there had been a solid and understandable story. It may be my too simple brain, but I didn't grasp anything of the premise (the whole Lang-family being sucked into a sub-atomic ""quantum""-universe by some device that teen-daughter Cassie had concocted), or of the subsequent goings-on (thousands of creatures living in the sub-atomic world, as well as a complete city - I mean, doesn't the material that all those people and things were made of consists of atoms too? Atoms within atoms?!?). Of course everyone tried his best to make things believable by all kinds of quasi scientific (meant-to-be) explanations, but I didn't hear a thing that even made slightly sense!As said, visually it's all breathtaking, and the acting is over-all fine enough. But I missed the humor of the first movies, and Ant-Man Scott himself seemed only a supporting character among his all-heroic family-members.

Probably another victim of MCU's mandatory 2 hour runtime stipulation. I'm not against the idea, but without a solid script and a creative direction there's nothing else to do that can make a movie entertaining that long. I understand the negative reaction to this movie, even though I liked it. All I can say is that this one is miles better than the trainwreck called, Thor: Love and Thunder.I like Kathryn Newton but I agree her performance was sort of lackadaisical in this movie. In my opinion she delivered a satisfying performance. But I can't say the same about Paul Rudd, his performance was kinda sloppy most of the time. I think the age is catching up to him.

Second one was really good with an amazing villain. This was my main initial issue with this movie at first. Marvel had maybe their best female villain ever in Ant-Man 2. She was spectacular all the way and delivered a spotless performance. How often do we get a truly great female villain? The bad guy in this one was quite transparent as it's a film for kids so right away I knew who the bad guy was and was let down. They went away from what made Ant-Man 2 so great. She carried the movie on her shoulders. And this one is a more typical and predictable storyline.But this one is actually not bad at all. They of course are now exploring multiuniverses as the main Earth is too overprotected with way too many strong heroes. So most new Marvel movies are set in some alternative universe and often this fails horribly as we don't get to follow known characters in their own world. But I actually like what they did here as all the jokes land and we get to explore a new Star Wars like world. I was very, very surpriced about how well the humor worked. Thor 4 showed how awful these Marvel movies can turn out if they overdo the humor and think they are funny. It was horrible. Unfunny and didn't take itself seriously so I didn't either. Ant-Man 3 has natural jokes that are not overdone and all land as they are subdued. Often just small quirps not gigantic CGI gags. The CGI meanwhile is used for serious action.I do feel like the movie is a bit too frantic. We meet too many new characters and the universe is never fully explored. Many side characters only get a few scenes. And as the daughter is now also a superhero as seen on the poster we get way too many superpowers. This is why Michael Douglas was so nice here. Just the normal smart guy in a crazy world. The daughter should have had this role. Just make her a normal young girl kicking butt when needed by being brave instead of making her part of the crew. It would make this universe more magical as we could see it through the eyes or a regular girl from a regular world. Instead the movie becomes too busy. But frankly it's never dull and so many things make so much sense. All plot elements and characters are perfectly put together in a coherent mess. And once the bad guy is defeated it finally dawns on me how this all works out. The movie is so clever if you just think about the smaller elements and how the time travel works. Frankly Marvel is not dead at all. I know they have made a ton of horrible stuff after Avengers: Infinity War (2018), but there are still decent Marvel movies being made if you just look for them. The Spider-Man series for example is still going fairly strong. It's not the old Marvel with top quality everywhere. But there is still some fun to be found in this franchise. In 2021 and 2022 we got 7 Marvel movies. 4 were absolutely ghastly. But now in 2023 we start out very strong so hopefully the last 2 years can be washed away.",1,7,JurijFedorov,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur4032055/?ref_=tturv_usr_117_t,29-Apr-23,

It's sad that her part in this film is so miniscule, which doesn't help it's case.Not entirely sure if this is a better sequel than ""the Wasp"", as the strange pacing at the beginning and a lack of action and cool set-pieces not only hurts repeatability, but even the first watch. The story is also very linear and simplistic, with plenty of dull and flat moments, while exuding ""wanting to be more"" but doesn't get there. There are no layers or payoffs, and I wish we could do without many of the tropes it uses (as they feel tiring by now).

Which isn't a good look to what is going to be the threat moving forward.And on the back of my head, I kept thinking : When the entire multiverse spits out whole branching universes when someone decides to do something (see Loki's series), actions start to seem pointless. And the appeal of our versions of the Avengers (now that the ""good ones"" are gone) starts to diminish..

7,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8877495/?ref_=tturv_perm_120,You Can Call It a Trilogy,"So, I'm not going to say this is a great Marvel film. However, I also won't say it is a bad movie either. There are a lot of good things in this film, but it also has things going on within it, that could have been done better. It definitely is one of those filler-movies, Marvel has to release, every now-and-then, in order to tie things together, for the bigger MCU franchise's main plot-arc. The MCU has a problem due to this, but that problem is born from many good positives, found in the MCU's past. This problem doesn't apply to the fans, but does effect the more general audience. Marvel still needs to get to that point, when they can dazzle the audience again, with a huge block-buster, cross-over event, like Avengers: End Game (2019). In the meantime, they want to take their time and create a build-up to that next huge event. The fans are okay with that, but the general audience might not be.In the case of Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), it makes sense, that the third film in the trilogy, should center around the quantum realm. It is part of the Ant-Man mythos found in the comic books, plus it plays a huge role in the main MCU story. We leave the setting of San Francisco, where the first two films took place and go to a completely different setting for this film. It's a quick arrival to the quantum realm too. Director, Peyton Reed gets right into it, as the plot takes us into the quantum realm, within the first 15 minutes of the film. This is where some of the problems develop in the beginning of the film. Director Reed has so much territory he needs to cover in this film, that those plot-points, took away time needed, to revisit the main characters. The Wasp was totally overlooked in this film. Other supporting characters suffer too. The beginning of the film is so quick, it looks sloppily forced at us, in order to get into the quantum realm.The positive side to this approach is, it creates a whole new different Ant-Man film. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023), contains a side to his character, that we don't get to see a lot. Rudd was tapped to bring in a comedic-side to the role, much like Michael Keaton was for Batman (1989). Both of these actors were able to sell their characters, as serious, emotional, superhero fodder, but also added that comedy splash into the design of the characters. These are great performances by both actors. It was very evident with Rudd in the first two Ant-Man films. This time however, Peyton Reed decides to tap more into the tough, brave, hero-side of Ant-Man, seen in Avengers: End Game (2019), by showing us a more mature, emotional, serious, successful, liberated Scott Lang. All of his head-aches from the past were gone, however the five year gap he lost with his daughter, Cassie (Kathryn Newton), weighs in on his mind.With the comedy-side of Scott Lang subdued, some of the comedy is dished-out to Michael Douglas' Hank Pym in this film. Both of the parents of Hope Van Dyne, the Wasp (Evangeline Lilly), play a big role in this film. It was their depictions of Hank and Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer), that are stand-outs. Janet is tough and Hank is still cool. They are the original Ant-Man and the Wasp in this film. There are some new characters, that I thought were pretty good, like Veb (voice of David Dastmalchian), a slime creature, obsessed with holes, Quaz (William Jackson Harper), who can read minds and this cool, robot-creature, who's whole head is an energy-blaster. Can't find his name. He had no speaking parts. However, some of the new characters seemed slightly dull. What does pay-off well is the performance of Jonathan Majors as Kang, the Conqueror. His part in the film, is explained well, so the general audience should be satisfied and the fans should see some of the answers they have been looking for, since the end of season one of Loki (2021). This is a film, that is just going-through-the-motions, for the bigger picture and can be dull to some at certain moments. However, it does effectively end Payton Reed's trilogy. I'm sure, eventually, as time goes by, this film will slip down to the lower levels of MCU rankings, but for now, it sets up many interesting scenarios and new questions of things to come.6.6 (C- MyGrade) = 7 IMDB.",12,9,PCC0921,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur109135693/?ref_=tturv_usr_120_t,18-Feb-23,

It is a very ""Comic Bookie"" film in that it takes the audience to the ""Quantum Realm"" and all the quirky characters and locations therein.Director Peyton Reed (who helmed the previous 2 Ant-Man films) leans into this ""Comic Bookieness"" in that he accents the weird and bizarre and creates comic-book-like panels on the images on the screen. Consequently, this makes the film interesting to look at, but for the most part, there is not much substance under the surface.For their part, Ruud, Lilly, Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer (returning from the 2nd Ant-Man film) and newcomer Kathryn Newton (taking over the role of Ruud's daughter, Cassie) are game in what they are asked to work with and react to (mostly to a green screen with CGI filled in later) and they all are winning (enough) presences on screen to spend a very enjoyable time with.Jonathan Majors is on-board as Kang the Conqueror (a version of him was seen at the end of the first season of the Disney+ series LOKI) and he brings his considerable acting chops, gravitas and weight to the proceedings. He is a force to be reckoned with which was apparent from almost the first time he commanded the screen in this film. It will be interesting to see where he takes things from here.The problem with this film is that it is (mostly) style with very little substance. Necessarily, the plot drives a more dramatic, darker theme to this Ant-Man film than in previous outings and the film suffers because of it. One of the charms of the Ant-Man films is that Director Reed was able to lean into the inherent goofiness of Paul Ruud and the absurd idea of him being able to shrink. That quirkiness and sense of fun is gone - as are regular characters played in the past 2 films by the likes of Bobby Canavale, Judy Greer, Randall Park (who has a blink or you'll miss him cameo) and (most egregiously) Michael Pena.What they are replaced by are some quirky ""Quantum Realm"" characters - most of whom are CGI and are voiced by some very good voice performers - it just doesn't hit the same, since the overall theme is darker. Katy M. O'Brian and William Jackson Harper (who is rounding into a very intriguing performer) bring gusto to their roles as a few members of the Quantum realm, which helps pick up the sagginess of this film, but not enough. Not even a Bill Murray appearance can elevate this film to something funner than it is.All in all a ""fine"" entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe - and one that will remind you very much that you are watching a film based on Comic Book characters - but it falls squarely in the middle of the MCU entries...a catalogue of which is becoming very deep (maybe too deep), indeed.Letter Grade: B7 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",9,7,bankofmarquis,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur10919398/?ref_=tturv_usr_124_t,18-Mar-23,
4,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8878679/?ref_=tturv_perm_125,The First MCU Film I Have Ever Disliked,"I am a massive fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (also known as the MCU), which is why writing this review is about to sting. Going back to the beginning of the franchise over a decade ago with Iron Man, Thor, The Incredible Hulk, Captain America: The First Avenger, and their culmination in The Avengers, it all felt special. Yes, after that there were a few stumbles with Thor: The Dark World (which I still mildly enjoy) and Iron Man 2 (which I think gets a worse rap than it deserves), but I've always at the very least thought their projects were anywhere from fine to fantastic. Well, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania has now hit theatres and after 41 projects, this is the first one I have straight-up disliked. This film is troublesome for the franchise, and here's why.The story picks up after the events of Avengers: Endgame. Scott Lang's daughter Cassie has been studying science and the Quantum Realm when Scott was trapped for five years. Her curiosities send the two of them, Hope Van Dyne, Hank Pym and Janet Van Dyne back into the Quantum Realm together, which leads them to discover that there are entire civilizations living down there. Meeting many new faces and learning that Janet knows of a man named Kang that cannot be released, leads to his big introduction as the new big Marvel villain.This film is basically an introduction to make you buy into this new character of Kang (who was also briefly introduced in the Loki series on Disney+) and I absolutely did. I think Jonathan Majors is absolutely amazing in this role and I can't wait to see all of his future appearances. So why did I dislike it then? Let's dive in.The scenes involving Kang are great, some of the good humour from the past Ant-Man films is also present, and the cast all work very well together as always. With all of that said though, this film is a series of spectacle moments and CGI action sequences, mostly involving characters that the film did not even take the time to make me care about. Everything about the events of this film (excluding Kang) seems inconsequential to the MCU as a whole, or even to the Ant-Man films. It doesn't really feel like an Ant-Man movie, but rather a long side mission that felt plucked out of an Avengers movie. To me, it just did not work.On top of everything, you can visually see that Marvel has been struggling with quantity over quality because there are many moments where I felt like I was watching something budgeted for television. If I first saw this film on Disney+ it would've made much more sense. I hate bagging on movies, especially in a franchise I love so much, but when a film is meant to set up the next huge villain and you want people to flock out and witness that, it just does not seem like enough time or care was put into this story, or even visually (but I also understand the circumstances of Visual Effects artists currently being overworked in the industry too). For something that is supposed to be the start of something much bigger, it is quite a mess in my opinion.In the end, the biggest issue going forward is that people who watch the next Avengers movie may not be able to fully grasp who Kang is and what he can do if they do not watch some of the other films he has appeared in. This has never been an issue with the MCU before. Thanos was teased but never a core character in anything before Avengers: Infinity War. I love this franchise (I will say that a million more times too) and I cannot wait for the next film to be released, but I really hope this studio can figure out a way of making the next event movie accessible to average moviegoers, otherwise, I think they are about to start losing a lot of their audience. Again, this is only the first film I have even remotely disliked after about 41 projects, so obviously, I am still completely on board with everything, but for such a pivotal moment in this franchise, colour me a little worried.

3,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9069768/?ref_=tturv_perm_126,A Lot of Little Things,"The movie has a lot of little problems. Problems that, on their own wouldn't be all that distracting. In a better put together film, most could write them off as ""nitpicks"". But when the story and characters are not engaging enough, these little problems really add up, and the movie suffers death by 1000 cuts.The ""Quantum Realm"" is not that visually interesting. It looks like all the actors filmed their scenes separately on a green screen. The realm itself is just a series of browns and oranges like an old dusty screw. You don't get any sense of size in this movie. When Ant-Man is in the real world he will interact with objects we are familiar with. We know he is big because he is compared to a boat or an airplane. In the Quantum Realm there is no scaling. There is a scene where two characters are supposedly giant, but since they are just the same size as each other, they look like normal people.Back when Janet was in the Quantum Realm, she helped out Jonathan Majors fix his ship. But then she discovered that he was evil. How did she discover this? For some reason his spaceship is fueled by his mind...so Janet touching the ship made it so she could read his mind. Not very well explained and it doesn't make much sense. Feels like the writers were hoping to come up with an explanation later but just never did. They needed her to find out he was evil, so she just found out, end of story. A big plot point surrounds the idea that Janet doesn't want to tell any of her family about this interaction. Why? The movie tries to imply that she feels guilty or traumatized about it. But I don't buy it, it is just so drama can happen between Hope and Janet, otherwise Hope has nothing to do in this movie.MODOK is terrifying for all the wrong reasons. Every time he is on screen, I am immediately wanting him to leave. His character arc also makes no sense.Speaking of things that make no sense, Jonathan Majors' powerset fluctuates wildly depending on what the plot demands. It seems like he should win easily, but then when the third act approaches, suddenly he makes a lot of stupid decisions and is capable of killing everyone except for the main characters.Cassie is super annoying. She is a self-righteous, entitled know it all that keeps getting vindicated.I liked Jonathan Majors in the movie. And unlike other Marvel movies, I actually was fine with the comedy in this movie. It was an appropriate level of humor for this character. I enjoyed that the movie does not waste much time in getting the story going. The story begins and ends with a good pace.Overall, the rules of their world don't add up. Characters seem to change with no believable motivation. Some characters are just annoying. The visuals are unappealing. So yes, a lot of these could have been forgiven but it is all the small things the movie does wrong. Of all people, Ant-Man should know the power of small things.",6,5,JayWolfgramm,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur40795830/?ref_=tturv_usr_126_t,21-May-23,

The second half picked up the pace though and made it half-enjoyable.I'm not a Paul Rudd fan and not a Ben Affleck one too. I think both these dudes look the same. It was good to see Michelle Pfeiffer again(Batman Returns, Into The Night). My favorite actor Bill Murray(Ghostbusters, Groundhog day) has aged badly though. Michael Douglas(Black Rain, Jewel Of The Nile, The Star Chamber, The War Of The Roses, The Ghost And The Darkness, Falling Down) still looks good. It was great to see all these legends together one last time.Okay about the movie. The special-effects are saturated with CGI same like the Shazam sequel. The story deals with Janet van Dyne(Pym's wife) being trapped in the Quantum realm. The rest of the plot deals with a device that can make entry into the Quantum realm and thereby rescue Janet.Verdict: just about enjoyable for a one-time viewing.

3,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8884293/?ref_=tturv_perm_128,On & on & on & on & on...,"In the same way that ""X Men: Apocalypse"" was a thoroughly underwhelming viewing experience after the events of ""Days of Future Past"" (& a signal of the 20th Century Fox Universe's impending collapse), sitting through ""Quantumania"" at the cinema feels very reminiscent of that fateful feature; a total slog, arguably akin to watching a corporate, money hungry studio thrust the lifeless corpse of a dead franchise (which died of natural causes in 2019) in front of paying audiences; held up loosely at the limbs by strings, hoping that the visible movement in the ligaments will perhaps convince viewers that this decomposing husk is arguably still alive & therefore, they should continue to attend future screenings (& grace Disney with their hard earned cash) - under the pretence the heart's seemingly beating.Dear reader, it is not.If the third ""Antman"" proves anything beyond reasonable doubt (accounting for the fact that the movie spends the majority of its run-time, endeavouring to justify its existence without providing an actual explanation), it's that the story irrevocably concluded with (the aptly titled) ""Avengers: Endgame"" & anyone still entertaining the possibility of revivication will be brutally disabused of that fantasy by the time the credits start rolling.I say this because one of the most essential things a writer can do (to ensure a high quality of work when crafting even the most basic of story) is know when to stop (before their tales out-stay their welcome) - to guarantee that our investments of time are worthwhile - & here marks the point where I truly believe the MCU crosses that unavoidable threshold & ventures perilously close to undoing all that's been done, previously - in an undignified attempt to remain relevant. Of course, the boundaries for such a parameter are subjective (& our idea of what constitutes a ""dragged-out"" denouement differs) so others are entitled to an opposing viewpoint but in my opinion, when a continuation necessitates the negation of a prior plot thread's emotional stakes to justify further installments, that's typically an indicator of when you've gone too far (because you're doing genuine damage to what came before & informing the audience that the purpose of the progression isn't to develop & grow for any discernible reason - whilst maintaining the importance of the past - but to needlessly expand for the sheer sake of it, at any cost, providing them with a reason to no longer engage) & resultantly, that's when no further sequels should be granted (as it's clearly over)... However, in order to establish ""Kang the Conqueror"" as a new credible threat, the saga subsequently falls in to that fatal trap (acting as an embarrassing statement of intent - ""I'm not going anywhere"" - really, loitering like an attendee at a house party who doesn't seem to realise it's over) & trivialises the risks posed beforehand. Consequently, Peyton Reed & his scribe Jeff Loveness (in the space of a mere 2 hours) render over a decade's worth of carefully planned, built-up world-building as meaningless - to inorganically shift the emphasis on to *this* antagonist (whose jarringly immediate introduction gives the impression as though an ""Avengers"" level threat was required quickly to maintain fan attention & having already dealt with Thanos - an iconic villain whose foreboding presence was felt for years before naturally emerging - executives alternatively approached them to desperately pitch the insertion of ""bad guy 2"" within the space of 1 blockbuster) who - at this rate - will (additionally) likely be equally inconsequential within a few years... So what's the point? The only honest response is ""profit"" & ""capitalist greed"". That's what this is; more of the same, repackaged unadventurously, yet brazen in its increasingly superficial motivations.The palpable aura of irrelevance is exacerbated further by the sci-fi concept featured; despite the consistent lack of originality in their product, Marvel's outings used to at least have relative structure / coherence & follow a linear format. Now tackling the multi-verse (with endless possibilities, variations of the same characters existing simultaneously in endless realities & universes housed within each other), since literally ANYTHING is possible (rules be damned), the insignificance of what we're watching feels more noticeable than ever considering that feeling (of futility) is ironically shared by the people we see on screen (no longer adhering to any sense of logic). Furthermore, if one universe is destroyed, an infinity of others are not... Again, Jonathan Major's ""Kang"" (who has apparently culled numerous timelines) embodies a hollow risk that's insisted to be monumental - yet we know it's ironically infinitesimal, due the brazen replaceability of everything. As mentioned, that culminates as a tired reaffirmation of the triviality of what we're witnessing (irrespective of its visual spectacle) so rather than carving out a clear, distinct direction... People will leave theatres, reminded how it doesn't have one anymore - yet stuff repeatedly happens, in spite of that - through obligation, not requirement.I haven't even mentioned the humiliatingly shoddy VFX (so soon after James Cameron's ""Avatar"", which is a masterpiece by comparison), awfully expository dialogue, juvenile humour (so many jokes about holes / bodily functions) & convoluted nature of the messy, contrived script. Plus, the half-baked, two-dimensional characterisations, unconvincing line deliveries & surprisingly uninventive cinematography (from Bill Pope, responsible for ""The Matrix"" trilogy). None of it works. None of it will end by its own volition. You'll have to prize that sore, milked udder from their dry, mummified hands. They're squeezing out every last drop & we'll be forced to endure each & every torturous moment until someone finally puts this out of its misery.",4,9,W011y4m5,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur71088443/?ref_=tturv_usr_128_t,21-Feb-23,
4,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8883119/?ref_=tturv_perm_129,The Return of Mr. Electric,"The opening of this film is fantastic. I found myself laughing seconds after the MARVEL title rolled. Paul Rudd's performance as Scott Lang never feels like an act, as he naturally fits the role. His character is charming as ever in his 5th movie as Ant-Man.Marvel is known for extensive world-building and interconnected stories. Since 2021's ""Loki"", it has been known that Kang the Conqueror is the next Thanos-level villain in the MCU. This film gives us a deeper look at Kang, and the casting for his character (Jonathan Majors) is excellent.By leaving the regular world and diving into the world beneath (the Quantum Realm), the film relies heavily on green screens and computer-generated imagery (CGI). These graphics and effects are some of the poorest of the franchise, with a character called MODOK being the worst. There were times that the film was reminiscent of 2005's ""The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl"".Other than the CGI, the biggest weakness in this film is the screenplay. From rushed plot points to painful dialogue, it is evident that the screenwriter had never written something of this magnitude. In the emotional and climactic moments, the script is so bad that it distracts from the story, with the audience in my theater audibly laughing.""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" is a small piece in the larger Marvel storyline. This is felt throughout the film, as the convoluted Quantum Realm and endless timelines are explored. The first two Ant-Man movies succeeded in simplicity, but this sequel was anything but simple. In short, the character of Scott Lang is better as the friendly, neighborhood Ant-Man.Best Character: Kang

Sure, it's nothing like the first two, but that makes it a fascinating watch! The Quantum Realm is full of inspiration and wild looking creatures. This movie has a ton of fun with its surroundings and just seems far more free than the constraints of most superhero movies. The cast looks like they are having just as much fun with it as well. The hardest laughs belong to MODOK, who is deliberately designed to look ridiculous. It wasn't a mistake, it's the whole point. MODOK is one of the best things about this movie, especially because you can't take him seriously. Perhaps the tonal shifts were too stark and that's what isn't sitting well with Marvel fans. I would agree and additionally, I think that is a reoccurring problem in Marvel movies.

Scott's daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton) emulates her father's criminal activities, but also investigates the Quantum Realm. When she accidentally opens a portal, she is sucked into the Quantum Realm along with her father, his girlfriend Hope (Evangeline Lilly), and her grandparents Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Hank (Michael Douglas).To get back home, they follow Janet's advice, after being trapped here for years. In the Quantum Realm, they encounter many different creatures, some of which are hostile. Scott meets the mysterious Kang (Jonathan Majors), who promises to help him get back home, but whether he can trust Kang remains the question.With this film, the Marvel series begins their fifth phase. Unfortunately, this leaves little room to create your own story. This film almost largely only serves as preparations for future films in the Marvel series. Many things and new characters seem to be of little importance. The story of this film can therefore seem a bit messy and is sometimes difficult to follow.It is a special task for Peyton Reed, because he can start the first film of the fifth phase. Furthermore, he will have the chance to introduce important things for this stage in the Marvel series. For this film they also made more use of LED technology. This technique is increasingly used in the film world to replace green or blue screen technologies and provide more realistic backgrounds in the front of the film. This new filmmaking technique became popular with its use in the Star Wars TV series The Mandalorian. Peyton Reed has directed two episodes of this show.He takes these techniques, atmosphere and images to his third Ant-Man film, so that the film sometimes comes across as a cheaper Star Wars film. These effects work even better on the small screen of TVs than on the big screen of cinemas. This may also be due to the qualities and talents of the director. In this film, during some scenes you can see that the background is fake. This can also be seen with some CGI characters. For the character MODOK she tried to combine CGI and motion capture, but ended up with a separate and unbelievable character. This character is so hard to take seriously and is reminiscent of older movies from the 90's where she first introduced CGI to the movie world.The acting is done well by most of the film cast, but due to the amount of different characters and the messy story, everyone doesn't get the same amount of time to make something special out of their roles. Paul Rudd knows how to provide suitable comedy moments. Fortunately, the comedy is not too strong either. Michelle Pfeiffer gets more opportunities to come forward in this Marvel film. She even has some action moments, which are reminiscent of her from Catwoman. Michael Douglas gets a little less playing time, but does have some sarcastic comedy. Besides the fact that Evangeline Lilly can finally wear a superhero costume, she unfortunately doesn't get much else to do.Kathryn Newton replaces Emma Fuhrmann in the role of Cassie Lang. Although Emma has only played the role for a short time, seeing a new face to the character can take some getting used to. Kathryn Newton fortunately plays the role well in her own and energetic way. Jonathan Majors is also returning to the Marvel series, only now playing a variant of Kang, a similar character he previously played in the Marvel TV series Loki. Here he gets the chance to portray his character in other ways that also respond more to Marvel's future film plans.",0,2,movieman6-413-929510,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur34790048/?ref_=tturv_usr_134_t,16-Feb-23,

The problem is that around this decent movie is a layer of nonsense, a lot of propaganda and a basic premiss which is beyond contempt.Worst for me though is the 25yo daughter (how did she get that old?) and the actress in question. Horribly written Mary Sue character that very few will like.I cannot even tell you how badly done this movie is. Marvel has really dropped it.

Since this movie came out, I've seen two really excellent Marvel properties: Guardians of the Galaxy 3 and Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse. I would've expected to absolutely hate this movie, as a result. Along with that, I've never really *loved* the Ant-Man films; they always represented the blandest, least interesting version of the MCU to me.So colour me surprised that...I didn't hate Quantumania. Let's get the bad out of the way: the effects are quite spotty, the environments very ugly, 3/5 of the main characters don't have much of a point to be in the movie, Kathryn Newton was objectively terrible in this movie, MODOK was a bit of a waste (and yes, he looked bad). The film's over-relies on CG and as a result, it FEELS like a static movie.All of that is valid. But for some reason (maybe I was in good spirits just seeing Across the Spider-Verse)...I actually enjoyed myself. There's a lot of good in this movie too: I thought the homage to 50s B-movies were really fun, the music was surprisingly excellent, the film played with some weird and interesting concepts (like the probability explosion) that led to some great set pieces. Kang (Jonathan Majors...for now, by this time everyone is aware of his legal issues) was a pretty compelling villain, although I don't think they did a particularly great job at explaining his motivations. His performance really saved the day.Paul Rudd is still pretty great as Ant-Man. Yes, he's basically playing himself, but it's fine. I don't know, this movie kept me engaged for most of it and maybe that's because I don't expect these movies to be groundbreaking time and time again. To me, it gave more interesting stuff that giant pez dispensers or Tonka trucks. I'm genuinely fine with the lack of Michael Peña and Bill Murray's weird cameo was one the best parts of the movie to me.Honestly, I think MCU fans and haters alike need to calm down. This was fine.

The premise of the film sees Ant-Man, The Wasp & their family sent into The Quantum Realm, where they come face to face with Kang The Conqueror.Main Character
Paul Rudd is back as Scott Lang and I think once again he does a great job. He has plenty to do this time and his character has truly progressed since his first film. He is more confident as an Avenger and this shows in how he acts. His character has a clear progression and it is great to see Rudd deliver this really fun performance. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for The Wasp played by Evangeline Lily. The only reason I am putting her as a main character is because her name is in the title but she is given nothing to do in the film. Lily has shown that she can give development to Hope Van Dyne but she is really pushed to the side for other characters as that is a shame.Supporting Characters
The real star of the film for me though was Jonathan Majors as Kang The Conqueror, Majors knocks it out of the park and provides a chilling and charismatic performance as this new antagonist. He has huge shoes to fill from Thanos and I was worried he would be saved for his future appearances but he is in this film a lot and he is given a chance to thrive and give a glimpse of what could be to come. Michael Pfeiffer plays Janet Van Dyne and she is given so much screen time here, we learn more about her time in the Quantum Realm and Pfeiffer does a great job in fleshing out this character that we have barely seen on screen. Kathryn Newton is the recast for Cassie Lang and she is a fun character here, the dynamic between her and Rudd is well realised and she is given plenty to do here which I mostly like. Michael Douglas is back as Hank Pym and despite having less to do, he is still enjoyable and still seems to have his passion for the character and the role.Story
The story was okay, my favourite parts were learning more about the backstory of Kang and what exactly Janet was up to during her time in The Quantum Realm. It was nice seeing some progression and development in Ant-Man from his actions in Endgame. But as I mentioned before, the film completely underuses Wasp and as a major character that is a big shame. Also, the final act makes some decisions that I am not sure works for what the audience are told in the film with way too much taking place.Script
The script was good. With it being an Ant-Man film there was plenty of humour here and the majority worked for me. It also had good drama and for the most part the two tones are separate and work well together.Style
The film is mostly set in The Quantum Realm and that means there is plenty of CGI here and for the most part it looks great. The visuals are very striking and colourful which makes it interesting and dynamic. The film is also paced pretty well, with the runtime feeling appropriate. But I felt like the action scenes could have been filmed better, there was a lot of shaky cam going on especially early on that made it hard to focus.Overall
Overall, Ant-Man and The Wasp is a good film that does an effective job of delivering an interesting film that sets up the future of The MCU. It probably fits in the middle in terms of quality of Ant-Man films but if you enjoy these films then it is worth a watch.Rating - 7/10.",5,4,alindsayal,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur147091341/?ref_=tturv_usr_140_t,19-Feb-23,

The president of Marvel Studios announced that this movie will be a ""direct line"" into Phase 5, leading into Avengers: The Kang Dynasty in 2025.Scott Lang and Hope van Dyne, along with Hope's parents and Scott's daughter, are accidentally sent to the Quantum Realm. They find themselves interacting with all kinds of strange, new creatures that threaten their lives and understanding.The movie was directed by Peyton Reed. Jack Kirby wrote the story with Jeff Loveness working on the screenplay.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
People and characters in danger
Talk of infidelity and their ""needs""
Some profanity and crude languageTHINGS I LIKED:
The cast includes our faves from the last two movies, as well as a few new faces: Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly, Michelle Pfeiffer, Michael Douglas, Bill Murray, Kathryn Newton, William Jackson Harper, David Dastmalchian, and the wonderful Jonathan Majors.Keep watching during the closing credits for another scene that leads perfectly into Season 2 of Loki.It kind of feels like this movie was developed at the same time Disney was working on Strange World.There are so many creative, new characters, some good and some bad.The world-building is inventive and interesting.It cracked me up when Dr. Hank Pym used his handy-dandy enlarger to get a large pizza when he only paid for a small one. Ha ha
If you can never get enough of the Star Wars cantina scenes, you'll get a kick out of what's offered here.Fun fact #1: The movie was filmed in Georgia (USA), London (England), and Turkey.Lots of action sequences.Kang the Conquerer is a fascinating character that we'll get to learn more about in future MCU films. Jonathan Majors does an excellent job introducing us to this powerful foe.Audiences are loving the exploration of the multiverse that Marvel is taking us into.There are some amusing running gags that kept me entertained.I used to love Baskin Robbins when I was a little girl. Ha ha The reference and Scott-employee cameo were cute.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
As much as I like Evangeline Lilly (and I do!), I didn't like her with short hair.Kathryn Newton replaced the younger Cassie Lang. She does a fine job but her self-righteous teenage attitude is annoying.Some viewers are complaining that the plot is too thin and just feels like a set-up for future Marvel films.",2,5,trinaboice,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur52993466/?ref_=tturv_usr_143_t,27-Oct-23,
6,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8884277/?ref_=tturv_perm_144,My fault for expecting more?,"So much happened before so unless you just binged every mcu movie before this, I suggest watching a recap video. The one by screencrush was the best one I found. This is unfortunately a pivotal movie in the mcu, so despite everything I'm going to say you still have to watch this.The one thing I loved and think they did splendidly was the story. I think it was great and the most redeeming thing about the movie, there weren't any mind blowing twists but it kept me interested throughout, didn't feel like lazy writing.Kang delivered, character wise, but I feel like apart from the visions from the future he was underwhelming. He's supposedly a multiversal threat, killed so many avengers in different timelines, the big bad conqueror... and he's outdone by antman?(and not through wits, that'd been more believable). It took time to actually see his power because when the fighting starts he seems to be cautious and sorta aghast he's going to lose. Maybe I don't rate antman highly enough, but I feel like Kang should've easily whooped his butt and maybe even killed the entire 'ant squad'.However out of all the characters, Kang's the one that carried the whole movie; Jonathan Majors did his character justice but unfortunately the writers did not. Majors delivered on top his performance in Loki which had made excited to see him again.Dialogue wasn't great, it was pretty dull and the acting was subpar, like they were shooting a Disney channel kids show at times like Cassie's continuously smiling throughout for instance. It didn't try to push for humor as much as other marvel products but the few jokes it had didn't land.Could've paced just a little quicker to make everything feel more urgent and imminent. It was inconsistent, at times I liked it, at times I was trying not to zone out.Story was amazing but the movie was missing that wow factor to make it feel special. I think Kang was arguably it but felt like he only lost so that the Kang variants come through. For the sake of keeping the story going. Also the other Kang variants were all African, thought that was funny.Modok felt like he was written to be the butt of the joke for the movie, felt very underutilized, he was sorta hyped up as this killing machine but didn't deliver. Isn't he supposed to be to Kang what steppenwolf is to darkseid. Plus he looked so silly, I mean it's hard not to make a floating head with tiny arms look silly, but they probably could've made him a lot more ghoulish to offset that.The chemistry between the characters wasn't there, as I said at the beginning, so much has happened before this movie in the mcu, so in that time antman has lost over 10yrs of seeing his daughter growing up already, before the movie even starts. The bond between all the characters wasn't there for any of the characters and it wasn't allowed to develop.Quantum realm itself was what disappointed me the most, I knew I was expecting too much so I lowered my expectations but still somehow got disappointed. I recently watched ""Strange World"" and this was very reminiscent of that, a children's animation.It's not intolerable watch though it's just incredibly underwhelming for what it could've been. You still have to watch it as it's important for the multiverse going forward; but you could just wait until it's released for streaming instead of going to the cinemas if you're contemplating.",0,2,AfricanBro,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur120413622/?ref_=tturv_usr_144_t,21-Feb-23,

It's not a perfect film, but it doesn't suck. The story is that Ant Man and The Wasp enter a micro-world known as the Quantum Realm and encounter a trapped universe conquerer named Kang who wants to escape and unleash his wrath on all known reality. The world building is a lot of fun, the characters are pretty cool, and in the end the action is well done. The actor who plays Kang does a good job not to overplay the role and is a pretty solid villain. (Something the Marvel cinematic universe doesn't really have a lot of is good villains.) This movie has lots of action, some memorable lines, and it's never preachy.

6,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9080394/?ref_=tturv_perm_148,Entertaining Enough,"Bringing the wise-cracking Avenger back to centre stage, Quantumania shares the spotlight with the wider Lang/Pym family, in a film that is enjoyable, if not unsuccessful in it's attempt to match the drama of all recent MCU releases. It's fun, but could also be likened to Spy-Kids.A strange tone is struck. The early stages are full of the humour from the previous two instalments, but the main plot is dove into fairly immediately and it doesn't take long for severity to ensue. Having Kang as the villain matches that, but backed up by M. O. D. O. K. Felt like a goofy combination, where a scene cannot be taken seriously with a giant floating head (with off-putting CGI) hanging around in the background. He's not necessarily a bad character, and certainly one who needed to be approached as a light-hearted sideshow, but one that doesn't suit the 'epic' consequence of the end of a civilisation/world/universe.Whilst they're all part of the same universe, and this does take place in a setting only really applicable to Ant-Man and the Wasp, Quantumania does lose a little of it's trilogy's identity. The plot may be heavily tied into the wider MCU saga, but the previous two in the trilogy still had that odd-man-out feel to it in a superhero world. This could have easily been a Guardians of the Galaxy film, complete with comically odd creatures, or any of the Avengers films where an ensemble take on an all-powerful being.That said, Rudd is still great as Lang, and the rest of the cast, far more involved in the plot, match the tone and atmosphere well. The CGI looks good for the most part, even if it is a little sad that the whole film is 90% greenscreen. I can't imagine this will be anyone's favourite film, but it's entertaining and contributes massively to the wider Marvel story.",2,1,deepfrieddodo,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur123203865/?ref_=tturv_usr_148_t,26-May-23,
2,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9607704/?ref_=tturv_perm_149,Disappointing,"Ant-Man and the Wasp Quantumania was a major disappointment to me. Why? Above all it simply lacked the fun of the first two Ant-Man movies. But besides that, Ant-Man ( like Spider-Man) works best on a ""Street Level"" instead of the realm where you found Kang ( Jonathan Majors). As for Kang, there is nothing that stood out with him. He is not all powerful like Thanos, nor do you hate him like Dr. Doom or Green Goblin/Norman Osborn. Speaking of Kang's realm, it was far too dark ( as in the photography). Now I like Black and White movies ( especially Film Noir), but not for superhero movies ( unless it is necessary like with Batman or Dr. Strange). Is there anything I liked? Yes the very opening and closing scenes with Scott Lang ( Paul Rudd). They were well done and reminded me of the earlier Ant-Man films. For those scenes I give the movie a generous grade of 2/10 stars. Overall a major disappointment.

I would have to say this was the worst movie of the three that Marvel has created. In this movie the team is accidentally transported to the Quantum Realm where they encounter strange creatures and life that exist as small as the atom. The theme of Freedom comes back around towards a group of alien type creatures that are oppressed by the evil empire led by Kang who is played by Jonathan Majors. The storyline had a Star Wars feel to it, where the empire is trying to rule the galaxy and much is the same in the quantum realm. I think it was silly and couldn't take it seriously. Bill Murray had a cameo and Kathryn Newton played the older Cassie Lang.

Cinematography is serviceable but doesn't offer any memorable visual spectacles, and the music and visuals, while competent, do little to enhance the overall experience.

As the first entry in MCU's fifth phase, the film is like an injection of sugar directly into the eyes, but everything feels inauthentic and tired.Let's be clear - 'Ant-Man' was never a core member of the Avengers and is not a crowd favorite (no offense to Paul Rudd, who is a good actor and portrays the blaséness of Scott Lang to a T). So, it's to be expected that, now on his third solo (or duo, I guess, given his pairing with Evangeline Lilly's Hope Van Dyne/Wasp) outing, things are getting stale. Maybe it's the Star Wars-ification of the franchise given some glaring similarities within the Quantum Realm (thanks, Disney). Or perhaps it's the lack of strong villains (Corey Stoll's floating head and the now-canceled Jonathan Majors as Kang do not cut it).Either way, this movie is a quantum bust.",2,0,Mike_Devine,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur5631526/?ref_=tturv_usr_155_t,11-Feb-24,

The chemistry between the cast is excellent, and the humor and heart that made the previous films so enjoyable are present in full force.The use of the Quantum Realm provides a unique and visually stunning backdrop for the film's action sequences, with the size-changing technology once again adding a new element to the fights. The film's villain, Kang the Conqueror, is a formidable foe, and Jonathan Majors delivers an impressive performance that sets the stage for his future appearances in the MCU.The film's focus on family and redemption is also present, providing an emotional element to the story that is often missing from superhero films.

6,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8882035/?ref_=tturv_perm_161,Same old burger...,"This film is light and basic, with fast-paced action sequences that are always accompanied, framed and structured under layers and layers of CGI, with Marvel-style humor, Marvel-style heroes and Marvel-style villains.The paragraph you just read has a latent ambivalence and can clearly be used for many MCU movies. It's ambivalent because it can be what a lot of people look for in a movie, but it can also be the cause of what they call ""creative fatigue"" after dozens of films under the same formula, for a genre that rarely shows anything new, just changes settings and characters.Which side am I on? Well, Quantumania entertained me, because of its action, science fiction and adventure. The villain is a good antagonist, who has a decent development compared to previous villains, has great powers, but I admit that he was defeated perhaps very easily. Are there flaws? Of course! M. O. D. O. K falls into the category of wasted villains like Task Master and the humor is pretty ineffective. Although I don't hate this type of content, I don't think it's the great wonder either. It's your average superhero movie, which you'll like more or less depending on your mood.Now, let's face the fact that this is MARVEL-level cinema. It's not a high standard, never has been. We just have another product of the great machinery headed by Feige. The purpose has always been to entertain mostly teens and young adults. If we see Quantumania through that prism, it seems to me that the film fulfills its mission. It's a warm bath in the waters of CGI, which even tries to reach older generations by incorporating clear references to legendary sagas like Star Wars, but in a much more psychedelic way like the recent Strange World or as someone said out there, in the style of Moebius, although perhaps we are exaggerating a bit with this last statement. Now, if we're going from this movie alone to say that Marvel is fatigued, I don't believe it. Let's leave that excuse to She-Hulk and Ms. Marvel.This is just the same old burger pulled from the same food chain started in 2008 with Iron Man.",0,3,Movie_Rating_n_Ranking,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur44965663/?ref_=tturv_usr_161_t,20-Feb-23,

Scott after saving the world seems to be getting back to his life with Thanos. Wrote a book, was treated like a hero by the public and still trying to make up lost time with his Daughter. The whole family are shown Cassie and Hank have been working on a project involving the Quantum realm and receive signal, but after a mishap, they all get sucked into the realm and have to now find a way home while also dealing with an interdimensional tyrant Kang the Conqueror. Quantumania in many ways is more the typical Marvel Formula with poor visual effects and unwarranted humor. Overall It's more of a film that's only purpose is to set up further events as opposed to having a fun self-contained story. In the long run, it serves no purpose outside of introducing moviegoers to Kang. The first 35 minutes of the film are almost pointless showing Scott, hope, and all of them and showing that Scott has a separation between himself and Cassie, but it doesn't set up much in terms of development. As soon as they hit the Quantum Realm that is thrown away in favor of just showing off the realm. Honestly, it is not all that interesting. As opposed to Doctor Strange's. This is CGI Splattered all over the Screen that is devoid of much in terms of life. You have no idea how this world works. You micro people living here some that look human others that look like blobs and all amounts strange designs. There's a rebel group, not a single thing you will know about them. Yet you suppose to care about them being free from Kang. The World's forgettable as for the main cast most of them are boring and outraged. A huge issue with Ant-Man and The Wasp was that Scott was reduced to an idiot while the focus was primarily going to hope. Here He kinda takes a backstage again, this time by Michelle Pfeiffer who is a talent and actress, even though it is poorly written why she doesn't tell anyone about Kang. Hope does very little in the majority of the film and Michael Douglas is just there. His big moment comes near the end and it's really stupid the explanation. As for the villains, The Highlight is Jonathan Majors as Kang When he's introduced, it's almost like you entered a different movie, and while it shows potential for this character. He also has its weak points, because given the stern serious tone he goes with it just stands out that this wasn't the right film for him to debut with all this marvel humor and just undermines him in the end. He also does suffer from the fact that they explain just the basic of who he is without going into depth. Modok is just stupid and yes he's look is a little stupid in the comics with the huge head and baby legs, but still has an opposing monster look to him. Here it's just silly and everything he does is just silly it's not even Modok they just recycle the previous villain's yellowjacket.

6,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8883191/?ref_=tturv_perm_164,Nice to Look at But Otherwise Ho-Hum,"If you're looking for a dazzling display of special effects (especially in 3-D), then this latest installment in the Marvel Universe's ""Ant-man"" franchise is for you. However, if you're looking for an absorbing story, more along the lines of ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" (2022), you'll probably want to look elsewhere, despite the superb eye candy on offer here. Though visually dazzling, director Payton Reed's latest feels like something of a placeholder entry in the ongoing string of movies in this long-running series of action-adventures. Set in a vividly colorful, fantastically landscaped universe that exists below our reality at the quantum level, this picture tells the story of an unlikely superhero (Paul Rudd) and his family of colleagues (Evangeline Lilly, Michael Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer, Kathryn Newton) who become inadvertently trapped in this strange world and desperately look for a way to get home, but they must first match wits with a dastardly, powerful villain (Jonathan Majors) who stands in their way. What ultimately transpires, however, is a story that's eminently predictable and fairly formulaic, reminiscent of many other such tales, such as ""Tron: Legacy"" (2010). Also, like many other Marvel movies, the concluding sequence is once again entirely too long (even though the overall length of this production is, thankfully, comparatively shorter than many of its protracted peer releases). To its credit, the film features fine performances by Pfeiffer and Majors, as well as a commendably lucid explanation of the rudiments of quantum physics. However, these strengths, along with its stunning visuals, aren't enough to overcome the overall narrative blandness of this offering. While ""Quantumania"" is certainly best viewed on the big screen in 3-D for maximum visual effect, this film might otherwise be considered a candidate worth waiting for its streaming debut. The kind of overkill on display in this work isn't doing the Marvel Universe any good, something that really needs to be borne in mind for the future of these releases.",4,3,brentsbulletinboard,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur156441404/?ref_=tturv_usr_164_t,20-Feb-23,

3,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8874555/?ref_=tturv_perm_166,"A tease for something spectacular that may happen later (for real this time, we promise)","When I praise the older MCU films, I may seem tough to please, as I expect these movies (which, of course, make up a larger, increasingly complicated tapestry) to function as their own thing while also making sense as Shared Universe components. Truth be told, it's arguable whether the older films were wholly satisfactory in that respect.When Captain: America The Winter Soldier came out, many praised it as a decent standalone sequel to Captain America: The First Avenger -- with some useful context supplied by adjacent media, but it raised that franchise-old question of where everyone else is right now. Then we got Civil War, which brought in a lot more characters -- sans a few whose absence makes canonical sense -- and so functioned better as an MCU chapter, but if your interest is squarely in the Cap trilogy, will you truly understand it if you watch it right after The Winter Soldier?Ever since Phase Four, it's been trickier than ever, not only due to the sheer number of characters and stories to account for. Almost everything is a tie-in to and/or tease for something else -- not necessarily within the same ""trilogy"" or ""series"". Some works do try to stay in their own corner of the MCU (at the expense of making it clear what unifying Endgame all of this is building toward), I guess for simplicity's sake, yet they keep introducing threats, McGuffins, and entities so awesomely powerful that it makes even less sense for the Avengers to not at least call a quarterly meeting about the sh-t that's been happening lately. Even a witch with the capacity to destroy every world in every universe is an ""adventure of the week"".Anyway, now we have Phase Five, starting off with Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania and with it new questions about the Marvel Multiverse and the rules of time travel and universe-hopping. And yes, you're gonna need to see Endgame before this one, lest some plot details come off as headscratchers if you, for some weird reason, only care about the Ant-Man films. (Disney+'s Loki might be of use too. Oh what, you didn't know there are shows too now?)Paul Rudd reminiscing about the time he spent with the Avengers isn't so bad (in a pre-MCU superhero film, a line like that could be an Easter Egg for devoted comic readers), but much is still lost if you jump straight from Ant-Man 2 to this. I know watching any particular solo series within the MCU is a fool's game at this point, but I can't stop thinking about how I'd much prefer if this was all one big TV series or something, preferably helmed by an organized creative team who are in agreement about the rules.Quantumania also retains the Phase Four tradition of hurriedly introducing a bunch of new heroes to set up the next Disney+ title, which will almost certainly be a whole-ass TV show because a serialized narrative is more likely to keep fans subscribed than just plopping a singular film on there. As usual (and as per the traditions of the source material), it's a new version of an old hero. Scott ""Ant-Man"" Lang's daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton, nowhere near as good as in Three Billboards) comes away from this adventure with her own size-altering suit and is effectively Scott's sidekick. The Wasp of the title (Evangeline Lilly) feels weirdly sidelined.We also get to meet Kang the Conqueror, the adversary that's supposed to tie all of these increasingly disjointed movies together. Inevitably, numerous plot/lore questions arise. (""Is this the Kang that the Variant in Loki warned of, or is there a more terrible version yet?"") All the same, Jonathan Majors steals the whole show and the menace of Kang is mostly felt (making us believe he may indeed prove to be scarier than Thanos -- though I would've preferred that Kang was first discovered by Doctor Strange or something; not someone who's always functioned as the chief ""regular bloke"" of the Avengers).His Quantum Realm empire, while ugly, is shot (and designed -- see the various microscopic lifeforms made titanic) in such a way that it actually feels both epic and minuscule at the same time; a Jules Verne-inspired lost world that's vast, yet too imperceptibly small to be explored by normal humans. I feel like Michelle Pfeiffer's character owes a better explanation for why none of this was mentioned after she escaped the Realm in the previous film, but hey, what do ya do?Quantumania is at points fun -- giving me hope that we are indeed building towards something spectacular, FOR REAL THIS TIME -- but largely, it's just ""another one""; a film that could've been truly out there, but wasn't permitted to stray too far from the Kevin Feige vision.One complaint viewers had about the MCU back in the day was that, while it was still full of snappy dialogue and drama-deflating jokes on the one hand, it often also tried too hard to seem grounded on the other hand, like they were still afraid to embrace the comic-book silliness and instead tried to find ways to make these characters seem halfway ""real"" -- often by making the costumes look less fantastical/colorful or having ""self-aware"" comments about the ridiculousness of it all. What's appealing, to some people, about everything post-Infinity War is that the movies dare introduce all kinds of comic-book madness, but most Phase Four films' version of ""being sillier"" is having characters become dopes.And the movies do still exhibit that same self-consciousness. This isn't like RRR, which is even more balls-to-the-wall insane than the Marvel films but also has characters that take their own universe seriously, resulting in a movie that's both funnier and more dramatically effective. If you wanna go see Quantumania, go see it, but the unusually low ratings thus far tell me I'm not alone in feeling a bit weary and that the proverbial Superhero Fatigue is finally here. If you want to be on the safe side, I recommend just staying at home and popping on RRR. Or the previous Puss in Boots film if you wanna see how the side-villain MODOK got his acting industry start when he portrayed Humpty-Dumpty.Funny side-note: In the movie, we see that Lang's career with the Avengers has led to a life of luxury and stardom, making it all the more strange that Falcon has to deal with financial issues and Dhar Mann-tier racist cop archetypes in his own show. Don't yell at me; I'm not saying it's bad when you contribute to a piece of world-building yet elect to change its rules in accordance with a Message™. I'm just saying ""Ah, that's our post-Endgame MCU. May you one day be as chaotic as the DC-verse!""",6,7,TheVictoriousV,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur19932818/?ref_=tturv_usr_166_t,16-Feb-23,

The ragged narrative and lack of drama that were promised in the trailer made the film a disappointment for me personally. That's the problem of inflated expectations, which appeared to me thanks to a really cool trailer.I'll scold the script first. It seems that the screenwriters could not fully develop the potential of the film and forgot about the relevance of the whole action in relation to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Again and again we see an emphasis on penny intrigues and a purely situational turn of events, which, of course, could work if it were combined with something grandiose. Viewers were promised a large-scale conflict between the new antagonist Kang and Ant-Man and his team. In fact, several new and little-remembered characters with jokes aka ""how many holes does anyone have"" appeared before us, and one of the comic villains turned into a laughing stock at all.One of the main drawbacks of the film is the ragged presentation of the material. The film unsuccessfully veers between drama and trash comedy, which creates an ambiguous impression. Sometimes it seems that the film cannot decide which genre it wants to represent and this reduces the quality of the project, literally dropping it somewhere below the baseboard.But the biggest disappointment for me was the expressionless antagonist Kang the Conqueror. The way it was announced by the creators, the way it was shown in the trailer, absolutely cannot be compared with what happened to be seen in the picture itself. The motivation of the character is poorly worked out, although it is worth paying tribute to the actor Jonathan Majers, who tried, there are no questions to his game, but there are a lot to his hero. The character turned out to be just boring and is forgotten literally five minutes after viewing.The already familiar heroes in the person of Ant, Wasp, Pym family and Scott Lang's daughter were not impressed either. Banal dialogues, movement for the sake of movement, scenario moves do not leave a chance for real drama in this project, although it begins a new chapter of the Cinematic Universe and was announced as a large-scale epic. However, it is worth paying tribute to the visual effects team. The picture is at a height. The quantum world into which the main characters fall is able to surprise the viewer with its scale and all possible colors. The imagination of the creators pleases, showing unusual pictures of a tiny world.In general, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantum Mania"" is definitely not the best movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. A weak drama, an ill-conceived script and a passing plot do not allow this film to stand out from other projects. If you are a fan of the Marvel Universe, then this movie is certainly worth watching, but you should be prepared for the fact that after watching it, an unpleasant feeling of disappointment may remain.6 out of 10.",3,1,alekspredator87,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur52780913/?ref_=tturv_usr_169_t,11-May-23,

It was the first Marvel movie I saw in theaters and was satisfied with it when it was over. I like the typical Ant-Man humor in it. For me, it's supposed to be an Ant-Man movie, so it's supposed to have jokes and not always make sense. I find the humor in the Ant-Man movies good, and it's definitely better than the humor in Thor Love and Thunder. I like how this movie covers the Quantum Realm in detail. It was just a mysterious place that is smaller than atoms in the first two Ant-Man movies, and was a plot device for time travel in Endgame, but in this movie, we finally get to actually see it in detail.I find the CGI alright, of which my opinion is better than other people. I find MODOK is done right. I find it where MODOK is not possible to do in live action without looking somewhere on the uncanny spectrum. He's either creepy or weird and can't really be anything else while remaining comic accurate. People like comic accurate but MODOK is a character people might hate on either way (not comic accurate, complain about being not comic accurate. Comic accurate, complain about looking weird or creepy).I also find it does an alright job setting up the Multiverse. It has Kang the Conqueror, of whom in known to be the Multiversal threat throughout the Marvel multiverse. It is definitely a film that would help build up to the whole multiverse in the MCU'S future (even if it bombed, it helps show what to try to stay away from).Overall, it's by third favorite comic book film of 2023.",0,0,auskooper,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur168372141/?ref_=tturv_usr_170_t,12-Apr-24,

It actually feels basically all but completely unnecessary and is extremely predictable along the way.If the movie didn't have this weird alien aesthetic that works, it would have probably flopped, for me. The marketing makes it seem like an action packed, quite serious, but family almost travelogue - but it's basically just lots of weird stuff with dumb gags and jokes.

9,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8894772/?ref_=tturv_perm_172,A pure science-fiction adventure,"Surprise! I really enjoyed this movie, which was surprising as it seems to be getting lambasted by critics and audiences alike. And on one hand, I can understand; people are getting superhero fatigue, and Ant-Man never was the most popular character out there. On the other hand, this third entry in the ""Ant-Man"" series of films is a science-fiction adventure that I, for one, couldn't get enough of.If you're a fan of straight up sci-fi, I honestly can't imagine how you wouldn't enjoy this movie; virtually from beginning to end, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" is an exercise in engaging world building and incredible visuals - on a purely visual aspect this movie is a 10 out of 10; the movie takes viewers through a world - a universe - that is so interesting to look at that I found myself almost jaw-dropped for 90% of this film's runtime. But of course, great visuals can only take a movie so far.Luckily, ""Quantumania"" delivers on pretty much every other aspect as well. With fantastic chemistry between its main characters, the film is a sheer delight to watch in terms of characterization and character interaction. Paul Rudd is charismatic as usual, but I was even more impressed with Michael Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Kathryn Newton; you'd think the ridiculous subject matter would lead to ridiculous performances, but they're all bringing their A-game here, which was unexpected but appreciated. Now I know what you're thinking: ""How was Jonathan Majors?"" Let's talk about it.Introducing a new villain, Kang the Conqueror, ""Quantumania"" is apparently setting up the next biggest Marvel baddie. And while I found Kang to have a lot of potential, I wasn't particularly impressed with his villainy here, as much as I enjoyed Majors in the role. While Majors adds a cold menace to the character, I found a lot of Kang's dialogue to be trite and evil for the sake of being evil. While his initial introduction is more nuanced, the film foregoes that, and instead makes the character extremely one dimensional. That said, I did feel as if he was a worthy enough opponent in this movie, and I am interested to see the future development of this character.If you're going to see an MCU movie, you most likely care about the action; while ""Quantumania"" didn't have a ton of action in it (the movie focuses more on adventure than action), the action it did have satisfied me. While the action is extremely CGI heavy for the most part, I found it exciting in its sci-fi centricity - it really felt like I was watching a ""Star Trek"" movie, and while some people may not like that, I absolutely loved it.Overall, I had a fantastic time with this movie. Audiences seem to be turning on Ant-Man and on the MCU in general, but I found this to be a refreshing take on the genre with its emphasis on pure science-fiction adventure. You may not enjoy this as much as I did, but if you're a Marvel fan, you owe it to yourself to give this a watch.",9,11,darkreignn,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur33659536/?ref_=tturv_usr_172_t,26-Feb-23,

I enjoyed the first 2 Ant Man movies. There was something comforting to the humble Paul Rudd playing Ant man. The characters all fit in perfectly with a simple story. Nothing spectacular, but simple , comedic, and worthwhile.This one on the other hand totally sacrificed Ant Man's character to serve as exposition and did a poor job with that. The characters themselves all felt like different people. Hank Pym feels uninspired , Hope goes along for the ride, and Ant Man is the opposite of his old humble persona which I loved before. His character served as some relief in the past for the other bombastic Marvel personalities. The casting of Cassie doesn't quite fit well with me either.This movie felt like a combination of the worst parts of Spy Kids 3D, Star Wars , and Sharkboy and Lava girl. There was a lot of opportunity to do much more with the quantum realm and this just felt like no effort was put into it. The sets themselves look like they were made in an early 2000s movie. At one point someone in the theaters chair broke and instead of laughing at the movie the audience got amusement out of that.For all the build up nothing ever quite adds up in the story. The one saving grace is that Jonathan Majors is a high quality actor. Even with his skill set they still nearly ruined him with a full and uninspiring script. I came into this so excited after how they concluded Loki season 1, but what a let down.They are going to need another stellar Loki season to try to get this phase back on track.

But Quantumania is a story riddled with holes (unlike one of its best side characters) and inconsistencies, and doesn't particularly add to the MCU as a whole either. For a movie deemed the most important for the next phase of the movies, it didn't have any long-lasting effects at all. It's nowhere near as fun as its predecessors (Luis is sorely missed), and too many of the characters are annoying or frustrating to watch (or barely present at all). And then there's the CG world that lacks any frame of reference, and some really bizarre editing decisions. I give Quantumania an enjoyable yet flawed entry into the MCU canon; 7/10.

Good to see the one director get to do all three films in a trilogy, with a few nods back to the original film (now 8 years ago!).""QuANTuMANia"" follows the combined family - Scott, Hope (Lilly), daughter Cassie (Newton), Hope's Mum Janet (Pfeiffer) & Dad Hank (Douglas) - as they're sucked into the quantum realm and try to get their way back to Earth.

Why movies like Eternals failed is that there is yet another character origin story to tell. Another world to build. But that is only one problem with this movie. I liked the first two Antman films, not my favourite MCU character, but Paul Rudd definitely added decent charm into the mix. So that is another problem, lack of Paul Rudd screentime and less humour. Except for a scant witty remark here and there, this is not meant to be a fun film. Even when Bill Murray shows up for a cameo. He says his lines and tries to be provocative. But exits rather quickly and gets tossed into the pile of new characters being introduced in this movie. Which is the biggest problem with this film. Too many new characters. It is a problem with world building, here the Quantum universe, having to establish all these groups of people and their stake in things.For instance, this teenage girl was introduced and had some stake in the whole universe being destroyed or something. After the big battle at the end, they return to the girl and now the universe won't be destroyed, or something. I had literally forgotten about her. Same thing for Bill Murray, what was he all about? It goes on. There is a big group of CGI characters. The only one that stood out was a walking lava lamp who wished he had holes. Worse, the second act gets bogged down as we must have this quantum universe explained to us. ""Why didn't you mention to us that you (saw this stuff, met these people) when you were down here?"" is constantly asked of Michelle Pfeiffer's character. I think too much is made of her hiding this stuff. She didn't want to talk about it, let's move on.The last problem I had with this movie was the ugly environments that made up the Quantum universe. Like most films like this recently, things are really dark. I mean physically dark, with many things going on the big screen hidden in shadows, at night. In general, I get tired of being immersed in gloomy worlds for two hours. I thought the trend was going away from the dark themed blockbusters. I guess filmmakers prefer the dark again.So to sum up:
Too little Paul Rudd and his humour
Too many new characters
Too much world building
Too much time explaining all these things
Ugly environmentsI give it a five out of ten. I will give some stars for staying in bounds by not running over two hours, and being a mostly watchable film with no major stumbles.

Otherwise there is nothing proper that seems to have build up in this movie. First of all JONATHAN MAJORS as KANG is PURE GOOSEBUMPS. What a performance by him literally Stoles the show from everybody. The way he portrays the role of kang is simply superb. Story and plot is very weak as compare to previous antman movies. J don't why so rush director has to introduce kang if you don't have a proper story and you all just rely on Kang's Shoulders. I'm shocked to see that Wasp doesn't even have a proper dialogue in the whole film I mean literally she is one of the main characters and you didn't even give her the proper role she deserves. Very poor writing, Screenplay is fast very fast paced doesn't even build the main characters properly and rush to conclusion.

4,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9102529/?ref_=tturv_perm_184,I've never been so bored watching a MCU film.,"Going in with low expectations still did not help this movie out any. The most interesting thing about it is how lazy and bad the whole thing is. I gave it a 4/10 but to be honest, even that feels a little gracious.Quantumania does one thing well, and that's its villain. Aside from Jonathan Major's strong performance as Kang the Conqueror, everything else failed to rise above mediocrity. The movie fails at what Ant-Man has always been best at, being funny. The jokes just don't work this time. I think the only time I chuckled was more from weirdness than actual good humor. I was fully expecting this to be a darker, more emotional movie than the previous two, but I felt nothing inside as I watched. There was no chemistry between the characters. None of their affection for each other was believable. At one point, Scott and Hope share an ""I love you"" moment, but it felt more awkward than sweet. And as for what Kathryn Newton brought to the character of Cassie, it made me wish they had never recast the character. I love a good father/daughter element in a movie but this one falls flat. As hard as the actors tried, Scott and Cassie come across more like strangers who are trying to care about each other.Almost everything in the movie felt forced and melodramatic. It's riddled with clichés. It's almost criminal how much they stole from other movies. The dialogue at times sounds straight up copied and pasted from other scripts. It's all so passionless and uninspired. It honestly feels like the goal was to get us well introduced to Kang and that nothing else really mattered. It seems to try to be as colorful and crazy as Guardians of the Galaxy, but it looks more like a Spy Kids movie. In other words, it's often visually cheesy. M. O. D. O. K is a prime example of this. His presence in the movie is just annoying. The ending of the film feels like a cop-out. Stuff just conveniently happens for them. I have my issues with Thor: Love and Thunder, but it at least entertained me. Quantumania is simply no fun.",1,0,koltonbrett,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur144012653/?ref_=tturv_usr_184_t,5-Jun-23,

All the acting was good no complaints, I thought Jonathon Majors stood out as the best .What I didn't likeA story has to have a begining a middle and an end. They don't have to be presented in that order, but they do all have to connect.This film connected them very very badly.Almost as if somebody said ""I loved Starwars and all the desert people and the jawas, can we do that?""
""Yes sure"", they answered ""we can just say they have been zipped to a multi-underverse, through an inter galatic wormhole by a falangee, the audience will love it""So there were long scenes that were clearly inspired (to be nice) or more accurately a 'rip off' of star wars - That was the first 'Jar' assuming we swallowed the glib convenient way our heroes arrive in 'star wars desert scene'. Hundreds of 'ant men' reminded me of the Matrix and the agents - another 'borrowed' idea?Bill Murray appears as Lord something or other - that had not the slightest relevance to anything. The scene could be deleted and you wouldn't noticeThereafter it's just a mish mash of scenes. There is no real story for the audience to invest in.That I think is the problem. This is not a story, it's just a slide show of 'cool scenes' which individually don't tell a story, or tell it badly and boringly.I literrally was watching the film and waiting for it to end. 5/10Would I watch it again ? Absolutely not.This film should be despatched, back to the multi-underverse of low quality mediocrity from whence it came, as quickly as possible.Not worth the price of a cinema ticket.",2,5,comps-784-38265,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur46420090/?ref_=tturv_usr_186_t,19-Feb-23,
5,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8879261/?ref_=tturv_perm_187,Now this isn't an Avengers Level Threat...,"Who would've thought that a hero called ""Ant-Man"" would succeed in a trilogy? I massively enjoyed the first one but found the second one to be quite forgettable. I loved the idea of smaller stake stories for Ant-Man films. It was a little surprising to hear that Ant-Man 3 would have bigger stakes as I didn't find this to suit the character. Is this a good entry for the little guy or quantum garbage?The greatest highlight of this film is the antagonist, Kang the Conqueror, played by Jonathan Majors. Kang is fearsome and menacing with a terrific performance by Jonathan that reminds me of Darth Vader. He steals the show in every scene, to the point that I was actually rooting for him. I am also glad that his performance is vastly different to the variant we saw in the Loki (2021) show. I can't wait to see more of Kang in the future! In terms of performance, I also enjoyed seeing more of Michelle Pfeiffer as Janet van Dyne. She was barely in the second Ant-Man film but here she is front and centre. She shines in her performance and perfectly illustrates the guilt and fear her character is experiencing. Paul Rudd is still charming and charismatic as Scott Lang. His relationship with his daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton) is still the main core of his character. We get to see 'some' serious moments with his character which was nice to see.Another thing I liked was the overall design of the Quantum Realm. The world and the living beings in the Quantum Realm were interesting. It had a very Star Wars/Mad Max feel to it with the blend of sci-fi, deserts and alien-like creatures. The 3rd act of the movie is also quite entertaining. For the most part, it's a giant CGI battle with lots of things happening on screen but it is fun to watch. I especially loved seeing Kang in action because we get to see how much of a beast he is compared to previous villains.However, the writing is very weak. There are a lot of silly dialogues that just made me roll my eyes. It doesn't help that for some reason Marvel is still doing forced unnecessary humour. If this story is meant to be higher stakes then make it serious! The quips get overly repetitive. The first half is a little dull too with minimal interesting things happening. It doesn't take until over halfway through the movie to actually see Kang. Additionally, the ending was disappointing. It is very bland and safe which is a shame as this film could've delivered a shocking and memorable ending. This movie is also meant to build up hype for the next Avengers film but that ending fails to do even that.MODOK is also in this film and it is a pointless addition. Not only do they change the character completely from their comic counterpart, but their role in the story is also absolutely irrelevant. Could take them out of the story and nothing will change. Despite the film being called Ant-Man and the Wasp, both Scott Lang and Hope feel like side characters in their own film. They have no character development and are just kind of there for the ride. Janet is more of a main character than them. I also don't like this trend in these recent Marvel films of Marvel characters looking out for these young characters. Cassie is the next in this trend and is also an annoying character like many of them before. I think Kathryn Newton is fine in her role but her character just isn't written well to be likeable enough for me to care. This is also a very CGI-heavy film and for the most part, it is okay but there are definitely times when it looks rough. The editing, especially during action sequences, can be really bad. They tend to do too many quick cuts during action sequences and for some reason use the shaky cam in 2023!Overall, Ant-Man 3 is a bit disappointing. There was a lot of potential for this to be something great but the execution is quite poor. This isn't a great start to Phase 5 and I am getting worried about the future of the MCU. They need to do a better job at making people hyped for the next Avengers-level threat as this film isn't making me think this is a threat equal to or better than Thanos. I'm hoping future Marvel films start building up this new threat because they need to show us that this new threat is worthy of our attention.",4,5,MovieWarfare,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur112855274/?ref_=tturv_usr_187_t,18-Feb-23,

While the first Ant-Man film introduced a refreshing comedic twist to the superhero genre, and the second had its moments despite a dip in quality, this third entry feels like a regurgitation of familiar ideas without any significant innovation.One of the main drawbacks of Quantumania is its heavy reliance on non-stop CGI spectacle at the expense of a quality script. The film bombards viewers with over-the-top action sequences that quickly become exhausting, leaving little room for character development or meaningful storytelling.However, there are a few bright spots in the film. Jonathan Majors delivers a standout performance as Kang, displaying his range and talent. However, recent personal matters surrounding the actor may potentially jeopardize the character's inclusion in upcoming MCU entries, which is a concern for fans of the franchise.On a positive note, Michael Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Evangeline Lilly enjoy increased screen presence, and their performances are commendable. Their chemistry helps to inject some much-needed life into the film, even if the overall product falls short.Unfortunately, the portrayal of M. O. D. O. K., a formidable Marvel villain, fails to translate effectively from the page to the screen. The character lacks the depth and menace that fans have come to expect, resulting in a missed opportunity to create a compelling antagonist.Curiously, the design and plot similarities to the Star Wars prequels are hard to ignore, as is the inclusion of several Star Wars cast members. While some may appreciate the homage and cross-pollination, it feels like a distraction and adds little value to the overall narrative.Despite the charm and charisma brought by Paul Rudd and the standout performance by Jonathan Majors, these factors alone are not enough to offset the criticisms of the film. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania falls short of its predecessors and fails to deliver a fresh and engaging addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.FORMAT: 4K Ultra HD Blu-rayVIDEO: 9/10.AUDIO: 8/10.MOOFIEMETER: 6/10.",1,0,gettodamoofies,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur150414589/?ref_=tturv_usr_189_t,30-May-23,

The last few MCU films have been lackluster at best. Not counting the sort of stand alone Spider-Man No Way Home. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is supposed to start the Phase 5 of this thing and if it goes on like this it's going to get worse!!! This film is of course competently made, looks good and is not horrible but is completely uninspired and like pretty much everything out of the MCE factory since Endgame it's totally forgettable. The reason that the MCU was so successful is that the films had characters we cared about. Stakes were there, of course they were lightoments but there were heroes to root for and some pretty good villains. We cared about what was on the screen. I didn't care at all about what I saw in Quantumania. Not that every film from Iron Man to Endgame was great but they were mostly at least better than average. The two previous Ant-Man films were among the weakest but were still more memorable than this one. The acting in Quantumania is fine but but again no one to really care about. Even Paul Rudd who is usually very engaging seemed just flat and disinterested here. He seems to be phoning it in. The only notable performance is Jonathan Majors as Kang the Conqueror but he alone can't save the film from being a complete snooze fest. I was actually bored fir much if the film.Just below average in an MCU that is just churning out film after film with diminishing results. I think Kevin Feige and company should go back and see what made these films good when they first started.

The standout from this film is obviously the introduction of Kang (Jonathan Majors) into the MCU. Another run of the mill Marvel film, nothing to crazy and it follows the very formulaic standard at this point. The computer effects and the green screen compositing in this one looked super off to me, I saw this in IMAX with a couple of friends and everything looked very digital like I was watching a video game cutscene. Some of the jokes landed, some fell flat on their face. MODOK (Corey Stoll) is mainly used as a throwaway sidekick for Kang and it's honestly just really goofy to see on the big screen and is not used to his full potential as a villain.This is another mediocre entry into Marvel's extremely lackluster Phase Four; I feel like this franchise has definitely lost all of it's steam and momentum after the conclusion of the Thanos saga. I had hopes that this one would finally be the one to break the series out of its lull, but I guess that we'll have to keep waiting for that. It's not terrible by any means, but it's one that will only really be remembered for the characters it introduces and not for the quality of the film itself.",3,3,xiaoli7377,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur123364108/?ref_=tturv_usr_191_t,17-Feb-23,

It doesn't work great, but it's far from a total failure.Firstly, highest praises must be given to the costumers, production designers, and visual effects artists. They came together and crafted a world in the Quantum Realm that is one of the most visually fascinating and thoroughly detailed I have ever seen put to film.And given that probably 85% of what's ever on-screen in this film was not really physically present, it's miraculous how convincing the world they created really looks, sounds, and feels.As an added praise to these artists, they really picked up the slack where director Payton Reed left it. The way he helms the in-camera scenes-particularly the action-heavy ones-is frustratingly dull, without a single shot feeling like it's anything more than functional.But the sweeping, huge wide shots of action that are entirely CG were largely breathtaking, framing the chaos in gorgeous clarity. I never thought I'd find the Quantum Realm to be such an intriguing setting, but they pulled it off.As for the narrative, there are definitely a couple of rushed character moments that could've used more emotional development, but the relationship between Scott and his daughter Cassie really does give this movie its heart.Their scenes together worked really well as I could feel them yearning for time they had lost and for an understanding they could have built. It largely made up for the sadly underdeveloped and criminally under-utilised villain Kang.Even though he explains his plans and motivations in great, long-winded detail, I still never felt like I understood him. It's all kept incredibly vague, and it made the story's huge stakes hard to care about.As the film neared its end, I was really happy with where it was going. It seemed like they were going for a tragic conclusion to a trilogy that would hit like a gut-punch given the story's parent-child themes.But then the ending really came, and I was disappointed. The film had built up a lot of momentum and was going somewhere really somber and profound, but they were too cowardly to stick the landing.The ending plays it very safe, clumsily wrapping everything up so we don't get too serious with it all.This is a film that I largely enjoyed for its artistic distinction from other MCU films. It could have been great, but it needed tighter focus and it needed commitment to the weighty ideas that it played with.",17,22,benjaminskylerhill,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur117768316/?ref_=tturv_usr_192_t,17-Feb-23,

The main problem to me is the ending and the crazy amount of plot conveniences and basic pure stupidity put in this film. I think they needed to explain somethings in this film and fix its ending to fully pull me in to the Quantum world.

I have always thought some MCU movies could at time be nothing more than mindless action and that´s fine, that just doesn't get high ratings from me. I have my bottom MCU films like everyone else, but this, this is the new low. This is one of the most soulless movies I have ever watched and while it didn't infuriate me as other of my lowest ranked movies did, this one just left me without a single feeling in my body. This phase of the MCU has been disappointing on so many levels and delivered the one bad to mediocre movie after another, but I have now seen the low point where the light doesn't shine, where pure numbness exist and Marvel finally became nothing more than colors and sounds from your TV and nothing more.Scott Lang, now not really doing anything with his life is confronted by his daughter who has made a device that can enter the quantum realm again. Janet tries to stop them from activating the device, but the entire Van Dyne family is dragged into the Quantum realm. They most now find a way while avoiding the evil overlord of the quantum realm, Kang.What really sets me off about this movie is the lack of care, lack of good storytelling but mostly lack of a soul. This is a movie that feel fully AI generated where anyone could have written it and it uses so many basic tropes, clichés and basic story devices it´s painfully obvious you are just watching a movie. I was never sucked in, never cared for anything or anyone and I was just watching colorful screens and hearing noises instead of watching a movie. There was nothing here for me to get me engaged and when I pretend care more for a character with a lamp for a head than any of our mains and villains, that's a bad thing. At least other Marvel movies were just poorly written or infuriatingly written where you get some emotions, here, nothing.The characters aren't really characters here. They are vessels for the storytelling and nothing more. They don't do anything, barely have arcs, and barely represent humans. They act and feel like written robots just moving from A to B and dose whatever the movie wants them to do. Once again, the soullessness shows itself. Antman feels barely like himself. His family are just there, and the title character Wasp are barely in the movie. The balancing of the 5 different main characters isn't there and we never get to connect with any of them. The new characters are also just here and when the villain MODOK has more of a character arc than any of our main characters that's a problem.You have heard about it but it really is that bad. The effects are so terrible in this movie. We are given an entirely new world to explore, but none of it has any impact because it´s just like brown and because they do the green screen trick, out of focus. I want to see what´s going on in the background, I want to see the quantum realm. But I´m given nothing but blur. The problem with that is I can only see this movie as characters standing up against a wall trying to act. The visual medium that movies are, are not utilized at all here, it´s just person one, talking to themselves against a brown wall of blur. It´s embarrassing to watch. MODOK looks like absolute garbage with nothing more than a stretchtool used and in general everything just looks so underwhelming.The quantum realm doesn't really fell like it makes any scenes at all. It actually feels like an asset flip with random characters and creatures just being here because why not. I don't understand the world and never felt in awe over how it worked because it´s just a normal town with random characters thrown into it.This movie is split into two separate storylines that are kind of just mushed together in the end because that's what´s supposed to happen. The lack of character and the terrible dialogue leaves none of the two stories interesting and compelling.I have to talk about this terrible script. It is clearly someone's first and you might think that you should cut it some slag then. Well to me, that's no excuse when your 30 something movies in to a franchise, this is where you get the big guns. The plot is clearly an executives clip notes as to what is spoused to happen in the movie and the rest is plastered together with mushy tropes, clichés and writing 101. The dialogue is not how real people talk, it´s whatever is need to be said to move the movie forward and give foreshadowing. The characters have to act like absolute morons in order to make the movie work. Why has Janet not told anyone about Kang before? Why isn't she informing her family at all? It´s infuriating that the characters don't act like humans and are forced to act badly in order to make the movie have surprises. None of the actors can really pull of the stilted robotic dialogue and the acting in general is not good here. I think Jonathan Majors dose the best job here, until the end credit scene rolled around.The humor doesn't really land for the most part for me. Every kind of humor is thrown at the wall so eventually something will land. Random equals funny, dragged out things, word play so on so forth.But this was an introduction to a big bad and to be honest, I´m not afraid. Ant man can win against him, his not a thread. His motivation is also so vague it hurts and I hope we get more of a motivation from him later. This was just a movie to tell you ""hey, this guy is a thing"" and that's all it does. The movie really has nothing going for it and the character arcs are not important and barely done at all. Everything is package in such a cookie cutter way that it hurts to watch.I know I have rambled a lot and it sounds like I have a lot of emotions, but the funny part is, I don't. I feel nothing for this movie and it´s one of the movies where I just felt like I just wasted X amount of time of my life. I wasn't moved or was asked to feel any emotions what so ever and once again it was nothing more than colors and noises from my TV.",7,5,mickeythechamp,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur52112075/?ref_=tturv_usr_197_t,19-May-23,

4,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9076942/?ref_=tturv_perm_201,"A mildly entertaining mess, often cringeworthy","The MCU has really been falling apart in phase 4. WandaVision was decent but disappointing by the end. No Way Home was pretty good. Guardians 3 was quite good. The rest have all been somewhere between okay and horrible. Most of it mediocre or just really bad. Quantumania unfortunately continues that trend. It's quite bad.Part of the problem is that it tries to do too much, but in a rushed, lazy and unearned way. That's the key word perhaps: unearned. It tries to have all these big epic moments, heartfelt moment, action spectacle, comedy, etc., but none of it feels earned. In contrast, Infinity War and Endgame were fan service, but carefully constructed, patient, creative fan service.Jonathan Majors is much better here than in Loki, which is literally my least favourite performance I've ever seen in anything. I'm not kidding. It was so over-the-top and random, so frivolous. But here, at least Kang seems more patient and menacing. If he's a conqueror who's been around for hundreds of years, or whatever, he should be very calm, confident and perhaps strange - who wouldn't go a bit weird after so long? Majors is a highlight of the movie, though still not that great - the standard is so low for the rest of the movie.Most of the characters either do nothing or are unlikable. Ant Man's daughter was so cute in the first two movies and their dynamic felt very warm, natural and funny. The kind of silly stuff we remember from early childhood. Dad just being funny and clever all the time. But now I couldn't stand her character. She just seems so bossy and sassy for no reason. She's a genius, which is now a cliche in the MCU. It wasn't earned. At least Stark took a while to develop his gear.Some of the action and visuals are okay. It's mildly entertaining. Some of the CGI is impressive, I guess, but I didn't care much. Actually, the music was pretty decent which was a surprise. But it's a bit like polishing a turd, you know?MODOK looked pretty stupid without his mask, but then I guess he would look pretty stupid in real life anyway. Maybe it's not bad CGI, but just too weird for us to accept. He did look kind of cool with his mask on and the deep voice. It felt like a wasted opportunity though.The movie tried its best to build up MODOK and Kang and some parts were a little bit exciting or cool. But not much. The plot is just too messy. Nobody communicates properly, especially Pfeiffer's character. She keeps everything a secret, because the script says so, but then is forced to reveal things later, when it's too late. It's just frustrating.Paul Rudd is likable as always, but doesn't get to do all that much. He's a side character in his own movie. And he lacks much purpose. He's largely overshadowed by the older Pyms, his daughter, his girlfriend and ants. The ants also felt underused. And I missed Rudd's old friends from the earlier movies. They were funny and likable. The ant playing drums was hilarious. This movie feels empty by comparison.Some of the quirky characters were sort of interesting but went nowhere. There are no consequences and the world makes no sense so it's hard to care. It's just anything goes without any proper world-building. Instead of 20 different species/groups, pick one or two and make them compelling. Give their world some kind of structure and purpose.Murray's cameo was alright but didn't change much. None of the movie was really outright terrible, just lame, messy and by-the-numbers. Some lines were just awful though. And some of the plot contrivances were really predictable and uninspired.I enjoyed some of the movie a bit. Kang's character has a lot of potential. But they barely make use of it. This could have been great - Ant Man being a humble and funny character, against an epic new time-traveling villain. But it's mostly a failure. With decent music and a big budget but horrible writing and unpleasant characters. Oh well.",2,1,Christopher_Reid,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur13995491/?ref_=tturv_usr_201_t,25-May-23,
8,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8899755/?ref_=tturv_perm_202,Marvel hunkers down,"Marvel hunkers down with its Multiverse theme and begins its Phase Five chapter of the MCU with a complex story of time. As the title suggests, the majority of the film involves the quantum realm where time and space are diluted and distorted the further ""down""you go. It's 1989's Honey, I Shrunk the Kids with much more magnification, so a dust particle in that version is a floating Everest in the, umm, quantumverse. How human-like entities live and have built a bustling city there is a whole other movie! How Kang and Janet knew each other for most of her time there, and how Kang ended up there is what this film elaborates, in bright, flashy colour!But, if you take away all the gorgeous green screen, ignore the setting and background, the marvelous suprise actors that appear, and the mesmorizing portrayal of Kang, you are left with a story about a daughter and her father. Cassie Lang is all grown up now, trying to make up for all those (5) years her dad and the Pym's went missing, either from the blip or lost in the quantum realm or in jail. Her father, Antman, is her hero above all other Avengers. And a lesson he taught her in the very first Ant-Man appears in action in this film. But the fame has gone to her dad's head, and he fails to see her achievements.All the while, Janet and Kang's backstory is revealed in flashes while our heroes, separated in the universe inside our world, face one danger after another. As Janet races to save her granddaughter, who is on the run with Scott, Dr. Hank begins to see his wife in a new light as her past catches up with them.A great entry into the majestic storytelling arc of comic books to film transition. I never forget the first Comic Books that caught my attention as a child were the ones based on mythologies - which we were learning at the time in school. So the Viking myths of Thor, the monsters and trails of the Odyssey, Hercules' strength and valor, and the power of morals all told in coloured boxes and speech bubbles are now portrayed by great actors and production crews, and yet the ideas, emotions and beliefs are still there under the bright lights and big bangs! That's what elevates Marvel movies, in my opinion.The filmmakers behind these 31 superhero films have solved the puzzle of keeping seats in butts, or vice versa, as the longer these films become, the longer we can sit through them without a break- toilet or distractions of any kind (smart phones)! I found the balance between dialogue/exposition, action sequences, and comedic breaks perfectly balanced to draw my attention back to the story just as I was phasing out. Maybe I was having a good attention day, too! For a minute or two I was trying to figure out where Cassie's Kathryn Newton was recognisable from, and it was two series I'd seen: Big Little Lies and, the lacklastre Netflix 'Lord of the Flies'-type show: The Society.The soundtrack was another surprising quality that at first I thought a let down, but rejoiced at the decision to keep it less Guardians and more original soundscapes by the end of the film. It balanced the here and there elements by using the trailer's Elton John anthem during the normal ""here"", and funky or jazzy sounds in the quantum ""there"". And even in the quantum realm, it seems, bands are formed and positions taken, like a Mad Max film, and not just the costumes!A nod to AntZ and Avatar, I'm sure, were made throughout the telling of this tall tale by the Yes Man & New Girl director Peyton Reed, his now-known style seeping through the screen. As the second trailer showed, when a good dad is worth fighting for, the good daughter steps up. The man being swallowed by the ant vortex mountain and saved by his loving daughter's outreached hand says more than a million novels could express, in whichever universe you can imagine!And this brings me to what I like to call: Multiverse for Dummies. Scientifically speaking, we are vibrating, humming, and energy-filled atoms that create a type of force field around each molecule, so in essence, around our whole being. By creating energy, we are simultaneously creating our own unique snail trail and projecting our ""future"" path. As time is irrelevant, because we only count the girations of the Earth around the Sun: this sun, our sun, not another; then by scientific standards, it could very well be possible to create two diverse paths when, for example, one is faced by a dilemma. One path is created to represent option one, and another to represent option two. This theory exponentionally creates infinite probabilities and/or paths. Is the thought or the intention the creators of this energy trail? So, a multiverse for one person could be every decision and branch thereof they've ever had, from what cereal to eat to whether they should marry or not. Each branch then has branches of its own, and each one to the tiniest twig has a different version of you. And by this theory of mind creating matter, there may even be a spaghetti fingers universe or a jelly pudding one, like other films have suggested. Kang has many versions of himself spread out through infinite branches, and some of them jailed this film's version in the tiny, microscopic quantum realm. The Disney series, Loki, may shed more light on this matter.As a stepping stone towards a great many more multiverse-opening films, this feels safe. A comfortable place to begin considering the possibilities that by deleting and pasting timelines into the already complex Cinematic and Disney Series Universe, we may see a new X-men, Deadpool, Thunderbolts, Blade and, even, the Fantastic Four back for more great stories. And as we know, as one story ends, another is about to begin.",6,7,NestorTheGreat,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur54687345/?ref_=tturv_usr_202_t,1-Mar-23,

I thought after having reflected on the viewers and critics opinions that they would make better MCU movies but looks like they're just stuck in a bad movie spree. I've completely lost hope in MCU but will keep watching because of my stupid completionist side. That aside though...""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" was one of the worst disappointments of 2023 and ruined my day. Here I was after a long day from sitting infront of a computer working from 7 am to 3 pm (I'm a Data Technician with speciality in programming) and thought I would go home and enjoy myself with this movie without watching neither reviews or spoilers and turned out to be my biggest mistake. This was God-awful. No redeeming qualities whatsoever. Didn't make me laugh like the first Antman movie did, hell even the 2nd one. The pitiful attempt at humour bordered on cringe almost. It was so uncomfortable. Also the acting from some of the actors (looking at you, Michael Douglas) were so terrible.I'm sorry for the rant, all in all, I do not recommend this movie to even my worst enemy.

2,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8879464/?ref_=tturv_perm_204,They did it again,"With every new Marvel release seems to come with it a new reason to question if Marvel even knows what they're doing anymore.Ten plus years of good Marvel movies, since the opening of the MCU with Iron Man in 2008 we have been gifted with great entertainment, good writing, and great characters, played by great actors. Now... and now... just look at yourself Marvel, what have you become?I genuinely still want to believe Marvel can return to what made Phases 1 through 3 so good but every new film just kills that hope a little everytime.Now Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, this film is the definition of a mixed bag. I wanted this movie to be good and I wanted to love it and I definitely wanted all the low scores and bad reviews to be wrong this is just not the case.So what is wrong with Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania? Well short answer everything. From poor writing, to cringe dialogue, terrible cgi (which seems to be Marvel's forte now) to absolute piss poor pacing, terrible structure, and no coherent thought anywhere and that's just the first hour of the film.However this atrocity is somewhat saved all thanks to Kang The Conqueror who is played magnificently by Johnathan Majors. For the first time in this entire mess of Phase 4 or now 5 whatever the hell Phase this is, we are treated to a truly menacing, terrifying, ruthless villain who can rival Thanos. He is a true threat and the best villain since Thanos but unfortunately even he is lead to a letdown by the end. Which is the second biggest problem with this film, at soo many moments this film can be better than what it is but the writer is complicit to just keep writing trash! Trash jokes, trash lines, trash everything!The entire first hour of this film is like watching a headless chicken running around, there is no structure as we jump from scene to scene with some of the worst background cgi. If it had nothing to do with Kang I did not care. He literally carried this film on his back.Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania as I said with Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is why writing for a TV show and a major motion picture are two very different things. Why would you hire a writer who has only done some TV stuff and some episodes of Rick and Morty?But the biggest problem from this film is that it suffers a identity crisis, trying soo hard to do soo much and to be soo many different things. Trying to make the Quantum world beautiful and equal to Avatar's Pandora, a story and Sci-Fi epic equal to that of Star Wars, and somewhere trying to be a Marvel film all at the same time.I just keep asking what's the problem Marvel/Disney, is it money? Well that can't be it because you threw 200 million dollars at this. Do you simply not care anymore? Or maybe you keep hiring writers who DO NOT care about these characters and where they come from. I've read very little of the Marvel comics in my life and I have more respect for the source material than these writers seem to have.Anyway, I'm just disappointed and rather heartbroken at how Ant-Man is treated here. You were one of my last hopes Ant-Man and now it seems its all up to James Gunn and the Guardians of the Galaxy, perhaps they can become the Guardians of the MCU we will see.Ant-Man you had a good run but you have unfortunately gone the way of Love and Thunder and Multiverse of Madness. He was the smallest hero but was also the biggest... literally biggest because he could grow to like 80 something feet, you at least had two good movies.IMDb: 3/10

Antman is probably one of my favorite MCU movie full stop. Antman and the Wasp as very solid follow up with ties to the greater universe. This im still conflicted about!Theres nothing to say about Paul Rudd that hasnt already been said playing this character! He as always is awesome! Brings the fun in any of the moments of danger in a genuine way. But when you get the characters that are meant to bring this back to earth like Hank and Hope being the comic relief it just doesnt work. They try to make jokes but these kind of characters just shouldnt be!Majors on the other hand is an awesome addition to the MCU and can certainly take the franchise going forward. I would have loved to see at least one of the ant family die in this it would have really shown how far Kang is going to take things! With his recent arrest im really not sure how the MCU is going to hold up losing this character thats been being built for the last couple of years!The story was just to vast for the type of stories that we have come to expect from Antman. We love the heist movies of the last 2 but this tried to be that and also create a grander segway into the larger MCU. The whole MCU at the moment is rudderless, the best moments of the MCU is when they have time to let the dust settle and then get hyped for the next one. With 3 shows and 4 movies a year its like theres always something MCU going on.

Veb, M. O. D. O. K. They provide some funny moments but once the usual last 30 minutes of huge CGI battles occurs, interest wanes.The real star of Ant-Man 3 is Kang The Conqueror.

Jonathan Majors is fantastic in the role and i can't wait to see him out in the open and tackling the other Avengers.There are some nice cameos from Tom Hiddleston, Owen Wilson & especially Bill Murray, who is great as Lord Krylar with his screen time limited.

Just enjoy.","I see that some reviewer on the web referred to this as Marvel's version of Star Wars. In fact I think there's a lot to that. Loads of weird creatures, a big cast, an evil empire and a rebel alliance, armies of identical storm troopers, and a huge CGI blast that is probably Marvel's biggest yet. This is like Star Wars in the same way that Shang-Chi: The Legend of the Ten Rings was like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.So this is the way they decided to introduce Kang full-on (after a short lead-in on the Loki streaming series) and generally I'm OK with it. Half an hour in to the show I really started to enjoy the ride. (More so, in fact, than I like any of the Star Wars series, which are undeniably splashy but have semi-random plots and dialog aimed at 8 year olds.)I want to give credit to the cast, more than I usually do. The ensemble nature of it works most of the time really well. The 'nuclear family' with Hank Pym, Janet van Dyne, daughter Hope, and Scott and Cassie Lang were all played just fine by Michael Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer, Evangeline Lilly, Paul Rudd, and Kathryn Newton. Though Scott is the headliner, I was pleasantly surprised by how much work they gave to Michelle Pfeiffer and Kathryn Newton -- they rock. If anyone was sidelined a bit it was Lilly (really guys? She's in the title after all). Jonathan Majors is duly impressive as Kang, playing a wildly different version of him than He Who Remains who we saw in Loki. Katy O'Brian and William Jackson Harper are great as rebel leaders with distinctive abilities and make the most of their screen time. And Bill Murray ...Despite the long parade of action scenes and dialog that is just enough to understand what's going on, it flows well from end to end. With short 'bookend' sections in our everyday world, everything takes place in the Quantum Realm. It's all very colorful and imaginative at a level we didn't even see in Doctor Strange Multiverse of Madness.But just a final caveat: if this was *really* a quantum realm in the true physics sense, I probably don't need to say that it wouldn't look anything like this. The real thing? Absolutely anything we take for granted in the everyday world, like, I don't know, gravity? Structures? Sound and air? Light? Dialog? Nonexistent. Objects aren't even defined, they are just probability clouds. So this is all crazy in the same sense as our sci-fi settings like Captain Marvel, Guardians of the Galaxy, and Star Wars too, violate basic principles by using FTL space travel and simultaneity.But I guess that's not the point.

Its still one of the weakest movies of the MCU but after, Love and Thunder, Ms Marvel and She Hulk, its not as bad as those, there ae quite a few things to like. Mainly, the villain, Kang. He absolutely steals the show and every scene he is in, you can feel he is an Avengers level threat and the actor gives his all to make it even better. Scott and some action scenes are also on te good side of the movie, they managed to be entertaining at all time and while these are just few moments, they are enough to save this film a little bit. Buuuuuut, there is also a lot of bad stuff. The quantum world is just boring. Thats just how it is. There is nothing interesting about it, we never know anything about the people living there, we never feel anything for this world, honestly, if it was destroyed or something, I wouldnt even miss it. The side characters are horrible, they do nothing, the Wasp is done so dirty in the movie, that there are times when you forget she even exists, its just at the end when she does something and its not that much. Hank and Janet are also there just to explain scientific things and look smart but besides that, they could very well be dead. And I hated the quantum people, their designs are mostly bad and their jokes are very cringy. The more I think about them, the more I want the quantum realm to be destroyed. Cassie is just there, acting bad, existing and doing absolutely nothing else. The story is just meh, Ant man stealing some stuff for Kang and the side characters trying to find him. Its just ok, but I would have prefered a story more like the first 2 movies, those felt more like ant man movies and had their own style and comedy, things which are mostly ruined in this one. I hope Marvel recovers and goes back into the light path because if they dont and they continue like this, theyre gonna have bad times ahead.",0,1,D4V1D2411,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur106641918/?ref_=tturv_usr_220_t,25-Feb-23,

I wouldnt say its rotten. But its definitely not a top favourite of mine either. Im not sure where I would rank it out of the whole MCU, but in terms of the other Ant-Man films, I still like the first one the best, and Id probably put this above the second one. My biggest gripe with this movie is the ending. Without giving too much away, I wish it had mirrored what Janet had done earlier during a flashback. And I didnt feel it was a satisfying end for Kang. I felt like it took him a peg down on being a badass villain. Which is a shame because I think Jonathan Majors was great in the role. Also, I wouldnt say the CGI is bad but there were a number of moments where it really looked like a bunch of actors standing in front of a green screen. Which I guess is a problem when 95% of your movie takes place in an entirely CGI world. So it kind of took me out a bit as I wasnt fully immersed as I should be. Although CGI wise I think M. O. D. O. K could have looked better. I know hes a weird looking guy to begin with. But it was definitely very uncanny valley in a bad way. Now I dont care that the last Cassie actor got replaced....but I dont think Kathryn Newton was a good replacement. I just didnt feel like she matched the previous Cassie's and I didnt feel like she had a lot of chemistry with the rest of the cast. And my other gripe, for a movie called Ant-Man and the Wasp you'd think they would both be the main characters but Wasp (Evangeline Lilly) didnt have a lot to do in this movie. I mean she also spends a good chunk of the movie separated from Ant-Man (Paul Rudd). Unless the title refers to Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) because she definitely plays a more important role in the film.All that being said though, I had fun with the film. It still has some of that silly Ant-Man humour. I loved the beginning and ending framing device with the voice-over. But the film also has plenty of serious moments that work too. Even though I griped about the ending, I liked where it was heading. Kang just absolutely brutalizing Ant-Man was great. I think the Quantum Realm and getting to explore a different realm was fun and interesting (although a lot of -production and costume wise) did remind me of Star Wars. And I loved the family dynamics in the movie.I rated the film a 7, but I would say its probably more of a 7.5 for me.",9,10,mr_bickle_the_pickle,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur17527919/?ref_=tturv_usr_221_t,19-Feb-23,

I enjoyed it. I think a lot of people went into it expecting a complete tonal change, when of course there wasn't going to be. It's an Ant-Man movie! Although it has some quite intense aspects, it's still a quite fun and light-hearted superhero story. And I must say, it was pretty funny. I've not heard my whole cinema room laugh so much at a MARVEL movie in... Years! I mean, No Way Home was the single greatest cinema experience of my life, with people actually cheering and applauding, but the jokes in Quantumania had the crowd laughing throughout.Now, although it was really fun and I had a pretty great time, it wasn't that amazing on a technical level. I think a lot of people that have watched and reviewed it haven't given it enough credit, though, because it has a great story, decent writing and amazing performances. The biggest problem it has from a technical point of view is the visual effects. They were just super inconsistent, with some shots looking phenomenal, and others looking really bad, with super noticeable green screen.The ending and post-credits scenes definitely take away from my rating. The last act was pretty awesome and epic, but it went downhill very quickly.I'm quite disappointed with the setup they went with for Avengers: The Kang Dynasty. I get what they're going for, but it's just not as good a setup as we hoped they'd have in this, and it's gotten me very uncertain and actually kinda unconfident and somewhat uninterested in the future of the MCU. I don't think I can really say anything more without risking giving any spoilers.Overall, its a decent film that would've been a 7.5/10 if it weren't for the underwhelming and honestly crappy ending and post-credits scenes. I think if you liked the first two movies, then you'll probably enjoy this. It is very dependent on what you like in your comicbook movies, so if you were a fan of the other movies in the Ant-Man trilogy, you'll likely have a good time with this.Oh, one last thing: How did Bill Murray get a character poster and MODOK didn't?

It's probably the most visually interesting of the trilogy only because it has more colors than the first two films combined. He actual visuals and cinematography aren't great though. Everything here feels very unmotivated and bland. It doesn't feel like there is a purpose to any of the shots and they are just going through a checklist of basic shots to get for the scene without feeling creative or interesting. The visuals effects range from okay to just bad. Clearly they didn't spend enough time on them and it really shows here because almost every shot has a lot of visual effects work done on them. There is no sense of size or space in these shots especially towards the end where Cassie Lang is over 10 times the size of MODOK but you really couldn't tell if you just watched the clip and not the whole scene. The story is kind of interesting? They definitely had a really solid first draft that just needed a little more work done but instead of doing that, they just took that first draft and ran with it so a lot of ideas and concepts feel underdeveloped and uninteresting. This could have been solved with a rewrite or two but clearly Feige and them don't care about actually doing that work. Most of the performances are good. Paul Rudd is still doing a great job and Michelle Pfeiffer and Michael Douglas are good as well. Jonathan Majors did a great job as well but with everything that came out after this film came out, the less said the better. Shame that he screwed up his career just as he was taking off. Bill Murray was kind of awful though here but thankfully his scene is short. Kang as the villain was the best part of the film. He was fun and engaging and his plan was interesting but his final scene is awful. For an all powerful being, he goes out really poorly. The humor is all over the place. Sometimes it's funny and sometimes it's unbearably unfunny. There really isn't a whole lot here to like but it's mostly just boring and not bad like Thor 4 and Black Widow.

The symptoms that are here can be seen in many films, cartoons and games of recent years, but this cinematic universe, due to its scale, has collected most of them, which is why it can no longer be said that the film has some problems, but it does it's job and for this you can give it at least 7.

6,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8882072/?ref_=tturv_perm_234,It's fun... but not everything works...,"What happens when you're solely focused on your next big Endgame and try to stuff 6 hours worth of stories into a 2-hour movie? You get a Quantumania. Hours of content being shoved down our throat with absolutely no time to process any of it. But beyond it being overstuffed, all of the charm from the first two movies (specifically the first) has vanished. A lot of Ant-Man's appeal was his operation in a normal sized world, either tiny or large- but when the world he occupies is larger than life itself, the effectiveness of that charm is gone. It has no heart. It is just spectacle for the sake of spectacle.I sound angry. I'm not, I have to say I did like the movie. Quantumania is a fun sci-fi adventure filled with goofy comic book weirdness! It is far from Marvel's best, but I did have a fun time. But there are so many issues... so let me back up a bit and start over...Martin Scorsese's views on comic book movies are no secret; he claims they are more like theme park rides than true cinema. For years, I have staunchly disagreed with this stance, I love the Marvel Cinematic Universe and found so much to appreciate in their films. But after seeing Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, y'know what?He might be right.It pains me to say this, but Quantumania is not a great film. To be clear, I enjoyed the movie. I'd even give it a thumbs up! But it is a fun movie, not a good one. It is, by all accounts, a theme park ride.And frankly, that disappoints me.I come to Marvel for the characters I love, the heart and emotion in the stories, and yes, for the fun superhero action. Infinity War and Endgame were such huge successes not because of how fun they were but because of how they captured people's imaginations and emotions. People felt tied to the characters and couldn't wait to see them all come together. I for one, was so emotionally invested in those films, and all of Marvel at the time.Why do I bring that up? Well, because I felt nothing while watching Quantumania. There is no emotional weight to it, nothing compelling me to invest myself in the story. It is all spectacle, and no substance. I felt so empty coming out of it. It felt so forgettable and I never seemed to actually get into the movie. I just couldn't buy into what it was doing. And I am so crushed to say this, because I was looking forward to this movie so much! I really wanted to love it, but alas, it is the first Marvel movie in a while that I have come very close to not liking.I love the first Ant-Man film, and its sequel Ant-Man and the Wasp has even grown on me over the years. This one felt nothing like them. An Ant-Man film it is not, lacking the spirit and everything else that made the franchise what it was. It is completely different, and delves into very odd corners of the MCU. Doing this isn't a bad thing, but I mourned the loss of the charm that the first two films had. I loved the small-scale heist plots. I loved the simple narrative of a dad trying to get more time with his daughter. I loved the unique action set-pieces; battles taking place on a toy Thomas the Tank Engine, or using a Hello Kitty PEZ dispenser as a weapon. I loved Michael Peña's character, Luis, and his awesome storytelling! It had this really heartfelt and likeable element to it, and was different from what we were used to in the rest of the MCU. Yes, the films did serve as a sort of ""palate cleanser"" after the big Avengers films, but that worked for them! I think the decision to make the third Ant-Man film an ""Avengers-level event"" movie was a mistake, because that essentially forced them to get rid of everything that made these films special. (Including Michael Peña which I will never forgive.)And I gotta blame director Peyton Reed here. He bit off more than he could chew. I can understand wanting to do one of the bigger Marvel movies as the Ant-Man ones are on the smaller side of the universe, but forcing the Ant-Man franchise to become one of the major events was a big mistake. It didn't work. Frankly, Peyton Reed was operating in his niche with the first two films, and he's just completely out of his element with this one. You can tell he is trying so hard to make it a big sci-fi spectacle, but comes up short in almost every way. He just got a little too ambitious. Tonally the film is all over the place, the pacing doesn't make sense, action scenes are cut together really oddly and the film overall seems to have no vision. It just sort of exists. Even with the action scenes, there are no memorable moments, and frankly there were barely any real action scenes in the film. I really can't help but wonder what this trilogy would have looked like had it been helmed by Edgar Wright (who was originally supposed to write/direct the first film).And like I said, it doesn't work as an Ant-Man film by any means. Sure, it has the characters, but them being in the story doesn't change anything. The only characters truly used in the film are Janet van Dyne and Kang. The rest were completely wasted. Scott (Ant-Man) doesn't even have a character arc, he is just kind of there, alongside Hope (the Wasp) and his grown-up daughter Cassie. The characters are likeable and I love seeing them on screen, but they really had nothing to do, and it just felt like what happens when characters show up for cameo appearances in other character's films. The problem is this is an Ant-Man film with no real story for Ant-Man. He feels miscast in his own story, heck, it was unnecessary for him to even be there, and the film never truly explained why he could take on Kang. I just never believed any of it. The film lacked verisimilitude, in terms of character, plot and world-building.Jeff Loveness really needed someone else here to help flesh out his script. It feels like a shell of a great movie. Dialogue isn't great, for one, but that's minor. There are lots of moments that work, but they never add up to anything. There is never any weight to what happens either, it felt like things would happen with no setup or reasoning at all, they just would happen because they had to in order to progress the plot. It's a very by-the-numbers plot that barely holds up and steals so much from other films such as Star Wars. But not great Star Wars... the one I would compare it most to is Rise of Skywalker. Why would you take so much from that? The structure of the film is a mess too, with no discernible 3-act structure - the characters end up in the Quantum Realm, stuff happens, and then all the sudden we're at the end. It just felt like there was no buildup, no real reason for this story to be told. Heck, I try to think back on this movie and it's just a jumbled blur of colours and meaningless content. It's so forgettable and lifeless. It's such a missed opportunity for a great Ant-Man story. (And at this point I wouldn't mind giving them the chance to do an Ant-Man 4 *properly*.) Frankly, there were missed opportunities throughout the entire film, and most of the issues stem from the writing. I really hope either Loveness can come up with a significantly better script for Avengers: The Kang Dynasty, or that Marvel finds a new writer for it... if we're in for more of this in an Avengers movie... count me out.The worst thing is that I'm here complaining about the movie when there were still so many things I liked about it! I can genuinely see how some audiences are enjoying it more than I did, as many standalone elements I really liked and even loved! The problem is, they just never came together to make me love them all as a final product. I liked many of the creative ideas offered up, I really liked the visuals of the Quantum Realm (even if you could very much tell it was shot on green screen/the volume), I liked seeing all the new and returning characters and cast members (Paul Rudd is fantastic and charming as always (too bad he didn't have more to do here), Michelle Pfeiffer is awesome here, and I really liked Kathryn Newton as a grown up Cassie), and I LOVED Kang.Before I go into anything else let me make one thing very clear: Jonathan Majors is INCREDIBLE as Kang the Conqueror.There are some amazing actors in this movie, including Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfeiffer, but Jonathan Majors puts them all to shame. He truly carries the movie; the only times I truly found myself invested were when he was on screen. He is operating leagues above everyone else! He is so menacing and truly embodies the threat of Kang. I was completely blown away by his performance, he stole the entire movie and then some! Truthfully, he was so compelling I found myself almost rooting for him! Kang was even a fantastically written character, he worked the best out of any character in the film and I am super interested to see how they handle both Kang and Majors in the future. But my god, Jonathan Majors can truly do no wrong, he is giving an emotionally acrobatic performance that this film and franchise does not deserve. For instance, much like with Gorr in Love and Thunder, we are only told of what Kang is capable of and what he has done but never shown. Film is a visual medium, it would've been nice to see some of the events we hear about occur, but luckily we have such a fantastic performance from Majors that it's hard not to see Kang as a major threat!Which brings me to an interesting thought... why didn't they just make this a Kang the Conqueror movie? Marvel has never done a villain-centered piece before and it could have been pretty interesting - and certainly would have worked a lot better than this. This film pretty much only works as Part 1 of Marvel's Phase 5 anyways, all the Ant-Man stuff could have been saved for something else, something more fitting.I love Marvel, I really do. It's why I'm being so critical of their missteps when they happen, because I don't want to have to write this again.

Asusual Paul Rudd as ""Scott Lang"" did a great job in his comical character . In third act particularly , face off between Antman vs Kang was brutal and literally rare from Marvel contents (like Green Globin vs Spiderman building fight sequence in NWH) . Post credit scene set's strong foundation to the upcoming projects and Multiverse Saga , best one in recent time . Comedy part worked well in few places .Cons - Usual plot and bland screenplay but somehow keeps out from getting bored . After well establishing the antagonist Kang , his ending in the movie wasn't convincing one . Asusual emotional part was spoiled by irrelevant comedy dialogues . Technically not upto the mark off Marvel standard , CGI and VFXs were too cartoonish and poorly executed in most of the places . Comparing to it's previous movies making was average . Clumsy editing , well noticed in 3rd act .Overall , movie could've been watchable one if they had done better in making and graphics .

you have to admit yourselve that like the music has its peak note and its crescendoes you have already hit the peak note in ""Avengers"". From now on taking the same heroes ""Antman"" in this case whatever villains you will try to create are seen very dull,I have seen this before, or O not again (facepalm) because the viewers are comparing it automatically to ""Thanos"". Nothing can be more interesting than ""thanos"" and his backstories. Here also story has suffered the same.Do the Paul rodd has wittiness as scott lang ? Yes he has , are the jokes landing properly ? Most of them are . But to create the superhero movie they are not enough.because of this it seems o again similar kind of marvel movie.You can see powepacked performers again binded together Major as a major villain, Douglas and for brief bill murray as well. The story is okay, However I would have loved if the antagonist development was carefully done may be 2 to 3 stories to make him ,break him and then recreate him.

Some harsh critics here.Some ppl yeesh.. its like they got a personal vendetta against the Top of the line CGI/Green screens lol. Make no mistake this not some cheap CGI you see in B-lister movies, the quality rivals Avatar #1 & Dr Strange #2 & even newer Star Wars films. Theirs a rich new world with highly creative life forms, plants, structures, as well as stunning futuristic looking settings that yes is CGI n green screen but how else would u make such a futuristic looking background? Would you prefer extras wear rubber suits to play the creatures seen in this film instead of CGI to make them look amazing like some comic book stuff?For the ones seriously whining & complaining this film doesnt connect to MCU in anyway n that its a standalone movie.. theirs tons of Marvel films that tell their own story but then has parts here & there to connect to the overall MCU, even the story of the villain lays the groundworks for future MCU movies. Its ridiculous that some people dont realize it connects lol. I mean how clear of a picture do you gotta draw for ppl to make them see it?The new Avengers movie coming out is called
""The Avengers : Kangs Dynasty"", oh wait the villain in this Antman film is also Kang woww! Mindblowing stuff lol. It even explains & hints how his future role will be in the MCU, you gotta be very low intelligence to not put 2 & 2 together.Now the story could have been better but I felt they did an alright job to try & connect things to the marvel universe & set things up for the future to come. While yes alot of the movie might seem like its a standalone movie but what many clearly dont comprehend is this film has just opened the doors to a brand new universe filled with brand new life forms & tons of new settings in the Quantum Realms n can litterally spawn spinoffs just about the Quantum Realm ppl cuz of how richly diverse n new it is.Not to mention after the Loki Tv series, this is practically the next stage in story telling about Kang the Conqueror who is announced as the villain of the next avengers film... this whole Marvel Phase is about Kang ppl. So everything you see & learn about him in this film is extremely insightful going forward.I really hate when people rate movies by comparing them to others. Some rate it lowly cuz they compared to other marvel or sci fi movies, when you should be just judging the film with fresh eyes and not comparing it to any others or else u are just giving an unfair n bias rating.Lastly for the ppl who tried to say this movie isnt creative.. that its been done before.. I challenge u to find everyone another movie that talks about a Quantum Realm & showing the life forms that exist in it thats ruled by an Evil Multiversal travelling Conqueror lmao.",4,13,18Buddha,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur87524412/?ref_=tturv_usr_243_t,21-Apr-23,

It lacked depth, sanity, reason, or logic, all for the sense of bigger and more expensive than the last one stunts and explosions. But it was a hot mess, absolutely and completely. Not even worth going into specifics, it is just very bad. Moronic in fact, with none of the heart of the first or even second one. It felt like watching a bad version of Attack of the Killer Tomatoes, gone crazy. So sad, because I really liked the first one.

While the Journey was fun in a guilty pleasure kind of way, this movie just puts you to sleep. I am so glad that I skipped it in the theater. If this is the way marvel movies are heading now, I will skip any future releases as well. Thor Love an Thunder looked horrible, this does as well. The only redeeming quality was Kang, who managed to wake me up in the second half of the movie, though I've heard rumors that due to some allegations Disney and other studios might want to be disassociated with Jonathan Majors for the future. There was little chemistry between the actors, the jokes are flat, the movie looks painfully fake and the third act fight with faceless soldiers against no-name troops is anticlimactic.

This weekend Marvel released its third film on the little hero with a big heart, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. And, child, there is some mania going on here. If you've missed the previous two Ant-Man movies, this edition follows up with Scott Lang (Paul Rudd/Ant-Man) and Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly, The Wasp), along with Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer), as they are forced to explore the Quantum Realm again. This time they find it's not as barren as previously thought, and they end up interacting with strange creatures and embarking on an adventure that goes beyond the limits of what they previously thought was possible. Oh yeah, they run into Kang the Conqueror as well. Let's see how it goes.Needless to say, but I'll say it anyway, this is an MCU movie and it obviously should be viewed on a big screen. How much should we pay for that is the question? Here, we're on the back of two successful movies, even if not primary characters of the MCU. The most successful parts of the movie are the CGI, created characters and general realm. The small package delivers big time with those features. Honestly, if you go to Avatar just for the visuals, Quantamania definitely can can follow suit. We've seen space creatures previously in the MCU but they took it up in imagination for this one.Next to that, you know from the Ant-man genre, they are going to bring the laughs. Here there are definitely a few good laughs, but unfortunately, some moments meant to be laughs just felt corny. Even worse was the fact that they kept harping on one particular joke until the end and it never really worked from the beginning. To this point, I felt the movie lost a bit of its heart or character. It felt more like another MCU-movie instead of an Ant-Man movie. We miss you Michael Pena and TI! Anyway, that issue might also have been due to wrong edits selected or what I felt was a rushed storyline. The movie overall didn't feel rushed but something about the pacing just made it feel thrown together. Was I unprepared or were they? Who knows, but I kept feeling it. Nevertheless, the cast as a whole were very good, even the annoying daughter who unfortunately we're likely to see more of based on the thought of a Young Avengers movie coming to us in the years to come.Long story short, Ant-Man and the The Wasp: Quantamania is a solid and visually stunning movie with a rushed set up that makes the plot a bit average. Viewers will be fully entertained either by action or by the corny comedy but won't be truly wowed by the film compared to other movies in the universe. The MCU is falling victim to the Netflix virus, too much content too soon. The movie is enjoyable, but it felt like it was missing some of the previous movies' heart. Obviously, see this on the big screen at any price, but you'll be glad you saved a few bucks with the matinee.",7,4,Stream2BigScreen_Movie_Reviews,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur14280854/?ref_=tturv_usr_252_t,18-Feb-23,

He is ably supported by the regulars and Katheryn Newton does well taking over the reins as Cassie from Abby Ryder Fortson.On top of this the movie adds Kang the Conqueror as the antagonist. Superb performance by Jonathon Majors, who I first came across in ""Lovecraft Country"". Very good actor indeed.The cast is littered with other very notable performances but I'm going to pick out just one and that's Corey Stoll as M. O. D. O. K, or as Scott calls him M. O. D. O. F. K. Bringing Darren Cross in this twist from the comic cannon is well done. It's an excellent performance, especially given the intriguing way the character must have been filmed and produced.I guessed the main plot elements (see second paragraph above) but his didn't spoil the movie one little bit for me.

3,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9130914/?ref_=tturv_perm_257,Ant-hology of ideas that fail to come together.,"Only worth watching once, as far too many Directorial & script errors.It starts out OK-ish but gradually it becomes more & more disjointed.Peyton Reed the Director was another poor choice by Disney to have direct this film as he was unable to bring the poor script together, as so many times scenes needed a more believable reaction from all of the characters in the film. However instead it was a series of incidents where very rarely did the characters react to their environment in a way that any normal human would, as this really takes you out of the film.Jeff Loveness the script writer chosen by Disney executives ( yet another jump on the bandwagon Rick & Morty TV series writer who just joined a successful TV show after it had already become successful ) clearly has no clue how to write for a big budget super hero movie.Why does the Disney executives keep picking the wrong people to direct & write scripts? ( it is like they actually want Marvel to fail ).Stan Lee & Larry Lieber wrote these characters not for children, but as real life characters that had super hero abilities thrust upon them but for some reason Disney think of these characters as ""childish"" so they hire people they think will write for ""children"". When will they realise not only do adults not want to watch movies written specifically for a child but guess what children are not dumb either & they understand a lot more than adults ( such as Disney executives ) give them credit for.Everyone ( children + adults ) want scripts that start of with intrigue, then through a series of events where people act in a logical & more importantly believable way get you to the pay off at the end of the film.The journey should be its own reward, because of what you learn.In this film you learn absolutely nothing of value, as it is pointless.The most important part of any film generally are the story arcs & also the character arcs where the characters actually learn & grow from their experiences along with the audience watching ( whether that be moral lessons or just learning more about the Marvel universe IN A BELIEVABLE WAY for future film interest, however Disney executives choose the wrong directors & even worse the wrong writers so have absolutely destroyed phase 4 as character arcs make little sense ).THIS ANT MAN 3 FILM ( A. M. A. T. W. Q. ) simply needs to be forgotten about as I feel so bad for the actor Jonathan Majors whose character is Kang the Conqueror, as this should have been his huge blockbuster hit. I think he makes a really good Kang & has potential as phase 4 needs to be written off mostly however keep the actors who deserve it. Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly, Michael Douglas & Michelle Pfeiffer are all huge stars ( who have proved many times they are fantastic actors ) so please Disney give them Directors & script writers they deserve who actually understand how a story should develop.The most important thing about any film is the story makes sense, then the story has to be interesting & hopefully it will also give you insight. You let the audience decide what they take from the film themselves.Each character has to act & react to each scene in a believable way or there needs to be dialogue ( or action ) that makes sense to make each scene potentially believable to maintain the audience suspension of disbelief, as they the audience will ride with you & the story telling so long as the writer & director can keep the story in the realms of truth.There was far too many scenes in this poor film where characters did not act in a way which as an audience member you would expect them to do so. This completely takes the audience out of the film & ruins the experience for them, as you can't believe in what you are watching.Kathryn Newton is a young actress with potential who's character Cassie Lang obviously has flaws thinking for example it is OK to go beyond peaceful protesting against the police ( doing their job & following the law ) by moving homeless people on from their choice of living illegally. As it is good the young character wants to live in a better world however harassing the police is not fair as they were doing their job so where is the character arc showing this character progression in this film ( it sends out the wrong message about how to protest as it is not the police's fault & they do not deserve their property vandalised ). At the end of the film Cassie Lang should have realised the police was not in the wrong ( for following the law ) & she should have apologised to the police officers after realising her initial views where far too simplistic & very young child-like ( naive ) in blaming them, as actually homelessness is a much more complex issue & the law keepers actually need better laws to uphold that would help the homeless. Thus she used her power against the wrong people so should learn from that as then we would see her character progression & becoming maturer.Cassie Lang could have made amends & learnt from her immaturity.However unfortunately the script writer was obviously too immature & thinks it is cool to blame the police ( which is not really helping anyone & in fact is putting negative messages out to the audience of this film ).Disney need to hire more intelligent, more mature & better script writers who actually have a social conscience & understand character arcs.( that was just one example where a character could have matured ).Another phase 4 Marvel I will not buy & will pretend was never made.The only reason it got 3 stars was because of the magnificent CGI ( + 1 star from base 1 star = 2 stars ) + ( another 1 star = 3 stars total for the great actors who did their best to save the film. As an awful director & dreadful screen writer ruined a big budget movie with lack of talent.MARVEL FILMS NEED TO BE WRITTEN FOR AN INTELLIGENT AUDIENCE ( as children & adults are mostly intelligent so they will search out the best films with the most intelligent scripts & after they see this Ant Man 3 film they will be put off future Disney productions ).Disney used to stand for quality storytelling, now it stands for lacklustre storytelling so it's time Disney fire the people responsible for hiring these dreadful directors & abysmal screen writers to rebuild Disney.",2,1,Web_Of_Doom,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur119169565/?ref_=tturv_usr_257_t,18-Jun-23,

Okay, then show that or leave it for a Disney plus special, but as a Marvel fan, I expected more for the big stage.Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantummainia doesn't find its tone or establish any conquered aspects that allow it to stand out. The movie felt less about ant man. There wasn't much comical appeal compared to the first one; they tired with Modok's huge face and some jokes about sexual creature experience, there's no love aspect, just set up, and I'm not convinced nor intrigued by what's presented.The possibility of Kang is promising, although why watch a movie for a promising for the future? For such a dynamic antagonist, it could've done more. The power on display was one of my favorite parts, but there wasn't enough action. Ant-man attempts to introduce us to a new world in the quantum verse, but it doesn't stick; it's so outrageous that it isn't relatable and somewhat illogical.Verdict: Ultimately this movie disappoints and gives us the same quality of marvel films we've been accustomed to since the new phase. Marvel needs a blockbuster quick; it needs to establish its tone bc these lackluster films don't meet standards.I rate it 5/10.Grade : D +

5,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8878741/?ref_=tturv_perm_262,Overblown and overcooked despite Paul Rudd's best efforts,"One of the things I enjoyed about the first film was that it was something a bit different from Marvel. It was a low key film with a neat script and doses of comedy that was a nice distraction and pretty much unconnected from the more po-faced world of the Avengers films. Unfortunately though something seems to have gone wrong here.Firstly we have a story that is a partial rehash of other more recent MCU storylines (baddie wants to be an all conquering god-like presence by destroying anyone who stands in his way). Secondly the actor playing that baddie just seems like a wrong bit of casting as. Jonathan Majors (as Kang) seems to lack much gravitas. I'm afraid I found Majors turn in the role a bit hammy too, being unconvincing and far too two dimensional.I also found the film was cherry picking ideas out of other MCU films like GOTG ( races of weird looking aliens) for one. The story lacks originality, reminding me of Avatar, and the script full of obvious cliches. And both these points in mind I think that, after the last Thor film, Marvel is running out of ideas and its becoming obvious.Whilst it's great having older actors like Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfeiffer in these movies, there were times they genuinely seemed embarrassed when they delivered their dialogue. Also the film badly overuses green screen and at times it started to resemble the Star Wars prequels of 20 years ago, with massive CGI battles providing the 'spectacle'.I'm sorry Marvel/Disney but you will have to do better than this sloppy mess Having a charming leas actor just isn't enough to save a film. You have to bring something original to the table too. I thought the recent Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness had it's issues but there was enough originality and novel ideas from Sam Raimi in it to keep it interesting. The same goes for Spider-Man-No Way Home, an overlong film but made watchable by a good story and enough crowd pleasing surprises and to keep it interesting. And whilst Ant-Man doesn't have that legacy, I still think the makers could have done better here.To summarise I found this to be an empty film. It has nothing new to add and feels bloated despite it being one of the shorter Marvel movies. If they had kept the story from getting overblown like this it might have stopped it resembling a dozen other movies. Marvel have had a few critical duds of recent and badly need to rethink their plan if they want to keep their loyal audience from losing interest. If I'm honest, the only film on their slate that I'm genuinely looking forward to at the moment is Deadpook 3.",3,5,trevorwomble,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1967931/?ref_=tturv_usr_262_t,18-Feb-23,

But it's impossible to completely cut yourself off from those in the modern era of social media. I seldom form an opinion about a piece before watching it. However, due to the current environment of unavoidable media and data overload, a first impression is frequently formed even before viewing a film. So, when I initially saw Ant-Man 3, I thought it was a horrible trainwreck with very few redeeming qualities, especially the VFX, which is utterly atrocious and intolerably poor.And now that I have watched the film, I am disappointed, not with the film but with my first impression because I had a blast with this film. In no way is this film great, and it isn't aiming for that either. It succeeds in what it's trying to achieve. The visuals are bad in some portions and great in some, actually, it's a mixed bag of sorts but the visual design is really interesting. There are some cool trippy moments conveyed through stunning visuals and I seriously don't understand what's the fuss all about its VFX. The one-liners don't always land but when they do, they are incredible. I am not saying that people who hated it are wrong, I am just saying that it's unnecessarily vilified. I loved it because it was entertaining and that's what I want from my movies, especially from Marvel.

Quantumania is REALLY bad. The writing, the directing, the visuals, and the performances all range from mediocre to straight up awful.The entire quantum realm (or world, whatever) reminds us of the Star Wars franchise in some ways, but is ugly. It is sanitized and modified to be consistent with the MCU aesthetic for space and multiverses (Doctor Strange, Loki, and Guardians etc). It feels like we are supposed to be wowed by everything, but it is just worse, corporate-made, soulless, AI-generated versions of what we all saw before. From the creatures to landscape to overall colors and visual aura. Is it too much to ask for some new, different visual takes on MCU? Comparing this to The Way of Water which came out just 2 months ago, you can really feel that less care and precision is taken care into each MCU movie.The 2nd half of the movie, while didn't fix every single problem I had, was entertaining to watch. The stakes are there unlike the first half, more interesting stuff to grab your attention, and the final battle is mix between Star Wars prequels and Aquaman with the Ant-Man characters. Even though I did have *some* fun with this, I cannot help but think why can't we have movies that are fun from beginning to end. CBMs like The Suicide Squad or The Batman. Doctor Strange 2 had way more interesting directing choices than this. Why can't the biggest film franchise in the world have more soul and artistry? Movies like Eternals and MoM were criticized a lot but I'd rather have those movies over something like this.I'm really struggling to give this one a rating. It is a mixed bag, there are so many aspects that bother me giving a positive rating, but then I remember having fun. Maybe some time passes, those momentary fun will evaporate from my brain and just a bad movie will remain in my memory. The comedy didn't really land, none of the performances were outstanding besides Jonathan Majors, this really is another MCU product. But a worse one than usual. Hell, I forgot to mention how this is basically another 'setup' movie. No significant character arc or consequences and the ending is just another return to the status quo. I've been a casual MCU fan that watches their movies when they come out and have some fun, but lately the decline in quality & my investment and enthusiasm is Very noticeable. I really feel like James Gunn's DCU will surpass MCU in 2020s if this trend continues.Maybe I'm being too harsh, again, since I did have some fun, but this is my review.",1,3,imxhill,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur119341314/?ref_=tturv_usr_267_t,16-Feb-23,

But this exceptional and awesome weapon might have run out of freshness, which led to the film focusing more on replicating various human dilemmas in the so-called quantum world.

I've read all the reviews and seen several YouTube videos bashing this movie, so I was not expecting much. Despite this, I was still quite entertained.Scott Lang is living his best life with his girlfriend, Hope, his daughter, Cassie, and father- and mother-in-law , Hank and Janet. Then his daughter inadvertently opens a portal to the quantum realm and all five are sucked into it. They find a realm that is teeming with an entire universe inhabited by diverse characters, including a cameoed Bill Murray. The inhabitants are fighting against a dictator, Kang, who wants to leave the quantum realm and take over our universe.This has all been done before, for better or worse, by Star Wars. Some of the characters are interesting and some even have decent scenes, but its a little too much CGI and not enough heart like the other Ant-man movies. That is my biggest issue with this. Ant-man is supposed to kind of palate cleanser for the darker elements of the MCU, but its darker than the previous two movies and it doesn't really feel like an Ant-man movie. There is a serious element of girl-power as well, but its done properly and feels organic, not forced, which was refreshing.This is a visually stunning movie and Kang is a decent villain, but he doesn't have the same menace as Thanos.

But it does succeed at being an entertaining watch in a couple of ways.Kang is the obvious highlight. Everyone knows it. The acting performance was amazing. He was intimidating and interesting. He was a scene stealer and is completely worth seeing the movie for. My only complaint is that the movie made him an Ant-Man level threat instead of an avenger level threat, which seems strange and unrealistic.Other strengths include good visuals, little bits of typical MCU humor (that don't undermine the kang threat imo) which occasionally made me smile and some enjoyable but basic character development between Ant-Man and his daughter.It's not the best or worst marvel movie.

For the most part it just felt like going through the motions of a Superhero movie. They also set up a torch-pass for Kathryn Newton to take over as some form of Ant person. The weird ""activism"" theme they put into the movie was so half-hearted and lame, it gave me douche-chills.MODOK was wasted because the writers don't have respect for the material. The reason he works in the comics is because he's (mostly) written seriously even though he's a ridiculous character. The writers just threw him in there as a joke, and not a good one.Jonathan Majors portrayal of Kang doesn't feel like someone who's familiar with the character, he came off very ""villain of the week"". Really they shouldn't even be showing Kang's face yet, the way he's written would be an obvious setup for something called a ""reveal"", but only good filmmakers know what that is. And REALLY Kang shouldn't come before the Fantastic Four are introduced, but that's just logic at play.Looked like Billy Murray's agent pulled some strings, tried to get him the ""Jeff Goldblum treatment"", and it was just pointless. He was there for 3 minutes, there was nothing funny, and then he was gone. The whole cameo boiled down to ""hey look there's Bill Murray"".Paul Rudd is good, but he looks like he's getting sick of being Ant-Man, which is why they set up the torch pass. Wouldn't be surprised if they give him and Evangeline Lilly a heroic death as an exit, she was almost total set dressing in this movie.Pfeiffer seems to enjoy being in these movies, Michael Douglas just seems happy to be relevant. They're a couple of professionals doing their job.Newton was fine. She needs to get a little more comfortable with green-screen acting, but she'll get there.The digital sweatshop must have worked overtime because it was a CGI spectacle. Pretty much all of the praise I have for this movie goes to the effects department, because it looked great. I like that sort of dirty, fleshy, pinkish coloration. For some reason it worked.4/10.

Paul and Evangeline still have great chemistry in the MCU. Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfeiffer also have chemistry together. Kathryn Newton is fresh to the MCU and her character of Cassie Lang is awesome. I did see Kathryn in Pokémon Detective Pikachu. Jonathan Majors is a really great actor and he is the perfect man to play Kang the Conqueror. Jonathan's character is more intimidating than Tom Hiddleston and Josh Brolin. Jonathan really stole the entire movie. I've waited to see Kang the Conqueror and all the Marvel fans cheered for his arrival. I'm looking forward to see Jonathan in the upcoming MCU films in the future. I really want to see Jonathan win an award whether it is from the Oscars, People's Choice Awards, Teen Choice Awards or Kids' Choice Awards.

Well, he failed miserably. Too blinded by the direction that the movie needs to point the MCU in it gets lost in itself with a messy plot and uninspired mediocre direction. The movie was Sold in the trailers as a qauntum realm hiest for scott to try and complete for his rewards to more time with his daughter. Well i'd like to see that movie because this is not it. Instead we get a tiny hiest that lasts 5 minutes and an awful tory about a rebellion full of characters no one could care less about. Kang makes for an intresting villain and is one of the stronger mcu villians but he is ultimately undermined by the story, we keep getting told 'oh he's so evil' but we rarely get to see that side of him. But oh when we do it is this movie at it's best.The script has some very nice lines and floats out some nice ideas however, the script as a whole is just awful. It's either expostion or messy one liners or just Cassie saying 'dad' in a monotone voice with no facial expression. None of the characters have an arc none of them get any real development, there are hints of Scott having a possible arc but we never see it. Instead character development is erased in service of the plot, but the plot is so messy that it doesn't help. The movie lacks a general structure it feels like so much has happened, but nothing has happened. In addition by the time the movie ended i just struggled to see the point. If marvel wanted to spend a whole moive setting up Kang as the next big bad atleast have the story be good, atleast make us as the audience invested. Kang is meant to be our next big bad but not once did i fear for our heroes.The direction as a whole is a mixed bag Reed delivers some nice shots but overall there are alot of shots that are just awful. Some moments were so badly directed I couldn't tell what I was looking at and not in a good way. I know the qauntum real is difficult to pull off in live action but the CGI was so obvious at points that the movie felt like it was being directed by VFX artists. When you look at 2022's mcu movies despite their issues they all visually had something going for them, this does not. Furthermore, the movies action is lacking i can't think of any memorable action peices in the movie they're all over before they can even begin.The cast for the most part were brilliant especially Majors and Pfieffer. Newton is the weakest link in this cast but the script and direction don't do her any favours so I can't fully judge them.I did enjoy the opening of the movie and i thought it was nice just see Scott Lang being Scott Lang and seeing his life post avengers. Then when we fully got to see Kang introduced and have his first interactions with Scott I really love but after 20 minutes it all fell apart.",3,4,harry-34518,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur104275634/?ref_=tturv_usr_284_t,19-Feb-23,

While the film delivers on the expected humor and lightheartedness that made the first installment enjoyable, it struggles to find a balance between its comedic tone and the weightier elements introduced in the story.Paul Rudd once again charms as Scott Lang, bringing his trademark wit and charisma to the role. His chemistry with Evangeline Lilly, who portrays Hope Van Dyne/The Wasp, is a highlight, and their banter and teamwork provide some of the film's most enjoyable moments. The addition of new characters, such as Jonathan Majors as Kang the Conqueror, brings a refreshing dynamic to the narrative and promises exciting future developments in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.The action sequences in ""Quantomania"" are visually captivating and creatively executed, showcasing the innovative use of size manipulation that defines the Ant-Man franchise. From giant ants to microscopic adventures, the film offers plenty of fun and inventive set pieces that will leave fans entertained. Director Peyton Reed manages to maintain a light and playful atmosphere throughout, reminiscent of a heist film infused with superhero elements.However, the film's main drawback lies in its uneven pacing and disjointed storytelling. At times, the plot feels overstuffed with multiple subplots and character arcs vying for attention. This results in certain storylines being underdeveloped and characters receiving limited screen time, leaving the audience wanting more depth and exploration. Additionally, the film occasionally loses focus and struggles to find a cohesive narrative thread, making it feel like a collection of individual scenes rather than a seamless whole.Furthermore, while the humor is a trademark of the Ant-Man films, ""Quantomania"" leans heavily on comedic moments, sometimes at the expense of emotional resonance. The lighthearted tone undermines the weightier themes introduced, diluting their impact and leaving some moments feeling tonally inconsistent. The film could have benefited from a stronger balance between humor and the deeper emotional beats.On a positive note, the film's visual effects and production design are impressive, capturing the intricate details of the micro and macro worlds with precision. The attention to detail in creating the unique environments and the seamless integration of the CGI elements elevate the overall viewing experience.In conclusion, ""Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantomania"" is a mixed bag. While it delivers the expected humor, entertaining action sequences, and charismatic performances, it falls short in terms of pacing, narrative cohesion, and emotional depth. Marvel fans will likely find enjoyment in revisiting the lovable world of Ant-Man, but those seeking a more well-rounded and impactful superhero experience may be left wanting.",0,2,arsalanweb,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur44739822/?ref_=tturv_usr_287_t,17-Jun-23,

5,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9372612/?ref_=tturv_perm_291,Equally terrible and amazing Ant-Man movie,"Marking the beginning of Marvel Studios' Phase V, Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania aims to end the Ant-Man trilogy on a high note while formally introducing us to new Avengers antagonist Kang the Conqueror, played by Jonathan Majors.This is, without a doubt, one of Marvel's most ambitious projects to date as most of it is set not in a parallel dimension or even in space but in the equally vast Quantum Realm: a very tiny universe where pretty much anything could exist or happen. And a lot of it does here. The creativity involved in bringing this fantasy world to life is genuinely impressive as it delivers the right amount of flashy, surreal visuals and bizarre characters. Director Peyton Reed understood that this Quantum Realm had to feel like nothing else in the MCU and his mission is somewhat accomplished.Unfortunately, this universe has the bad luck of feeling rather similar to the ""space between universes"" we saw recently in Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness, especially since it also involves a bunch of confused actors running on treadmills in front of green screens, which appears to be the norm now over at Marvel headquarters. They throw a bit of wind in there, to make it feel like something, but these are hollow, textureless places you never believe for one second.This third Ant-Man movie is a perfect example of everything that's charming yet also disappointing about the Marvel Cinematic Universe. For all the inventive stuff you see in this film, there's just as many things that take you out of the experience entirely. The cast, for one, mostly seems lost in this wild and wacky story. Framing the film in a tongue-in-cheek way with Paul Rudd's hero flat-out claiming his life ""makes no sense"", thereby warning you about what's to come, was a good move as it assures us that the film is in on the joke. However, the tonal shifts throughout the film both underlines its comedic framing and clumsily bumps headfirst against it.Paul Rudd, when he's given a chance to let loose and troll the film a little bit, looks like he's having a great time. But as Ant-Man he is criminally bland. Rudd ends up feeling miscast as a character that badly needed to be fleshed-out since his first film but wasn't. I want to like and ""get"" Scott Lang but he is such a void that all I end up seeing is a very uncomfortable Paul Rudd who wishes he was literally anywhere else but is doing his best regardless. In fact, everyone in this film does try very hard, I'll give them credit. As Lang's daughter Cassie, Kathryn Newton has a big role and, despite the often dire lines she's given to work with, she tries to deliver each of them with the earnestness and energy needed. Same goes for Jonathan Majors.Majors clearly worked hard on trying to give this bad guy role a bit more weight and eccentricity - something to make Marvel's frankly odd investment in the character feel worthwhile. Yet even his genuine efforts can't make Kang interesting or intimidating in any way. The villain finds himself desperately clawing at every scene he's in in the hope of moving or shocking the audience in some way but he is completely overshadowed by the hilariously misguided yet captivating M. O. D. O. K. (a returning Corey Stoll) who makes his live-action debut here. Obviously, this was always going to be a tough character to make happen convincingly in a film like this but, even though his design is ugly as sin and nowhere near as creepy and repulsive as he could/should have been, he remains a lot of fun and the effect is impossible to look at without smiling.Michelle Pfeiffer, Evangeline Lilly and Michael Douglas seem tragically baffled in this movie as their main contribution involves a lot of exposition spouting and pretending to look around at their green screen surroundings like they're seeing something truly amazing or walking through an Alice In Wonderland-style forest. Everyone's reaction to M. O. D. O. K. Is priceless, however, so they at least nailed this part! Oh, and the less said about Bill Murray's awkward cameo the better - though, admittedly, his exit from the movie is funny.And, really, that's what saves Quantumania: it's funny. A lot of the time on purpose, a lot of the time accidentally. But, you know, sometimes funny is just... funny. And I'll take that over this movie's horrible attempts at conveying real emotions and tackling serious themes while there's a dude with a BROCCOLI HEAD just walking around saying stuff. There's that tone shift again! This is, to be completely honest, one of the most ludicrous films ever made and, for that reason, you gotta watch it. The visuals are a trip, the mess of it all is a beautiful trainwreck, yet it's also actually good sometimes: the ""drink the ooze"" sequence is worthy of a Rick & Morty episode, crossed with something Taika Waititi would come up with (which might annoy some viewers further, granted).Like I said: you gotta watch this movie. It set out to be an unapologetically wild experience and it definitely is that. Part-Star Wars spoof, part-Fantastic Voyage, there's still heist stuff in there somehow, the Baskin Robbins guy is back, characters multiply like cells... it is relentlessly ridiculous, occasionally awful/brilliant and, though some will hate it with a passion, some will no doubt appreciate its refusal to make any sense at all for the sake of pure, brainless entertainment.A really fun bit of weirdness.",2,1,TheRetroCritic,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur4027771/?ref_=tturv_usr_291_t,12-Oct-23,

The Quantum universe that this is set in looks more like something from Star Wars. Paul Rudd's Ant-Man spends too much of the film totally uninterested until his daughter is in danger, so hardly what you expect from an Avenger. I don't know who is writing for Marvel at the moment, but I think Stan would be turning in his grave at how poor Phase 4 has been.

However, while ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" offers moments of brilliance, it fails to escape the criticisms that accompany it. One of the film's strengths is certainly the construction of the creative world of the quantum realm, a place full of strange creatures and surreal scenarios that captivate the viewer's imagination. Jonathan Majors shines in the role of the villain Kang the Conqueror, adding depth and menace to the story. However, despite these positive elements, the film fails to maintain a consistent pace. One of the main criticisms of the film lies in the possible fatigue of the superhero genre, reflected in a lack of enthusiasm in the main characters. Evangeline Lilly and Kathryn Newton fail to shine in their roles, while Peyton Reed's direction seems to lack the same enthusiasm as the previous chapters of the series. Furthermore, the film's plot becomes predictable in its second half, losing coherence in the characters and Kang's characterization. The lack of originality and excessive reliance on digital effects and expanded universe may disappoint some viewers looking for a more solid and engaging story. Despite these criticisms, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" still offers moments of entertainment and visual spectacle, keeping alive curiosity for the future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. However, a change of direction may be necessary to reinvigorate the creative spirit of the series and maintain high audience interest. In conclusion, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" presents itself as an ambitious film that, despite some strengths, fails to escape the criticisms that accompany it. It offers a journey through fantastic worlds and iconic characters, but it may not be enough to fully satisfy the expectations of Marvel Cinematic Universe fans.",0,0,gsilecchia,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur176950876/?ref_=tturv_usr_293_t,15-Apr-24,

There was a certain character epiphany which came far too easily, without substance, or ability to empathize with the character (if you see the movie, you'll know which one I'm talking about). No real character development, or substance. The villain was stereotypical, with uninspired motivations. Only one ""hook"" made it interesting (but that will require other movies to explore)Let's not even get into the potential plot holes or pseudoscience.All in all, it's OK for a pastime movie to shut your brain off for a bit, and to know you've seen all the main Marvel installments.

With Antman and the Wasp: Quantamania, MARVEL starts phase 5 and with much bigger plans ahead. Let me straightway put it out there that the title of this movie is weird and I won't be typing the full name again in this review. Also this doesn't feel much like an 'Antman' movie but it also doesn't feel specifically belonging to any kind of character.This Antman isn't really bad as most of the reviews have described it to be. The movie takes off pretty quickly on its intentions and moving into the quantum world. The how's and why's the characters get there is pretty routine MARVEL movie stuff. We get introduced to new bunch of characters in this world and to be honest it kind of feels like those weird characters from most of the Star Wars movies we have seen. Even the humour surrounding them is pretty similar. As mentioned by almost everyone the movie does pick up with the introduction of Kang The Conquerer. It doesn't come as a surprise to me especially considering how his role was put out at the end of Loki even it was for a very short duration. Jonathan Majors makes immediate impact and takes over the movie. Then its all about how the Antman family battles Kang in the quantum realm and what may be coming in the future. However all that's done in not such a convincing manner. Having said that, the movie isn't really boring but it doesn't also connect emotionally as much. The action sequences are nothing much new but some of the visual effects are pretty good which remind of Multiverse of Madness. There is barely any real world scenes in the movie and this will be a difficult watch in anywhere but IMAX.Paul Rudd does a decent job but doesn't really get much to explore the funny and witty side of character. Evangeline lily and Michael Douglas are just the passengers. Michelle Pfeiffer comparatively has a key role but it isn't an impactful one. However, it is all Jonathan Majors as Kang the Conquerer who plays an immense and intense role who keeps the movie floating. Rest of the side characters doesn't really get much to do.

Something to Watch.,"Reel Tunez Movie Review (2/17/23): ""Ant Man and the Wasp: Quantumania""Have to say it certainly wasn't the best of the Ant Man movies. Nearly the entire thing was done with digital backgrounds and effects, and some looked pretty rushed and not ""convincing"" (at least for the ability of digital technology). The story line was fair, and seeing Bill Murray is always cool (though very short). Evangeline Lilly is an actress I enjoy seeing and think she's great, so that certainly helped the movie. But it just lacked the ""pizazz"" of the typical well-done Marvel action/adventure. I love to promote seeing movies AT the theaters because they should be a special experience, but the effects and digital animation may be more convincing on a big TV. It's another Marvel movie, so remember to stay until the very very end so you can see the extra stuff (one during credits and one after).On a 1-10 scale, I'd give it a 5.6. Remember that my scale is tough (unlike others who seem to think a mediocre movie is a 7, and an okay movie is an 8). Above a 5 is something I consider worth seeing (you won't wish for the two hours of your life back), and 4.9 and under is a ""regret"".

Would rate it either a 7/10 possibly 6/10 due to some questionable choices in pacing, comedy and it's Villain. By no means was Kang Terrible, as Jonathan Majors performance as him was one of the highlights of the film, he is a great actor and will be interesting to see more of him. ""He who remains"" wasn't a good showing. But the film somewhat has inconsistent tonal shifts and pacing of the movie from being somewhat slow at the start, to fast in the middle and rushed high octane towards the end. Also the lack of supporting characters mostly Janet, hurts this movie.The comedy didn't hit for me asides from a few jokes directed at a specific character but some of the dialogue and interactions between characters felt forced. The new characters felt like I've seen them before due to the marvel formula, asides from Jentorra, but even she is debatable I liked her character/actress and Cassie as she has potential to grow but she was annoying at times in the movie but as a ""Young Avenger"" the potential is there.The CGI and VFX Effects weren't as Laughable or down right terrible as people had described as any Marvel movie they were good in some scenes yes they weren't the best with a certain character the element of realism had already gone out the window. Some scenery and environments whilst in the quantum realm looked highly detailed and immersive. The overall set pieces/ships did provide a Star Wars vibe, which isn't a bad thing.This film yet again proves that knowledge of the TV shows is starting to be required just like Dr Strange and The Multiverse Of Madness having watched WandaVision helped my understanding of the topics with Ant Man 3 watching Loki does better the overall viewer experience but enough explanation is provided in the film to make it watchable for newcomers even still there is a reliance on the viewer having watched or is caught up with Loki which knocks off a point.Overall, Its a good watch with a friend or someone who likes the MCU's Ant-Man and its movies as this lays the foundation of the Big Bad to be Kang and his plans to conqure. It has some emotional heartfelt moments, engaging performances, high stakes and seemingly lasting consequences it's still fresh so my opinion may change but its between a 6 or 7 out of 10.",3,3,adamsmith-51004,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur61456303/?ref_=tturv_usr_298_t,26-Mar-23,

This has a positive and negative impact on the film.Kang is easily the best part of the film. He is played excellently by Jonathan Majors and for the most part, has a great on screen presence. He's by far the most menacing villain we've seen in the Ant-Man series and pretty much carries the film alongside Ant-Man.We also get to explore the Quantum realm which looks unique when compared to most other marvel properties. There was a lot about it that felt like Star Wars. For the most part the CGI in the Quantum realm looked really good but one of the sub villains is by far the worst CGI character Marvel has ever created. It was legitimately off putting.There was also a lot of exposition to try and fill us in on what happened off screen to tie the Ant-Fam and Kang worlds together. It felt like I was listening to an audio book and the explanations weren't always well thought out. Not to mention, we get another Marvel child genius pop out of nowhere.Quantumania was an average entry into the MCU. It's not as bad as some critics have suggested but not enough to get you really excited for Phase 5.

The way Hope shines alongside him as they fight together really shows how much a heroine she is, even though the original Wasp gets more fleshed-out here than she (which is fine, because it was Janet's turn for that). And in all his interaction with Cassie, the love feels real, the frustration feels real, and the camaraderie is 100% consistent with where her character was when she was young. I'm amazed at how much attention was paid to dramatic detail and character-arc continuity. (Some recent MCU releases have lacked in those areas.)Also, I genuinely appreciated that Scott didn't fully learn the lesson Cassie sought to instill in him (caring about the plight of strangers just as much as family members), so this leaves room for his character arc. I'm glad it wasn't instant-morality-learned-in-a-snap. And in subtle ways, she also saw that her naïveté lacked wisdom and planning. She had a lot of heart, but needed practicality. Again, room for character growth, and it was beautiful to see so much of that explored in an action film.And there were some other things left open, that I won't get into here, so I'll just say how much I appreciated that. Too many superhero movies wrap everything up in a nice little bow by the end.Finally, I loved how the movie didn't get bogged down in attempts at humor. To me it was just the right amount, and almost always felt natural.

The big key there was good writing, action sequences and introducing Michelle Pfieffer as Janet Van Dyne a role which proved a good fit for her.Adding in Bill Murray to this installment as well as my admiration for the other two films left me very excited for part 3.However it was also somewhat concerning that they were releasing it so early in the year in February as the previous films were both summer blockbusters.Granted Hollywood has taken the traditional dump months of January and February in the last decade and released some good if not great films (Black Panther the original was a good example of this) so it wasn't a huge concern but did seem rather odd they didn't release it in July as Ant Man seems more like a summer type of movie anyways.Then the reviews came in. Critics can be wrong but I have found if the reviews are bad for a Marvel movie then they are usually spot on.Good examples of this were Eternals which was trash in my opinion and the critics were right in saying so, and the most recent Thor putting recieved mixed reviews and as a result was just very average.The good news is the movie could have been worse the bad news is it's barely any better than Eternals which was horrible.The story just doesn't have enough action and is way too slow and while Majors an slang, Newton as Cassie and Murray as Krylar give their very best in their roles, Rudd, Lilly, Pfieffer and Douglas all seem less energetic than usual and don't even look like they are having a good time and share the audiences sympathy that they are just as tired of this series as we now are.Murray's cameo was a standout but he's barely in the movie and unless he had an expanded role it's a waste of his talent.The pacing is also very sluggish which really hurts the movie even more compared to its predecessors and other Marvel entries.Hollywood needs to remember why we fell in love with these movies and stick to the formula that makes them good.Being mildly disappointed with Thor 4 and very disappointed with this and Eternals I'm concerned Marvel is running out of gas a lot and they need to have a lot fresher material if they are going to continue with more sequels.Not the worst movie but a tremendous disappointment. I not only recommend you skip seeing it in theaters but I wouldn't recommend even streaming it on Disney Plus when it comes out to streaming.Stream the first two films again and save your time and money by skipping this one.I know it's already a big hit but this is a huge step down in the good quality Marvel has offered us before.",2,4,spencer-w-hensley,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur47032916/?ref_=tturv_usr_303_t,23-Feb-23,

Some of the attempted comedy is embarrassing. The action is too CGI-ish and lacks substance, with battles looking exactly like a cheap-and-nasty CGI battles.And then there's the storyline; ho-hum.

The multiverse of ""madness"" turned out to be the universe of ""quite similar but the traffic lights are upside down"" and here the unknowable quantum realm, where physics and time don't exist in any way we understand, is just another alien world.To be fair, the alien world is a pretty cool one. There are funky creatures and weird characters, giving things a 50's B movie or Flash Gordon vibe, complete with appropriate wacky visuals. Sadly all this stuff is rushed, not really giving the chance to take in the view or enjoy fun moments, including a cameo everyone would surely love to have seen more of. You get the feeling an earlier phase of the MCU would have leaned into the ""Lost in Space"" of it all a bit more but here we have to move quickly on to the Super High Stakes. These involve Jonathon Major's Kang, played in a reserved style that makes him menacing but a little out of sync with the rest of the movie. Given he is from another dimension that may be the point. Kang's sidekick MODOK is a fun take on a ridiculous villian but the departure may divide comic book fans.On the hero front its good to see Michelle Pfeiffer given a substantial role and it looks as if a grown up Cassie Lang is intented to be a fixture going forward but Evangeline Lilly has such a reduced role it seems pointless keeping ""The Wasp"" as part of the title. Micheal Douglas is enjoyable when on screen but kept mostly to the periphery of proceedings and while he is having fun you can tell he isn't exactly massively invested in whats going on. Leading man Paul Rudd is, well, Paul Rudd. He brings the charm and liability to Scott Lang you've come to expect. He manages this despite being stuck with a pretty stupid character arc where he begins the film suddenly averse to helping people for no well defined reason.This is symptomatic of some fairly lazy writting in parts, with some of the most by the numbers dialogue yet seen in a Marvel movie. Fortunately there is enough visual and stylistic creativity on display to make the film more than watchable, if certainly no Giant Man of the genre.7 hyper intelligent insects out of 10 ants.",5,3,danchilton-71955,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur68828911/?ref_=tturv_usr_314_t,23-Feb-23,

He gets plentiful screen time, especially from the midpoint on, and proceeds to steal every scene while single-handedly raising the stature of the film. Some other positives include a fast-moving pace, a solid amount of quirky comedy, and a smidge of self-awareness, though some of Disney's recent fallbacks still lingered, like the cheesy dialogue and insincere drama.

6,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8886212/?ref_=tturv_perm_320,Lacks the magic of its predecessors,"Everything is going great in Scott Lang's world. He's a successful author, he has his relationship with Hope van Dyne, and his bond with his daughter couldn't be stonger. All that changes when the three of them, along with Janet Van Dyne and Hank Pym, are transported to the Quantum Realm, taking them on an adventure that has them facing off against their most dangerous opponet yet.With Quantumania, Peyton Reed is the second MCU director to take a character through a full trilogy. With Ant-Man, Reed and his team crafted a simple heist film, a construct that worked famously within the confined of the shared universe. Ant-Man and The Wasp expanded the scope of Scott's world, giving viewers a Ferris Bueller-style adventure comedy focused on rescuing Janet van Dyne from the Quantum Realm. With Quantumania, the smaller, more character focused storytelling has largely been traded in for a wide ranging, consequence-heavy epic that feels out of step with its previous outings. Gone are the good natured antics and warmth of the X-Con gang, who fail to appear in the movie, replaced instead by an underdeveloped band of freedom fighters. The tone of the Ant-Man franchise, the foolish absurdity that Paul Rudd has made his bread and butter over the decades, quickly dissipates in the film's opening act, replaced by jokes that land at an inconsistent rate and cameos that ultimately amount to nothing.Written by Rick and Morty writer Jeff Loveness, the overall issue with Quantumania lies in the story. If the purpose of the story is to introduce Kang the Conqueror as the next overarching villain of the MCU, the ball was certainly fumbled here. While Kang is undeniably a threat, he doesn't feel like an Avengers-level threat during or after the events of this film. While the post credit scenes do a little to push the narrative, the movie itself fails at establishing Kang as a worthy menace, never fully revealing his overall goal outside of escaping the Quantum Realm. The Multiverse Saga was teased and set up throughout Phase 4, doing double duty as something of a dénouement of the Infinity Saga, but after the events of Spider-Man: No Way Home, Loki, and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, audiences were poised to delve fully into the multiverse and Kang's tyrannical reign upon it. Unfortunately, no such thing happens in Quantumania, continuing to leave audiences in the dark about what's coming or anyone's role in it (except Sylvie, her role was very clearly defined). It's this lack of clear definition that may leave some lukewarm on the run up to 2025's Kang Dynasty, a movie that Loveness is also the writer of.Starring Paul Rudd, Quantumania takes the time to explore the relationship between Scott Lang and his daughter Cassie. The overall theme and strongest throughline of the trilogy has been Scott's love for his daughter and this movie continues it; Rudd and Kathryn Newton have excellent chemistry together. Typically the happy-go-lucky Avenger, Rudd is able to expand a bit thanks the more dramatic elements of the film. These scenes Rudd, an actor proven that he can be just as good dramatically as he can comedically, handles with ease.The story's decision to fixate on Scott and Cassie's relationship comes at the detriment of almost every other character on screen, save Kang. Hank Pym, once again played beautifully by the seemingly perennially cantankerous Michael Douglas, has woefully little to do in this film, relegated to the background throughout the majority of the runtime. The same can be said for Evangeline Lilly as The Wasp, hanging back and serving little purpose other than to ask the questions the audience is already thinking. While the relationship between Lang and Hope van Dyne was fractured between the first two Ant-Man movies, time has managed to heal all wounds between the two here. Rudd and Lilly are always great together, with Lilly's no-nonsense nature counterbalancing Rudd's goofiness perfectly. With Quantumania, however, audiences don't get much interaction between the characters. Lilly is fine in the role, but sadly, is given little to do outside of one major scene.Michelle Pfiffer, bascially teased in the last minutes of Ant-Man and The Wasp, comes to forefront here in Quantumania as the audience's guide through the strange world. Pfiffer carries weight in the movie as Janet van Dyne navigates the heroes through the terrain while providing the necessary back story on Kang. Her agency in the movie cannot be denied, and while she takes a step back later in the film as Kang and Lang square off, she dominates the first half.Jonathan Majors is Kang. A complete 180 turnaround from the character he played in the last episode of Loki, this iteration of the character is as ruthless as he is cunning. Physically, Majors takes up space on the screen, and while he's roughly the same height as Rudd, it's Majors' presence that makes him seem larger than he is. The first of two antagonistic roles this year, Quantumania shows that while he's up to the task, the script and story don't rise to his skillset. Majors is fascinating on the screen; Kang the Conqueror doesn't fully reach the expectations levied upon him by producer Kevin Feige.The most disappointing element of the film is M. O. D. O. K. While impressive visually, and voice acted well enough by Ant-Man returnee Corey Stoll, the arc that began for Darren Cross in the first movie sees a limp and unsatisfying conclusion here. Sprinkled throughout the film generously, a lot of the jokes designed for or surrounding him fall flat in way that can't help but be reminiscent of Thor: Love and Thunder.Peyton Reed's ambition has to be admired. With some of the best visual effects since the MCU has entered the Multiverse Saga, Quantumania is a sight to behold. From the moment the characters enter the Quantum Realm, the background of almost any scene seems to be something pulled from Reed's fever dreams. While that doesn't always work in the film's favor (the actors rarely interact with the background, at times leaving a clear visual impression of two people standing in front of a screen), the praised must be heaped on the visual effects team. The trip to the Quantum Realm, the Mos Eisley cantina-esque scene, and the bevy of creatures found inhabiting the land have many comparing the movie to Star Wars, and rightfully so. It can't go overlooked that Reed unabashedly loves the Fantastic Four and actively worked on a film treatment long ago; there's scenes and ideas throughout that nod to his love of wacky space adventures. While the film's pacing is problematic, especially in its shaky first act, once Kang is finally introduced, the storytelling settles into its pace. Once established, the second act shines as the film's highlight, giving the story the feel of Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, painting parts of the Quantum Realm as a desolate wasteland completely unlike what was shown near the end of Ant-Man and The Wasp. The third act, the weakest of the trilogy, enters absurd territory as Scott fights to stop Kang from enacting his nefarious scheme.Overall, Quantumania, while still entertaining at times, lacks the magic of its predecessors. The original spirit of the characters, the charm of Paul Rudd, and the low stakes of the Ant-Man franchise are absent, leaving viewers with a bleaker tone and a lack of goofy charisma they've come to expect. While Peyton Reed is still taking ambitious swings, a number of ideas don't fully connect, leaving the audience with a story that doesn't fully lives up to its potential. Rudd continues to be delightful, Jonathan Majors is appropriately menacing, and Kathryn Newton is a great addition, making the outcome of this project all the more baffling. Worth seeing on the biggest possible screen thanks to some of the great visual effects, Quantumania may have some viewers continuing to question the overall quality of the post-Endgame world we live in.",2,4,dmansel,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur123353548/?ref_=tturv_usr_320_t,22-Feb-23,

It also set to have Kang the Conqueror who was depicted to make Thanos look like a walk in the park. Marvel really puffed up what this movie was going to be, and it did not deliver.Before reading any further, if you are a die hard MCU fan, then you will most likely disagree with my rating and review of this movie. That is okay.About 90% of the movie takes place in the Quantum Realm, but it did not introduce anything new about it. It lacked any depth into strengthening its value and place in the MCU. It just seemed like if Ant Man and the rest of the main cast were fighting on one of the distant planets in Star Wars; it was just there with no build to the greater hierarchy.The dynamic between Cassie Lang and her father, Scott Lang/Ant Man, was absolute garbage. If you rewind the clock, Ant Man was stuck in the Quantum Realm back when Thanos snapped his finger. He was gone for five years before luckily escaping, and that was lost time he could have had with his daughter. When they reunited, it was heart felt and full of emotion. That was the last of seeing their relationship. Then now Cassie had so much resentment towards her father, and it went unexplained. What happened from then to now?Kang's character was a joke. He was not the threat marketing/advertising made him to be. He lacked conviction, and he lacked that villain presence that fuels fear. Even at the end of the movie, Ant Man himself was reflecting on their battle, and he literally brushed it off his shoulder like one would after tripping and falling then just simply picking yourself back up.If anything, the end credit scene is what really setup for the future of the MCU. Honestly, it felt like what Dwayne Johnson did with Black Adam's end credit scene where he had Henry Cavill return for a Superman cameo. What is the point of that?

Acting 10/10Overall 8/10This movie seems to snowball from strength to strength with a simple story that gradually grows into something bigger than this one event within the Marvel universe (Excuse the pun).Action which at first feels familiar but surprises with each offensive manouvre given the technology available to each side. Including one on ones, skirmishes and a siege scene.But the most impressive part by far is the main antagonist. I look forward to what personalities he brings to the sequels that he is apart of. His acting chops are level 100!Now, please excuse me while I do some research to understand who this character is within the comic universe...",5,3,TheDestroia,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur99064099/?ref_=tturv_usr_327_t,6-Mar-23,
7,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8881358/?ref_=tturv_perm_328,Good MCU Film,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is pretty good with its scenes, action, the story. The story has to do with the family of Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), Hope (Evangeline Lilly), Cassie (Kathryn Newton), Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer), and Hank (Micheal Douglas) all being sent to the quantum realm and want to go back home safe and sound. Although, they meet obstacles along the way of the civilization of the Quantum Realm, M. O. D. O. K (Machine only designed only for Killing), and Kang the Conqueror in the way. Ant-Man must do what is best for his family and fight whatever is in his way to go back home. Overall, I thought it was a good MCU film because I liked the acting and story. Some stuff that I did not like is that that the film is mainly dialogue and setup for the next MCU films coming up. It was not the best MCU film out of all of them or great, but it is good for a single viewing in theaters in my opinion.",31,37,demonblade-37792,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur140486858/?ref_=tturv_usr_328_t,19-Feb-23,

Unfortunately, it stuck to the same cookie-cutter format that the MCU has been relying on, post EndgameI guess that could be considered good or bad news, depending on what you like to see. But I will say this, watching MCU movies as of late is like eating pizza everyday for, like, a couple of weeks straight. Love pizza, but too much of a good thing is never a good thing. I'm still waiting for something in these new Phases of the MCU to move me like I was moved in the early years of the MCU. Sadly, AMWQ doesn't do anything for me.I still don't know why Infinity War and Endgame seemed so damned good. I guess Infinity War and, to an extent, Endgame had more humanity to it. Those movies had character growth, more emotional interaction, more substance to who the actual players were and how they tied into the plots. Those movies surely had better quality writing, and the acting, as I remember it, was also much better than what I've seen in recent MCU movies. What I've noticed is that the MCU is trading quality scriptwriting for CGI, and the narratives are now focused on female heroes, and genius children/teen, whom also tend to be MENSA level scientist and inventors. I'm not stating that those people don't exists, but it's being overdone, almost forced on us (remember the pizza analogy).Couple this with some very poor writing (the way MODOK was challenged to conversion via a flurry of ""d*ck"" references was disgusting and cheap).So, yeah, Ant-Man/Quantomania is a good enough movie. It was fun to watch, and it will make money. I guess all these MCU movies will make money until they don't...which probably means people are finally getting sick of pizza.6/10 fun, but nothing unique here.",3,4,mistela67,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur22008378/?ref_=tturv_usr_335_t,20-Feb-23,

That being said there are a few marvel films that I do genuinely enjoy like the iron man trilogy and being that Ant Man 3 (don't want to waste characters on the title) was the only new cinema release this week, I decided to give it a go. The third in the Ant Man trilogy, following on from Ant Man and Ant Man and the Wasp sees Scott Lang/Ant Man (Paul Rudd) and his family pulled accidentally into the quantum realm where surprise surprise there's an angry man destroying everything (these worlds need better counsellors) and it's up to Ant Man and co to stop him. The film has a bland plot and an even blander colour palate, most of the film is really dark and then suddenly there will be bursts of light from lasers that to be honest were the only thing keeping me awake for much of the film. The cast are fine, the writing is cookie cutter and generally awful and Jonathan Majors as Kang the ANTagonist seems to be getting heavily praised for his part in this film despite not really doing all that much apart from delivering a lot of trash talk dialogue.Whilst I'm far from a huge marvel fan myself I appreciate that perhaps unfortunately these films are keeping a lot of cinemas open at the moment and so I have to respect them for that, I just wish people were more opened minded to non superhero films. This was a great example of everything I dislike about the mcu, too many of their films rely almost entirely on having recognisable actors to carry along the same old tiresome narratives and I'm over it.",3,4,TomTalksFilms,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur125201937/?ref_=tturv_usr_337_t,18-Feb-23,

4,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8878909/?ref_=tturv_perm_342,Here's a Thought...,"I would like to take a different point of view towards the problems surrounding the new Marvel movies. Here's the thing, I think the main issue that is causing such disappointments for fans regarding the recent movies is not technical. I don't deny the bad CGI or editing and directing problems, but, the big issue is with the overall storytelling. If you take a good look at each phase and each Saga of the MCU you can kinda look at it as a TV show for which each of the phases act as a season and each of the Saga as a whole show. Storytelling is a vital aspect of any good show. In order to create the best villain, you need appropriate and proper build up. The said build up will probably require to include many side stories which seem to be irrelevant but are portrayed in an interesting way for their own sake. Let me clarify. The first Saga of the MCU was the Infinity Saga which included three phases and Thanos was the ultimate vilain for it. If my calculations are correct, the character had his own movie after 18 others. We repeatedly saw traces of the Infinity stones in those movies and as a result they became a great mystery for us and left a mark in our minds. Therefore, when we finally got to know what exactly they were and how the great villain is going to use them and even what the point of all the chaos around them was, our excitement was beyond imagination. Besides that, we got to know our heroes very well on the ride. In the end we knew everything about them and felt everything they felt because of all the adventures we experienced with them. It was the Finale of the show, and boy what a great Finale it was.Now, it's time for the new show. I haven't read the comics but it seems like Kang is going to be the main villain of the multiverse Saga. The character is really interesting in Ant-Man 3 and I think can make a really great villain. BUT, none of the abovementioned features are present in the new Saga. The character is not only introduced in the very first movie of phase five but also is the main focus of the second half of the movie. I don't want to mention his faith in the end but let me just say it was not OK with me especially when the name of The next Avenger movie, which by the way is coming out only two years after this, is Kang Dynasty. The great villain of the new Saga fought only Ant-Man and a couple of not interesting side characters of the Avengers. How can I hope for such villain to grow into one which I respect and fear? The issue with the new Saga is that after each movie, or show, you cannot find a good answer for the question of ""what was the point of the movie?"" I mean one could question the necessity of its existence. Most of the movies and shows are just there to badly introduce new heroes to us. Dont get me wrong this must be done, as it was in the first Saga, but back then the introduction of heroes was not the main focus of each movie. They were introduced and then given a proper villain to fight. And the fights had proper conclusions. Now, for a second, think about doctor strange 2, black panther 2, Ant-Man 3, Thor 4, or any of the shows and see if you can find anything without which the overall story would be hurt. Let me summarize some of the recent projects of MCU for you: ""SPOILER ALERT""Falcon and winter soldier: Falcon is the new captain AmericaMoon knight: there's a new guy with ancient Egyptian powersMs. Marvel: we have a Muslim heroDoctor Starnge 2: America Chavez EntersThor 4: Thor has a kid psychicBlack Panther 2: Shury is the new BP and there's a fish villain in the futureThe point of all of them is telling you there is something great coming and you should feel excited for it. They don't make you feel that way, they tell you to feel that way.The issue of storytelling that Marvel is facing is very complicated and I know I was not able to convey my thoughts about it but I hope you had got the gist. Anyway, I don't think any of the upcoming movies of MCU are going to be an exception of this weakness of storytelling due to their overall relevance and this really pains me that my favorite Cinematic Universe will not make any more good movies for a long time.",4,3,secret_arash,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur114560829/?ref_=tturv_usr_342_t,18-Feb-23,

Also, at times the special effects looked off and fake, but they did look colourful which I liked.

This was seriously a lay-up from having an established franchise that's not half bad in Ant Man and then Loki building up Kang. This was literally bad from the beginning as soon as he picks up his (yet another progressive woke complainer) daughter. And now there's basically an entire Star Wars world that is the Quantum Realm now which also has the original Ant Man villan as M. O. D. O. K, hence my subject line.And then maybe this is just me being stupid but in End Game when Scott Lang is explaining the Quantum Realm and they thought it must have been a hard 5 years and he said that's the thing, it was more like 5 hours. Doing the math, Janet was down there for 30 years but in that world it was 30 hours right?And it's a bummer because in addition to the Ant Man franchise being decent and the build up in Loki, I actually really like Majors in general and think he's a good actor!I don't know how much longer the MCU has got because the good ones still left can't keep bailing out all the bad ones out lately.",1,2,evan_lassi,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur26148035/?ref_=tturv_usr_349_t,27-May-23,

The real problem with this movie are the protagonists and the characters in general not deepened enough and especially that damn M. O. D. O. K. I hope never to see him again. The film starts way too fast, after not even 20 minutes they are already in the quantum realm and it's all extremely too fast.

First off, this isn't a excellent Marvel film, but it's not a terrible one either. This is a average MCU film to kick off Phase 5 of the MCU and honestly will probably only be remembered for being the start of Phase 5. It was great to see Paul Rudd back as Ant-Man, but I feel some of the source material that was given to him wasn't always the best. Evangeline Lilly as the Wasp was great to see again, but I feel like her character was sidelined for a majority of the film including Michael Douglas as Hank Pym. Both characters have their moments throughout the film that I enjoyed though. The standout characters that carry this movie were definitely Michelle Pfeiffer's Janet Van Dyne and Jonathan Majors Kang the Conqueror. I loved every scene these two characters were in together and loved the chemistry between them as well. It left me wanting more of both of them together. I was also glad to get more of a back story of Janet's time in the quantum realm. Jonathan Majors hands down is Kang the Conqueror and gives this movie his best performance he could possibly give with the source material given to him. The only downside I had with his character, is like Paul Rudd's Ant-Man, not all of the source material given to him was always the best and was disappointing sometimes, but Kang the Conqueror was definitely my favorite character of the entire film. One character I thought that was better than I thought would be due to the other actress who played the character in Avengers: Endgame was recast in this movie was Kathryn Newton as Cassie Lang. I came around and really enjoyed her take on the character. I can't wait to see more of her in the future. The last character that I loved in this movie that I was aware of going into this movie, was gonna be either a love or hate character was M. O. D. O. K. And I absolutely loved this character more than I anticipated too. He had some of the best lines in the film and even though his CGI wasn't always the best, Marvel was able to pull off his character introduction better than I thought they would. When it comes to the tone of the movie, I feel like Marvel copied Star Wars way too much when it came to the source material and it didn't always sit right with me. There are also 2 post credit scenes. The first one honestly in my opinion wasn't a fan of, but the second one has me hyped for what's to come in the future. Overall, this film isn't perfect, but the performances given by Jonathan Majors and Michelle Pfeiffer, make this film worth the watch. Rating 7.5/10.",1,1,dakotadickenson-83457,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur161212279/?ref_=tturv_usr_352_t,18-Feb-23,
6,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8891249/?ref_=tturv_perm_353,Another MCU movie that only earns money but fails to deliver story,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is the introduction to phase five of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, in which we are introduced to another realm and a new villain. If you have watched the trailer of Ant-Man, it's basically the first 30 minutes of the movie, and should you expect more from that? No! The movie focused more on proving why Ant-Man deserved to be in the Avengers despite making his character comical and a caricature during the Avengers era. Due to this, Jonathan Major's character, Kang, felt like a weaker version of Thanos even though the movie heavily implied that he was powerful and dangerous because of what he wanted to do.The movie has a very rough and uneven pace. The first act felt bumpy and jagged, but the second act was able to redeem it. One good act can't redeem a film overstuffed with so much story, and many characters, that you'll hope everyone would stall their hackneyed jokes. Since this is an introduction to another adventure for the MCU, we are introduced to so many characters, that resulted in them being underwritten, and some characters from the franchise are underutilized. Evangeline Lilly's character, Hope, was overshadowed by Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer), and I am more invested in Janet's story than Hope's. Bill Murray as Lord Krylar also has a cameo but they wrote his character to be somewhat interesting but was left off, or maybe since this is just an introduction to his character---I don't really know. Corey Stoll as M. O. D. O. K was a fun and weird-looking character as well, but it felt like a one-off that can only be used once. However, I appreciate that they used the same character to play M. O. D. O. K. As it added relevance to the story.In all honesty, it was Paul Rudd's charm and humor that carried the comedy in this film, and this time, his character has more sense and does not feel like a caricature version of Paul Rudd. Unfortunately, lackluster writing and repetitive Marvel clichés did not allow for Rudd's effortless charm to carry the movie. My biggest problem with the film is how they did not fully utilize Kang's story, it was heavily implied in the movie that he was stronger and bigger than most villains in the MCU and it was shown in the movie the danger of what he wanted to do but failed to demonstrate it. By placing an opponent that is nearly godly level, it should feel threatening and terrifying to the point that Ant-Man can't even fight him toe-to-toe, however, the villain looked like on the same level as Thanos' Corvus Glaive.Is Ant-Man 3 worth watching to keep up with Marvel's new phase? Yes! But the movie settled on being ""just okay"" and is primarily stuck on needing to be bigger instead of being amusing, compelling, and unique. Nonetheless, as an introduction to Phase 5, there is much more to wait for and a story to tell, and the Quantumania is a good realm to start.",1,2,jaysonpajaronvistal,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur158145467/?ref_=tturv_usr_353_t,25-Feb-23,

I've seen most of them, they are usually very entertaining and quite a lot of fun. But the last year have been a little hard on the two companies.What is wrong? Have the films outstayed their welcome? Is it the end of an era? Well, I don't hope so. This new Marvel film is not at all bad, it has a fantastivc cast. I think that the often use of Multiverses could be a problem. It's very much a part of this film too. It is for sure giving the writers a lot of opportunities, chances to expand the universes. But is that positive, not really, it gets a bit too much. But luckily still entertaining and fun.Ant-Man or Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) is a bit bored, not a lot to do as a superhero. He has written a book about his life as a crimefighting man capable of changing his size. The same capability as his wife Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) and as it shows also his daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton) posess.Together with Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) we witness how they all end up in another world because of a breakdown in an experiment conducted by Cassie.They end up in a place, that most of all could be taken out of a Star Wars film. Cassies have made this universe inhabited by a special animal, namely ants. These ants, we find out, are our heroes only allies in the fight that follows.It should be mentioned that a Lord that Janet knew and thought could be a help, also turns out to be a little selfish. It's the great Lord Krylar (played by the ever wonderful Bill Murray). How and if the battle is won by Ant-Man and his little (or perhaps big?) group of friends you'll have to see for yourself.As usual the film is filled with fine actors, but
the surprise is really Kathryn Newton, she certainly helps the film not to flop. And the good news are that she'll be staring in at least two coming Marvel films.",0,1,mogensenf,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur45430544/?ref_=tturv_usr_354_t,1-Jul-23,
6,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9257942/?ref_=tturv_perm_355,Safe entry into the MCU that feels small despite cosmic implications,"'Quantumania' is on the lower end of the MCU but it doesn't mean it's a bad movie. It's more of a standalone adventure that happens to feature not one but two generations of Ant-Man and the Wasp.The CGI effects for the Quantum Realm and the various action scenes look pretty; and lead to some rather original designs for the settings and creatures. I know that Marvel Studios has gotten flack for shortchanging their effects artists, but their work paid off here. There's some stellar imagery to behold in this movie.Paul Rudd is great in this along with Jonathan Majors as the new villain Kang the Conqueror. For all this movie's faults, Kang is not one of them. He's menacing in a subtle way but can be bombastic when the moment calls for it. But I will say it's strange that Kang is not in the movie as much as you would expect. With Rudd as Scott Lang, he's likable as usual and his motivations are immediately sympathetic. He's a good everyman for a weird story like this taking place in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.Returning cast members Michael Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Evangeline Lilly are not bad in this but it seems like they have less to do. Kathryn Newton takes over as Scott Lang's daughter Cassie and though not badly acted, her character is kind of annoying. It's one of those daughter characters who are written as a know-it-all in the mistaken belief that it makes them look smart.For all the controversy surrounding Bill Murray, which I think is overblown, he is not in the movie that much. It's a glorified cameo where he plays a very obscure Marvel character. Corey Stoll comes back as Darren Cross who in this universe becomes the hideous villain MODOK. This is a character who should be threatening but he's really more annoying than actually sinister.The movie just kind of feels overblown with the stunning visuals and scope. Yet also underwritten. A lot of key information is told via flashback or exposition dumps. As if it was a re-shoot or a scene was just cut. I will say it didn't feel long since it's about two hours and that feels like enough. It really doesn't waste time .Without going into spoilers too much, you do think the movie is setting up high stakes and for some characters to make the ultimate sacrifice.

If that was the vision they were going for, great job Peyton Reed. Also was it really necessary to have a cameo from an older comedic actor (I won't spoil who) that has been reportedly abusive on set.

4,/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8875582/?ref_=tturv_perm_362,"""It's All About Bucks, Kid. The Rest is Conversation.""","Another season, another entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is the thirty-first entry into the franchise and, like at least the last twelve before it, does nothing to renew or revitalize the cinematic behemoth's trite formula. Peyton Reed is back in the director's chair, enthusiastically kowtowing to the demands of producers and ensuring there is no detectable sense of style or personal touch.Quantumania plays like a cross between tediously scripted Saturday morning cartoon and embarrassingly generic Star Wars rip-off, evoking no sense of fun or wonder despite creative makeup, costuming, and digital landscapes. It's utterly disposable and completely forgettable, but the theater was full at 3:00 pm on a Thursday, so silver lining, it will line some cultural overlords' pockets with cash.The film follows Scott Lang and company as they're sucked into the quantum realm, a land of mind-bending vistas and infinite possibilities. As Lang discovers the secrets of the realm and tries to protect his daughter Cassie, a new threat rises. Kang the Conqueror, one of Marvel's most powerful villains, takes advantage of the newly available Pym Particles, enacting a savage plan to nebulously do something or another. The film also introduces M. O. D. O. K, immediately butchering his characterization and badassery.The MCU runs the gamut from inspired to miserably inept. Quantumania proudly slots into the center of the spectrum, not nearly as imaginative or well-crafted as Iron Man or Infinity War, but not as boring or portentous as Thor: The Dark World or Eternals. It squeezes so snugly into its predestined mediocrity that it's difficult to scrape up thoughts which haven't been said of any other MCU film from the last two years.The tone is still scatterbrained due to incessant quipping, the filmic craft is still laughably corporatized, the CGI is still creative and complex though horrendously fake-looking, the villain is still stripped of all complexity or intrigue, and the heroes are still indestructible paragons of status quo ubiquity.Specifically, Quantumania's story unfolds sluggishly before kicking into hyper-speed. There's hardly time for character introductions, let alone character growth. A few minutes' stretch sets up a story of trust, subversion, and calculation, but is quickly bolled over for an overplayed, gratingly uninspired rebellion angle. By the time our characters are situated in this strange new world, the final act has started, and quickly becomes a typically rote slog.None of the performances elevate the film, though Paul Rudd is eminently likeable and Michael Douglas plays up to the stupidity of the material, charismatically smartassing his way through the adventure. Kathryn Newton is charming enough, Michelle Pfeiffer lends legitimacy to the inanity, and Evangeline Lilly...doesn't really have much to do, honestly.Jonathan Majors is the disappointment of the cast, always just teetering on the verge of sobbing no matter the scene or context. Kang is an all-powerful force of destruction, but Majors plays him like he never left the set for The Last Black Man in San Francisco. He's a great actor, but not an intimidator - he may have added thirty extra pounds of muscle to transform into a daunting presence in Creed III, but he didn't here; all he has here is a cool-looking cloak.What else is there to extrapolate after thirty previous entries? For perspective, the Bond franchise has been running for sixty years and just recently celebrated the twenty-fifth entry into its franchise, and where Bond has reasonably shifted its values, identity, and presence throughout several decades, the MCU continuously doubles down on its commitment to assembly line productions.The true shame is that, despite the staggering volume of the genre over the last twenty years, its context and potential for alteration (fundamental or superficial) has hardly been mined. Imagine a three-hour sweeping superhero epic, a dusty superhero western, or a psychological horror of superpowered insanity, all of varying budgets, tones, moods, styles, and complexity.Take the thought further - hire legendary filmmakers like David Lynch, Paul Thomas Anderson, Darron Aronofsky, the Coen Brothers, David Fincher, or (your favorite filmmaker). Sure, not everyone would go for the idea, but those who do would surely produce something of staggering ingenuity and creativity; the inexhaustible subtext of a superpowered world could be explored for decades, and these production companies have limitless resources to explore it.All a pipedream. Rather than force their audiences to grow up, Marvel and DC eagerly cater to their infantilized, developmentally arrested fanbases, slapping together content like Chinese day laborers, desperate to keep the dopamine perpetually dripping. Guardians of the Galaxy 3 will be here soon, The Marvels soon after that.Writing this review was tedious enough; I cower to think of recording thoughts for MCU film number thirty-eight, number thirty-nine, forty, forty-one, onward and onward for eternity, until the Canadians invade, the dollar collapses, or The Living Tribunal is caught in a human trafficking scheme.

Do you like the cgi because it's interesting to look at or dislike it because it's technically average cgi. Can you make sense out of all the plot holes and contrivances? Did you like both halves of the movie or prefer one? Ant Man and the Wasp Quantumania has odds stacked against it because the way it is designed to go for the extremes of the type of experience it wants you to have.The extremes in question is technical aspects of the filmmaking (cgi, fight scenes, script) but also the tone. The ideas feel much larger than the movie lends itself to be. The fight scenes go from can go from well shot to disorientating. Script is seemingly full of plot holes, but also feels as if fans could have answers to everything. The movie seems to casually move about without trying to answer many questions I had regarding plot holes/contrivances. It wants you to just accept how it gets from point A to Z.I enjoyed the cgi. It wasn't ""great"" cgi, but I liked the way it looked for the world that it's set in. I also had some laughs, enjoyed many of the action scenes, and enjoyed Bill Murray a lot. Unfortunately, most everything I liked was in the first half of the movie. After the introduction of the villain, I slowly lost interest. 100 minutes in, the movie felt like it outstayed it's welcome. What happened was Ant Man decided to go larger and thus failed to feel darker.

The sequel had much better spectacle - it was genuinely stunning at times; it's nearly enough to let me ignore the heavy Flanderization of all of our established characters. Now we have the third movie, and somehow we've ended up with the worst of both worlds.The characters have lost all sense of individuality and urgency that they had in the first film, or what little of it they had back then. The ensemble plays off as that of a mid-day American sitcom, and not one of the ones that anybody really emjoys sitting down and watching actively. Full scenes dedicated to Scott's asides are not even the least bit funny as every joke is incredibly obvious and surface-level, oddly sandwiching the film with an incredibly cringe-worthy opening and ending that feel entirely useless. I don't think I have been so disengaged with any piece of media since I saw The Emoji Movie, though there are some sequences where this film at least creeps up to just being plain bad rather than abusively lazy. Scott has pics taken with peoples' dogs, he gets mistaken for Spider-Man, and he has a Hollywood-style panic attack that ends in an anti-climax that thinks it's much funnier than it is. These are the most memorable bits of the story due to their placement at the most crucial sections of the film, and that plays a huge role in sinking this movie's rating for me. It's like they wanted to numb viewers going into the film's first act, and then Sucker Punch them right at the end. This film is creative anaesthesia.Somehow, with so much special effects and so much money dumped into it, this film manages to be the ugliest film in all of the MCU. I'm sure the special effects actually made the film worse. They spent countless resources ruining their sub-par film to turn it into one of the worst films I've seen in years. M. O. D. O. K. Is shocking; there was a time when Marvel was churning out visually stunning films back-to-back. Even if the other elements of the films were lacking, you could at least rely on popcorn entertainment, but not here. For the first time in the MCU I'm replused by the special effects more often than not - this was trending with some underbaked effects in Black Panther and Black Widow, but I didn't expect it to get to this point so quickly. This feels more like a low-budget TV film managing to seem bigger than it should be through clever effects, but it's a huge big-budget Hollywood film that's crippled by sloppy effects and messy environments through the vast majority of the film. I can only imagine this is due to a lack of cohesive, or decent, artistic direction; the incredibly poor money management on display here is insulting. I've never seen a better example of how bloated film budgets are on the verge of destroying the film industry as a whole, and by this point I'm almost hoping for it to happen already. After the pandemic we just got out of, the last thing we need are thousands of unincredible films that think they're worth our time. At a certain point I just have to say enough is enough and file for a divorce from corporate films.Quantumania turns the infinitesimal quantum realm into a busy mess nearly as sloppy as its slapdash script.I guess the team behind Quantumania just didn't quite understand what ""less is more"" really means.",2,1,Scarefish,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur16028603/?ref_=tturv_usr_369_t,10-Sep-23,

I wanted to see a film, and help my Disney shares.Having not seen the events of the last two films, I can't state why Scott is Ant Man. We open in normal San Francisco, Paul Rudd wrote a book about the events of the last film. He picks up his daughter from prison, (who is also an ant daughter?) his family, along with Michael Douglas get swept into this other dimension. This point was when I kept asking myself , what the heck is going on?The whole film felt far too cartoony, like this made for children. I don't hate Marvel, but, I always feel like I'm watching a movie for kids. Bill Murray makes a fun cameo, but he's in for only 5 minutes. They have a character, a central charcter, named MODOK (?) , which is a giant head.

Unfortunately this isn't the hit movie that changes things for Ant-Man or Marvel. It has some good moments, and cool visuals. However if you look a little deeper, a lot of things stand out. Like the fact that they were harvesting quantum energy from the quantum realm in the post credits of the last movie, yet Janet didn't seem concerned, even though she is very worried about the quantum realm, which they show in the trailer, so it's not something you'd only gather from watching the movie. Her backstory was kept quiet because they hadn't thought of it yet. Usually they keep things open for other Marvel movies, but this story felt very tacked on for the sake of this movie. Hope had some moments, but very little dialogue. Also, I thought I dozed off, as this movie seemed to jump from a long first act, to the third act. Jonathan Majors (Kang) does all the heavy lifting in this movie. His story, and his motivations seem the most developed.

That's why I take my time before reviewing this plus a couple of rewatch. Ant-man and the Wasp Quantumania is quite solid to start phase 5, immediately introducing us to our new big-bad saga while Thanos merely just teased in the previous movies and finally makes a real presence in the last two of Infinity Saga. But the plot of the movie itself is a bit lacking on Kang's part, his ""grand"" introduction doesn't do enough justice after hyping him up in the first half and the climax is underwhelming also the pacing is somewhat inconsistent.

I can't say I was there since the beginning because I actually only started watching them religiously I'm cinemas since the first Avengers film - everything before that I watched retrospectively on DVD or Bluray. But anyway the first Antman film I quite enjoyed, it was humorous and action packed without being too over-the-top. The 2nd Antman film - Antman and The Wasp - was mostly pretty good but I didn't really like backstory of the villain that much. That brings us to Quantumania aka Antman 3. Since Spiderman Far From Home, I personally feel the Marvel films have become mostly lifeless and unintelligent. Sadly, although not the worst of the post Thanos storyline films, Antman 3 is nowhere near as good as it's predecessors. You could argue the stakes are higher sure and the scale of the story is huge which it is but there's also nothing new being done here... they've added in Scotts daughter Cassy as a new Antman (Antgirl?) and she's just a pointless as a character if you ask me and verh forgetable even though they try make her funny and integral to the story. The returning characters don't seem to have any depth to them and in some cases appear to have changed personalities to when we saw them last so I felt cheated. The overall story also retcons what we knew of the quantum realm.... and it's all explained away with a ""this is different."" Seriously that's it. Another bad aspect of this whole film though was the poor CGI and design. Some characters were dead basic looking and boring whilst backgrounds were bland and at times noticeably fake taking me out of the movie. Anyway, there was a couple things I did enjoy and one of those was MODOK. I usually don't like it when films change character backstories but this I didn't mind at all because it made sense and it was hilarious. The other thing I liked was Kang. I liked how he was portrayed, I liked his design and I liked how he was powerful yet still noticeably vulnerable. Kang by himself is not a Thanos level threat but as we saw during the mid credits scene, I think an army of Kangs probably is!Final Verdict: It really only serves the purpose of introducing Kang to the MCU and admittedly, it does that very well. Everything else about it is mostly forgettable except for MODOK who steals the scene. It's not as funny as previous Antman films and also not as smart, characters act differently and the CGI can be very hut and miss.",1,0,Classic_Boxing_Matches,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur154782775/?ref_=tturv_usr_385_t,9-Jun-23,

I'm beginning to believe my comic book fan brother who for years has said the MCU is geared toward children as these last two phases for sure just don't seem to tackle their stories with any depth or coherency to them.But the pros...Jonathan Majors not only landed this role but delivered more than I had expected. With different writing I feel even he could have been more but with what he had to work with, he gave us so much...definitely one of the best performances in the MCU.

Though I very much like the main characters in the first two movies those same characters just didn't have that likeable vibe as in the previous two movies.The CGI reminded me way too much of Star Wars with a pinch of Avatar. Here's a question, when Thanos snapped his fingers, half of all life everywhere ceased to exist, why didn't it affect the quantum realm?

The film follows Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) and Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) as they explore the Quantum Realm, a subatomic dimension where they encounter strange creatures and a powerful villain named Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors).The film has a lot of visual spectacle and creativity, as it showcases the wonders and dangers of the Quantum Realm. The action scenes are well-choreographed and entertaining, especially when Ant-Man and Wasp use their shrinking and growing abilities to fight their enemies. The film also introduces some new characters, such as Cassie Lang (Kathryn Newton), Scott's teenage daughter who becomes a political activist, and Jentorra (Katy O'Brian), a Mandalorian-like warrior who helps them in their quest.However, the film also suffers from some flaws that prevent it from being a great movie. The plot is convoluted and messy, as it tries to juggle too many elements and subplots without giving them enough development or coherence. The film also lacks the humor and charm that made the previous Ant-Man movies so enjoyable, as it takes itself too seriously and loses some of the fun factor. The film also makes some tonal departures from the earlier films, as it deals with darker themes such as trauma, guilt, and genocide.The most disappointing aspect of the film is Kang the Conqueror, who is supposed to be the new main antagonist of the MCU. While Jonathan Majors gives a good performance, his character is poorly written and underdeveloped. He is introduced too abruptly and without much explanation or motivation, making him seem like a generic and bland villain. He also does not pose much of a threat to Ant-Man and Wasp, as they easily defeat him in the end.Overall, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania 2023 is a mixed bag of a movie. It has some positive aspects, such as the visual effects, the action scenes, and some of the performances, but it also has some negative aspects, such as the plot, the screenplay, and Kang the Conqueror. It is not a terrible movie, but it is not a great one either.

Almost seeming to have mastered the formula for producing consistently good/fun action/comedy/spectacle movies with almost no clunkers, since Phase 3 ended, I'd say the MCU has produced...MAYBE one okay movie (Spider-Man: No Way Home) and quite a few mediocre to poor ones. Quantumania breaks that streak by being absolutely AWFUL. Easily the worst MCU movie since Thor 2.What went wrong? Well, first of all, what made the first two Ant-Man's fun? It was the hilarious and unexpected set pieces of things and people changing sizes unexpectedly and in ways that tickled the funny bone. In the quantum realm...everything is so alien that there aren't really meaningful opportunities to use this mechanic creatively. The movie effectively gives away it's greatest strength by it's very premise.The world-building of QM is also...bizarre and inconsistent in ways that make the plot have no stakes, the viewer can have no expectations to be met or subverted because no rules are every presented. Indeed, we are reminded over and over again that there are no rules. Every weird thing is just another weird thing. None of it has any weight or meaning.The movie does VERY rarely make head nods to hollywood-izations of quantum mechanics concepts...but not in any way that is interesting. Not in any way where you go 'oh, thats clever'.I hinted at it already, but there's also really no stakes. The way the MCU is positioning Kang is that he's his own disposable villain. Which kind of ruins him. You can kill off as many as you like, there's always more. That doesn't make him more compelling, it makes him LESS. Oh no, this one might escape? BFD, there's billions of them out there anyway. We also seem to be using a villain whose main schtick is time travel in a way that ... doesn't really involve much time travel. It's just an excuse for why he has crazy technology.The daughter plot feels forced and doesn't resonate. Hope is little more than wallpaper, as is Hank. Janet gets some play...but she's so evasively mysterious that it's hard to give a crap about her.And where was the humor? Paul Rudd is first and foremost a comedic actor. And yet...this might well be the least funny MCU movie since ... again, I have to go clear back to Thor 2 or maybe even Hulk. Why is there so little funny in this movie that should, like the Guardians series, be the comedic tentpoles of the MCU?I made it through the whole movie. So i can't rate it TOO low because I tend to quit on things that are that bad. But this wasn't good.

It would have been the best 5-10 minutes of any film to be fair. Yes he could have been fitted in at the beginning. Such a shame. He was the one who gave humor, charm, and attractiveness to the two previous films. For your information, I have to admit that Michael Peña is the only reason I watched Antman (2015) film for the first place. Even if for a small cameo I think Michael Peña would be fine about it considering we don't know if he dusted of Thanos's snap effect. Double disappointment is because they recasted Cassie from Endgame. Apart from that, only the performance of Jonathan Majors as Kang The Conqueror saved this film. Lord Krylar, Jentorra, and Quaz unfortunately they were so easily forgotten. And M. O. D. O. K was not what I imagined or expected, especially the action towards the end. Scott Lang / Ant-Man, Hope Van Dyne / The Wasp, Dr. Hank Pym, and Janet Van Dyne is good as usual.

Unfortunately, I was ultimately let down.The overarching plot was pretty good. I liked the arcs our characters had, particularly Scott and Cassie Lang. But the minor details are where things get messy. We get introduced to so many new characters, concepts, and story details in the quantum realm, resulting in an overall film that is not very digestible. There is too much going on and not enough time to fully flesh out the details.The dialogue is pretty poorly written. At some points in the film, I was literally laughing out loud at what the characters were saying. It felt exactly like a TikTok skit exaggerating and mocking superhero movies. Cassie Lang has one line that is probably THE MOST CRINGY LINE EVER SPOKEN IN THE MCU.The performances were decent overall. Most of the acting in the Ant-Man films is a little cheesy and campy, which mostly works in the small-scale stories they tell. But with the large, expanding story that the film is attempting to deliver, it just felt cheap. Kang is really amazing. Jonathan Majors was a tier above the rest of the cast; I can't wait to see more of him but also feel like he was wasted here.Finally, the visuals were really inconsistent. Some scenes looked quite good, with interesting and detailed settings, while others clearly featured three characters standing in front of a green screen. I mean, in some scenes I swear I could see slight black outlines from the keying technology. Where is the budget going in these films? They really need to slow down in postproduction because this is becoming a major theme. One thing I will note is that I thought MODOK looked really good. It was always going to be difficult to pull off a live action version of him, but they did a stellar job.Overall, I am pretty disappointed in the movie, but the movie gave me enough to make this a somewhat average experience. The MCU needs to pick it up this year because it is on a major downward trajectory.Score: 38%

There are also frequent broad jarring jokes which take you out of the movie. The root cause of the issues is it was written by Jeff Loveness, who's biggest credits are TV shows including Jimmy Kimmel live & Rick & Morty. NOT epic action adventure movies. Really glad I didn't pay good money to see it. There's no attempt to create a cohesive narrative with some internal logic which respects the characters or the audience. The good points are the visuals which are interesting & Jonathan Majors performance as Kang which was impressive, quite a feat considering the storm of irritating, silliness surrounding him.

There are however too many characters and too many character arcs being crammed in to a 2 hour movie for us to really engage with any of them properly.I've no idea why they felt the need to bring in one of the most ridiculous villains that ever disgraced the pages of a marvel comic book.. but they did and even though the character arc isn't terrible it just added more bloat to an already busy script.There are tonal imbalances too . On the one hand we have the Paul Rudd comedy voice over and on the other we have the death of trillions of sentient beings.Its not Love and Thunder or Black Panther 2 levels of bad but its not up to the standards set before EndGame.On a par with Dr Strange and the multiverse of whatever perhaps.,0,0,johndavidson-1,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur3512547/?ref_=tturv_usr_405_t,4-Mar-23,

Not many people understand the concept of space-time continuum or quantum physics. But Marvel surely integrated those concepts with this Ant Man movie.For those haters out there, you must understand first the basics of those 2 concepts. It has been theorized by Einstein that everything at subatomic level consist purely of probability. There's no certain way to determine whether an object is at one place or at multiple place at the same time. Also at subatomic level, time does not exist in a linear fashion as we human perceive it. Hence everything related to space and time at subatomic level can be purely fantasy or purely science fiction.That is exactly what Marvel did with Quantumania. They created a purely fantasy universe where everything can just be anything and at any place all at once. It's the reason why you can see people or objects can replicate themselves. It's the reason why you can see a ""Star Wars"" atmosphere in this movie. It's the reason why all of geek's imagination come to live in this universe. So it's actually a perfect realization of the ""quantum universe"" here.As for the story line, it make perfect sense. There's no exageration. Every character behave the way they should be and the story progress as how it should be. You don't have to care of what it shows in the comic books, because if it's entirely the same as the comic books, then it is useless to see the movie. So don't complain about the different expectation here.In short, this Ant Man movie is a grand spectacle for everyone, especially for ""Star Wars"" fans.",7,19,varnium,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur29238510/?ref_=tturv_usr_408_t,26-Feb-23,

He's genuinely played well, but you go through an hour before he really comes on screen.The quantum people are interesting looking, but written like a smurf cartoon. The battles are the same CGI BS battles you've seen in every other movie.The first Teo movies are far better. The music, the capers, and the characters work well. In this, it's just boring.I'm sure MCU fans like it. Please go ahead and enjoy yourself. But, for people who are just passing time, it would be better you skip it.Biggest issues:

While it has its entertaining moments, the film ultimately falls flat due to several key issues.One of the major shortcomings is the lack of stakes and danger to the main character. There is no real sense of urgency or tension, and the story fails to make the audience invested in the outcome.Additionally, the film's villain is portrayed as powerful and threatening at first, but is easily defeated in the end. This not only makes the villain feel weak and forgettable, but also removes any sense of real danger for the heroes.However, the movie is not without its highlights. Paul Rudd's performance as Ant Man is enjoyable, and there are some visually stunning scenes that are a treat to watch.Overall, Ant Man Quantumania is a middle-of-the-road Marvel movie that doesn't quite reach the heights of the franchise's best entries.

It is definitely more brutal and serious, but still had its moments when I felt familiar with the movie. With that said there were scenes were I was like ' I've seen that somewhere else'. Known cliches and jokes are included. I find them funny. The CGI for the fights and specially for the scenes where Scott multiplies himself multiple times were cool. I'm really not a fan ob having basically too much CGI in a movie, but this movie needs that and I'm convinced, that had they had more budget they'd have done even more into CGI. Although I enjoyed the movie it should've been different cause some scenes felt like they were shorten to fit the screen time which is understandable. The issue is there were too many characters into the plot. I get the message it's more of a family adventurous movie. Hank+Janet+Hope+Scott+Cassie, but just for me Hope felt unnecessary for the plot. Janet was necessary because she already was there and has a secret to tell. I wouldn't rate this movie low or very high. It's a 7/10 for me and a decent introduction for Phase 5.Paul Rudd's performance is convincing, vividly and charming. I don't remember one movie I didn't enjoy with him. He's Ant-Man. His performance was hilarious and mushy in deep moments.Two days ago I've went to the local cinema to finally witness Kang The Conquerer in action. Jonathan Majors was brilliant he embodies the character in such an unique way. He can play it off real quick from a soft and sad character into an terrifying dangerous threat. That's some amazing act and needs to be called. I was surprised about the dynamic between Janet & Kang.

It's as if Marvel was purchased by a third-world company and produced a movie solely to impress themselves. While the storyline may make sense to younger viewers, it falls short for true Marvel fans.",10,5,sepetcenk,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0860599/?ref_=tturv_usr_431_t,23-Apr-23,

They ruined Ant-Man a bit. Kang too was not as enigmatic and intense as he was in Loki, but yet he shows huge potential as a very powerful character by the end. So not all hope is lost.

The last of the Ant-Man films, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is directed by Peyton Reed. It stars Kathryn Newton, Michelle Pfeiffer, Evangeline Lilly, Katy M. O'Brian from Black lightning and The Mandalorian, Bill Murray from Ghostbusters: Afterlife, and Tony McCarthy from Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledor, Cruella, Black Widow, and The Batman.-Plot:
After a grownup Cassandra Lang's (Kathryn Newton) invention gets the team (Hank Pym, Hope Pym, Scott Lang, Cassandra Lang and Janet Van Dyne), stuck in the quantum realm. The team finds themselves having to fight strange monsters and a very powerful Kang the Conqueror, (Jonathan Majors) who has been banished from another world for destroying many different universes throughout time. Kang has a multitude of powers that are far superior to any of the creatures living in the quantum realm and soon becomes in control of the realm. Before the team can return home, they must battle Kang and his army.-Visuals:
Maltu Sarmes and Axel Bonani created some innovative visual effects (VFX). The artists and technical team did an incredible job creating all the strange creatures in the quantum realm.-Action:
There is fighting when they go to the quantum realm due to them having to defeat Kang. Even though there is action and unique visuals, there's no substance to the plot except for the team trying to return home.-Conclusion:
If you like inventive visuals and lots of fighting, you might like this film. As for me I had a hard time staying awake during the two hours. My personal favorite Ant-Man film out of the trilogy is the first one. It had humor, action, and a storyline.",3,1,kimberlyely-27550,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur164699854/?ref_=tturv_usr_433_t,19-May-23,

It's nowhere near Marvel's standard and has some serious structural and writing issues, but also contains very strong elements.Those are mostly owed to Jonathan Majors, who's since Loki up there with the MCU's finest antagonists. His performance is clinical and powerful. He owns the screen in an almost shakespearean way and I'm excited to see him in Loki S2.Putting him against Ant-Man is a fun paring. The humour that goes hand in hand with Scott Lang contrasts the seriousness of Kang beautifully. The rest of the performances are all solid. Paul Rudd still loves to play Scott Lang, bringing in his natural witt and charm as loveable as ever.Kathryn Newton is a nice addition to the Marvel family, although I do think the chemistry between the two leaves space for improvement. Michelle Pfeiffer did a great job, doing the best she can overcoming the underwhelming writing of her character. Michael Douglas is always a delight to watch, allthough his presence gets more and more lost in the vast CGI void of the quantum realm.Where Quantumania really lets down is the second act. There's an aesthetic emptiness to everything that felt almost soul-crushing to me who so deeply connects to the MCU and it's lifelike world. The soulfull vibe of the first film is greatly missing here.Many elements feel shoehorned in and out of place.The writing of Janet was really annoying. She hummed and hawed around with everything she was doing and hesitated to inform her family about Kang for nearly 1 and a 1/2 hour straight until she suddenly broke out with the whole backstory of the two. Jeff Loveness has a big issue with dramaturgically natural script / character / dialogue development.The third act, with Kang moving into the spotlight, gladly comes with a slight shift in quality and tone. It also suddenly boasts some enjoyable visuals, with colour and vibrancy. The makeup, masks and costumes were really creative and I digged the Star Wars theme behind it all. The end fight with Kang and Scott was gripping and almost gave a feeling of fear for Scott which the rest of the movie never managed to create.All in all I see lots of potential for the rest of the multiverse saga, especially with Kang and his variants moving into the spotlight as we come closer to the big Avengers finale. But with Quantumania I have the clear feeling that the script was rushed to get the film out and give the audience a taste of Kang. They focused mostly on that and ultimately let down the actual stars of the movie Ant-Man and especially Wasp itself. They got sidelined in their own movie and haven't really undergone any character development. The credits in the end read - Kang will return. I think that speaks a lot of what we take from this film.The post credit scenes make you look forward to what is to come, but I can only hope Kevin Feige don't looses sight of what made the MCU so loved and successful since the very beginning: good writing.",1,2,cedricdumler,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur70857921/?ref_=tturv_usr_439_t,23-Feb-23,

It's a fun film; fitting with the tone of the first two.I have 2 gripes with this film, both cast related. First off, without Michael Pena, this isn't quite as funny. He stole the a lot of the scenes in the first 2 films. Also, I get why they recast the excellent Abby Ryder Fortson for Endgame (the actress would have been too young to play Cassie Lang for the 2023 time frame of Endgame (Emma Fuhrmann, 17 at the time of filming, fit Cassie's MCU age of 16 better, and actually resembled an older Fortson), so *that recasting* made sense. But in the time-frame of Quantumania (which takes places in 2025) Cassie's supposed to be 18, Furman was 21, but definitely could've played 18. Instead they recast someone even older... Katherine Newton was 25 during shooting, doesn't resemble the other 2 Cassies, nor quite as good an actress.Still, tons of action, comedy (that's funny within the context of the situation), and a mysterious backstory (but really only
mysterious if you haven't been watching the Disney+ MCU shows). It's a joyride, never a dull moment, although sometimes the plot meandered. It was nice that Janet and Hank got a lot more to do this time around.Modok (scene during the trailers) makes sense within the context of the MCU, Majors is appropriately mancing as Kang. I don't know what's with the low Rotton Tomatoes, I can't wait to see this again.A-, 9.1/103D: 3D usually doesn't work in dark movies (which was the downfall of both Wakanda Forever & Malificent's 3D), but surprisingly works here... when it matters. Scenes where the 3D wouldn't do much to enhance the experience, the 3D was practically non-existent. For scenes where it would make a difference, the stereoscopic imagining was pretty good (I noticed only 1 brief scene where the depth frustrums didn't line up creating a double image in the mid background, otherwise it was always clean)6.5/10 for the 3D.

Frankly, I'm glad that the movie was much different than the first two. I never really felt any suspense or excitement in those.The tone of the series gets a much needed makeover. The comedy is minimal, the suspense is much higher, and the producers finally found the right music to illustrate the mood. Best of all, Scott finally transforms himself from the clumsy, annoying character he used to be to the serious, valiant fighter that I've waited 8 years for.I wasn't a fan of all the goofy, CGI characters that were introduced. And as usual, the writers attempted to inject comedy where it simply doesn't fit. In fact, the first 15 minutes are actually very cringy. Since I can't give it a 7.5 rating, I'm rounding up to 8.

This is on the level of Vinnie Jones as Juggernaut, or Jar Jar Binks. It's really bad.Then there is the tropes that have become all too common for mcu movies at this point; large scale battle, cross cutting between individual characters, misplaced comedy... All detracts from at least one really powerful moment, that could have made the core of a fantastic movie, a moment when Scott regains his focus and works toward one goal rather than being drawn in all directions, that was very powerful.This is just the latest MCU product though and exhibits the same issues that I have been starting to notice in the past few years. At this point it's hard to ignore and it's stifling any creativity and good storytelling.

Personally aside from She Hulk, I have had nothing but complaints about this whole Disney Marvel thing.

The environment the weapons the characters of this universe even the costumes of the actors were like the movie was set in one of the planets of star cities no joke.Still I think Ant man is just a good movie.

With all the negative reactions and reviews I've been hearing, I'm wondering if I saw the same movie as everyone else.We pick up with Scott Lang, who is a character exactly like the actor who plays him (Paul Rudd), enjoying life and a certain level of fame as an Avenger who saved the universe in ""Endgame."" His daughter Cassie, played convincingly by Kathryn Newton, is a chip off the old block, so to speak. She's been working on something special, with the help of ol' Hank Pym (Michael Douglass) and Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) and soon the whole family is sucked down into the quantum realm by you-know-who.Michelle Pfeiffer surprised me when I knew I shouldn't be. Her performance as Janet Van Dyne is a reminder to all that she still has it. Janet and you-know-who had been marooned together for quite a long time, allies at first, but I'll let you watch the movie to get the rest of the story. The film does a wonderful job of slowly and simultaneously revealing the wonders of the quantum realm and Janet's role in the antagonist's re-emergence.Speaking of which, you-know-who is none other than Kang the Conqueror, the big bad of Marvel that will make Thanos seem like a warm-up. Jonathan Majors is the perfect actor to play Kang, and I mean perfect. He even has a similar face to many of the comic depictions of the villain. More importantly, Majors has the ability to play all the different variant personalities of Kang when it comes time... and considering the next Avengers movie has Kang in the title, I'm guessing we'll see several more of them.This adventure really is Star Wars-esque in its presentation and feel. Peyton Reed is on it, man, and he even found a way to include a nutty character like M. O. D. O. K. I saw this in 2D, but the directing of Reed may lead me to try and find a 3D version before it leaves the theaters.""Quantumania"" is better than any of the Phase 4 movies not named ""Spider-Man.,"" and I'd say in the top half of all MCU films.
